<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Jeffrey Binder is a PhD student in English at CUNY who specializes in nineteenth century American literature, digital humanities, and critical theory.  Jeff comes to the humanities from a background in computer programming, and much of his work involves putting new digital technologies into dialogue with their historical precedents.  He is especially interested in the explosion in the nineteenth century of highly-structured textual forms such as indexes, tables, mathematical notations, and paperwork that are both directly connected to the development of computers and deeply integrated into the structures of modern political and business institutions.  He also works on the relationship of rhetoric and literary style to American conceptions of public space, and on the ways American authors (especially Melville) have negotiated the tension between individual belief and the conventional nature of language.</p>


<p>Collin Jennings is a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Experimental Humanities program at Bard College. He received his Ph.D. in American and English Literature from New York University. His work uses computational methods to explore lexical and syntactic patterns in eighteenth-century literary genres that experimented with new forms of arrangement.</p>
