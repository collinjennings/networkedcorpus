description: "Comparing the Enlightenment Index and a 21st-Century Topic Model"
---

<p>This <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/wealth/topic-index.html">networked version</a> of Adam Smith's <i>Wealth of Nations</i> (1776) features a comparative view of Smith's systematic subject index for the work and a topic model trained on the text. Smith's friend and fellow lecturer on rhetoric and <i>belles lettres</i>, Hugh Blair, encouraged Smith to create an index for the work that exhibited a "scientifical view of the whole." We present the comparison between index and topic model as a way to produce a new perspective on the rhetorical and epistemological work of Smith's index.</p>
