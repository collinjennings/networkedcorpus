It would be a noble Improvement, or rather a Recovery of what we <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec104.txt')">call</a>
good Breeding, if nothing were to pass amongst us for <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec104.txt')">agreeable</a> which
was the least Transgression against that Rule of Life called Decorum, or
a Regard to Decency. This would command the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec104.txt')">Respect</a> of Mankind, because
it carries in it Deference to their good Opinion, as Humility lodged in
a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec104.txt')">worthy</a> Mind is always attended with a certain Homage, which no haughty
Soul, with all the Arts imaginable, will ever be able to purchase.
_Tully_ says, Virtue and Decency are so nearly related, that it is
difficult to separate them from each other but in our Imagination. As
the <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec104.txt')">Beauty</a> of the Body always accompanies the Health of it, so certainly
is Decency concomitant to Virtue: As Beauty of Body, with an agreeable
Carriage, pleases the Eye, and that Pleasure consists in that we observe
all the Parts with a certain Elegance are proportioned to each other; so
does Decency of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec104.txt')">Behaviour</a> which appears in our Lives obtain the
Approbation of all with whom we converse, from the Order, Consistency,
and Moderation of our Words and Actions. This flows from the Reverence
we bear towards every good Man, and to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec104.txt')">World</a> in general; for to be
negligent of what any one thinks of you, does not only shew you arrogant
but abandoned. In all these Considerations we are to distinguish how one
Virtue differs from another; As it is the Part of Justice never to do
Violence, it is of Modesty never to commit Offence. In this last
Particular lies the whole Force of what is called Decency; to this
purpose that excellent Moralist above-mentioned talks of Decency; but
this Quality is more easily comprehended by an ordinary Capacity, than
expressed with all his Eloquence. This Decency of Behaviour is generally
transgressed among all Orders of Men; nay, the very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec104.txt')">Women</a>, tho'
themselves created as it were for Ornament, are often very much mistaken
in this ornamental Part of Life. It would methinks be a short Rule for
Behaviour, if every <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec104.txt')">young</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec104.txt')">Lady</a> in her <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec104.txt')">Dress</a>, Words, and Actions were
only to recommend her self as a Sister, Daughter, or Wife, and make
herself the more esteemed in one of those Characters. The Care of
themselves, with regard to the Families in which Women are born, is the
best Motive for their being courted to come into the Alliance of other
Houses. Nothing can promote this End more than a strict Preservation of
Decency. I should be glad if a certain Equestrian Order of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec104.txt')">Ladies</a>, some
of whom one meets in an Evening at every Outlet of the Town, would take
this Subject into their serious Consideration; In order thereunto the
following Letter may not be wholly unworthy their Perusal. [1]</p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Going lately to take the Air in one of the most beautiful Evenings
this Season has produced, as I was admiring the Serenity of the Sky,
the lively Colours of the Fields, and the Variety of the Landskip
every Way around me, my Eyes were suddenly called off from these
inanimate Objects by a little party of Horsemen I saw passing the
Road. The greater Part of them escaped my particular Observation, by
reason that my whole Attention was fixed on a very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec104.txt')">fair</a> Youth who rode
in the midst of them, and seemed to have been <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec104.txt')">dressed</a> by some
Description in a Romance. His Features, Complexion, and Habit had a
remarkable Effeminacy, and a certain languishing Vanity appeared in
his Air: His Hair, well curl'd and powder'd, hung to a considerable
Length on his Shoulders, and was wantonly ty'd, as if by the Hands of
his Mistress, in a Scarlet Ribbon, which played like a Streamer behind
him: He had a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec104.txt')">Coat</a> and Wastecoat of blue Camlet trimm'd and
embroidered with Silver; a Cravat of the finest Lace; and wore, in a
smart Cock, a little Beaver <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec104.txt')">Hat</a> edged with Silver, and made more
sprightly by a Feather. His Horse too, which was a Pacer, was adorned
after the same airy <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec104.txt')">Manner</a>, and seemed to share in the Vanity of the
Rider. As I was pitying the Luxury of this young Person, who appeared
to me to have been educated only as an Object of Sight, I perceived on
my nearer Approach, and as I turned my Eyes downward, a Part of the
Equipage I had not observed before, which was a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec104.txt')">Petticoat</a> of the same
with the Coat and Wastecoat. After this Discovery, I looked again on
the Face of the fair _Amazon_ who had thus deceived me, and thought
those Features which had before offended me by their Softness, were
now strengthened into as improper a Boldness; and tho' her Eyes Nose
and Mouth seemed to be formed with perfect Symmetry, I am not certain
whether she, who in Appearance was a very handsome Youth, may not be
in Reality a very indifferent <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec104.txt')">Woman</a>.</p><p>There is an Objection which naturally presents it self against these
occasional Perplexities and Mixtures of Dress, which is, that they
seem to break in upon that Propriety and Distinction of Appearance in
which the Beauty of different Characters is preserved; and if they
should be more frequent than they are at <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec104.txt')">present</a>, would look like
turning our publick Assemblies into a general Masquerade. The Model of
this _Amazonian_ Hunting-Habit for Ladies, was, as I take it, first
imported from _France_, and well enough expresses the Gaiety of a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec104.txt')">People</a> who are taught to do any thing so it be with an Assurance; but
I cannot help thinking it sits awkwardly yet on our _English_ Modesty.
The Petticoat is a kind of Incumbrance upon it, and if the _Amazons_
should think fit to go on in this Plunder of our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec104.txt')">Sex</a>'s Ornaments, they
ought to add to their Spoils, and compleat their Triumph over us, by
wearing the Breeches.</p><p>If it be natural to contract insensibly the Manners of those we
imitate, the Ladies who are pleased with assuming our Dresses will do
us more <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec104.txt')">Honour</a> than we deserve, but they will do it at their own
Expence. Why should the lovely _Camilla_ deceive us in more Shapes
than her own, and affect to be represented in her Picture with a Gun
and a Spaniel, while her elder Brother, the Heir of a worthy Family,
is drawn in Silks like his Sister? The Dress and Air of a Man are not
well to be divided; and those who would not be content with the
Latter, ought never to think of assuming the Former. There is so large
a portion of natural Agreeableness among the Fair Sex of our Island,
that they seem betrayed into these romantick Habits without having the
same Occasion for them with their Inventors: All that needs to be
desired of them is, that they would _be themselves_, that is, what
Nature designed them; and to see their Mistake when they depart from
this, let them look upon a Man who affects the Softness and Effeminacy
of a Woman, to learn how their Sex must appear to us, when approaching
to the Resemblance of a Man.</p><p>_I am_, SIR,
_Your most humble Servant_.</p><p>
