My <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec105.txt')">Friend</a> WILL. HONEYCOMB values himself very much upon what he calls
the <a name="topic23" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec105.txt')">Knowledge</a> of Mankind, which has cost him many Disasters in his
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec105.txt')">Youth</a>; for WILL. reckons every Misfortune that he has met with among the
Women, and every Rencounter among the Men, as Parts of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec105.txt')">Education</a>,
and fancies he should never have been the Man he is, had not he broke
Windows, knocked down Constables, disturbed honest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec105.txt')">People</a> with his
Midnight Serenades, and beat up a lewd Woman's Quarters, when he was a
young Fellow. The engaging in Adventures of this Nature WILL. calls the
studying of Mankind; and terms this Knowledge of the Town, the Knowledge
of the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec105.txt')">World</a>. WILL. ingenuously confesses, that for half his Life his
Head ached every Morning with reading of Men over-night; and at present
comforts himself under certain Pains which he endures from time to time,
that without them he could not have been acquainted with the Gallantries
of the Age. This WILL. looks upon as the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec105.txt')">Learning</a> of a Gentleman, and
regards all other kinds of Science as the Accomplishments of one whom he
calls a Scholar, a Bookish Man, or a Philosopher.</p><p>For these Reasons WILL. shines in mixt <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec105.txt')">Company</a>, where he has the
Discretion not to go out of his Depth, and has often a certain way of
making his real Ignorance appear a seeming one. Our Club however has
frequently caught him tripping, at which times they never spare him. For
as WILL. often insults us with the Knowledge of the Town, we sometimes
take our Revenge upon him by our Knowledge [of [1]] Books.</p><p>He was last Week producing two or three Letters which he writ in his
Youth to a Coquet Lady. The Raillery of them was natural, and well
enough for a mere Man of the Town; but, very unluckily, several of the
<a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec105.txt')">Words</a> were wrong spelt. WILL. laught this off at first as well as he
could; but finding himself pushed on all sides, and especially by the
_Templar_, he told us, with a little Passion, that he never liked
Pedantry in Spelling, and that he spelt like a Gentleman, and not like a
Scholar: Upon this WILL. had recourse to his old Topick of shewing the
narrow-Spiritedness, the Pride, and Ignorance of Pedants; which he
carried so far, that upon my retiring to my Lodgings, I could not
forbear throwing together such Reflections as occurred to me upon that
Subject.</p><p>A Man [who [2]] has been brought up among Books, and is able to talk of
nothing else, is a very indifferent Companion, and what we <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec105.txt')">call</a> a
Pedant. But, methinks, we should enlarge the Title, and give it every
one that does not know how to think out of his Profession and particular
way of Life.</p><p>What is a greater Pedant than a meer Man of the Town? Bar him the
Play-houses, a Catalogue of the reigning Beauties, and an Account of a
few fashionable Distempers that have befallen him, and you strike him
dumb. How many a pretty Gentleman's Knowledge lies all within the Verge
of the Court? He will tell you the Names of the principal Favourites,
repeat the shrewd Sayings of a Man of Quality, whisper an Intreague that
is not yet blown upon by common <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec105.txt')">Fame</a>; or, if the Sphere of his
Observations is a little larger than ordinary, will perhaps enter into
all the Incidents, Turns, and Revolutions in a Game of Ombre. When he
has gone thus far he has shown you the whole Circle of his
Accomplishments, his Parts are drained, and he is disabled from any
further <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec105.txt')">Conversation</a>. What are these but rank Pedants? and yet these are
the Men [who [3]] value themselves most on their Exemption from the
Pedantry of Colleges.</p><p>I might here mention the Military Pedant who always talks in a Camp, and
is storming Towns, making Lodgments and fighting Battles from one end of
the Year to the other. Every thing he speaks smells of Gunpowder; if you
take away his Artillery from him, he has not a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec105.txt')">Word</a> to say for himself.
I might likewise mention the Law-Pedant, that is perpetually putting
Cases, repeating the Transactions of _Westminster-Hall_, wrangling with
you upon the most indifferent Circumstances of Life, and not to be
convinced of the Distance of a Place, or of the most trivial Point in
Conversation, but by dint of Argument. The State-Pedant is wrapt up in
News, and lost in Politicks. If you mention either of the Kings of
_Spain_ or _Poland_, he talks very notably; but if you go out of the
_Gazette_, you drop him. In short, a meer Courtier, a meer Soldier, a
meer Scholar, a meer any thing, is an insipid Pedantick Character, and
equally ridiculous.</p><p>Of all the Species of Pedants, which I have [mentioned [4]], the
Book-Pedant is much the most supportable; he has at least an exercised
Understanding, and a Head which is full though confused, so that a Man
who converses with him may often receive from him hints of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec105.txt')">things</a> that
are worth knowing, and what he may possibly turn to his own Advantage,
tho' they are of little Use to the Owner. The worst <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec105.txt')">kind</a> of Pedants
among Learned Men, are such as are naturally endued with a very small
Share of common Sense, and have read a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec105.txt')">great</a> number of Books without
Taste or Distinction.</p><p>The Truth of it is, Learning, like Travelling, and all other Methods of
Improvement, as it finishes good Sense, so it makes a silly Man ten
thousand times more insufferable, by supplying variety of Matter to his
Impertinence, and giving him an Opportunity of abounding in Absurdities.</p><p>Shallow Pedants cry up one another much more than Men of solid and
useful Learning. To read the Titles they give an Editor, or Collator of
a Manuscript, you would take him for the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec105.txt')">Glory</a> of the Commonwealth of
Letters, and the Wonder of his Age, when perhaps upon Examination you
find that he has only Rectify'd a _Greek_ Particle, or laid out a whole
Sentence in proper Commas.</p><p>They are obliged indeed to be thus lavish of their Praises, that they
may keep one another in Countenance; and it is no wonder if a great deal
of Knowledge, which is not capable of making a Man wise, has a natural
Tendency to make him Vain and Arrogant.</p><p>L.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: in]</p><p>
