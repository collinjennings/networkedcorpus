At a little distance from Sir ROGER'S House, among the Ruins of an old
Abby, there is a long Walk of aged Elms; which are shot up so very high,
that when one passes under them, the Rooks and Crows that rest upon the
Tops of them seem to be cawing in another Region. I am very much
delighted with this sort of Noise, which I consider as a kind of natural
Prayer to that Being who supplies the Wants of his whole Creation, and
[who], in the <a name="topic21" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec110.txt')">beautiful</a> Language of the _Psalms_, feedeth the young
Ravens that <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec110.txt')">call</a> upon him. I like this [Retirement [1]] the better,
because of an ill Report it lies under of being _haunted_; for which
<a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec110.txt')">Reason</a> (as I have been told in the Family) no living Creature ever walks
in it besides the Chaplain. My good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec110.txt')">Friend</a> the Butler desired me with a
very grave Face not to venture my self in it after Sun-set, for that one
of the Footmen had been almost frighted out of his Wits by a Spirit that
appear'd to him in the Shape of a black Horse without an Head; to which
he added, that about a Month ago one of the Maids coming home late that
way with a Pail of Milk upon her Head, heard such a Rustling among the
Bushes that she let it fall.</p><p>I was taking a Walk in this Place last Night between the Hours of Nine
and Ten, and could not but <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec110.txt')">fancy</a> it one of the most proper Scenes in the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec110.txt')">World</a> for a Ghost to appear in. The Ruins of the Abby are scattered up
and down on every Side, and half covered with Ivy and Elder-Bushes, the
Harbours of several solitary Birds which seldom make their Appearance
till the Dusk of the Evening. The Place was formerly a Churchyard, and
has still several Marks in it of Graves and Burying-Places. There is
such an Eccho among the old Ruins and Vaults, that if you stamp but a
little louder than ordinary, you hear the Sound repeated. At the same
time the Walk of Elms, with the Croaking of the Ravens which from time
to time are heard from the Tops of them, looks exceeding solemn and
venerable. These <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec110.txt')">Objects</a> naturally raise Seriousness and Attention; and
when Night heightens the Awfulness of the Place, and pours out her
supernumerary Horrors upon every thing in it, I do not at all wonder
that weak Minds fill it with Spectres and Apparitions.</p><p>Mr. Locke, in his Chapter of the Association of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec110.txt')">Ideas</a>, has very curious
Remarks to shew how by the Prejudice of Education one Idea often
introduces into the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec110.txt')">Mind</a> a whole Set that bear no Resemblance to one
another in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec110.txt')">Nature</a> of things. Among several Examples of this Kind, he
produces the following Instance. _The Ideas of Goblins and Sprights have
really no more to do with Darkness than Light: Yet let but a foolish
Maid inculcate these often on the Mind of a Child, and raise them there
together, possibly he shall never be able to separate them again so long
as he lives; but Darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those
frightful Ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear
the one than the other. [2]</p><p>As I was walking in this Solitude, where the Dusk of the Evening
conspired with so many other Occasions of Terrour, I observed a Cow
grazing not far from me, which an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec110.txt')">Imagination</a> that is apt to _startle_,
might easily have construed into a black Horse without an Head: And I
dare say the poor Footman lost his Wits upon some such trivial Occasion.</p><p>My Friend Sir ROGER has often told me with a great deal of Mirth, that
at his first coming to his Estate he found three Parts of his House
altogether useless; that the best Room in it had the Reputation of being
haunted, and by that means was locked up; that Noises had been heard in
his long Gallery, so that he could not get a Servant to enter it after
eight a Clock at Night; that the Door of one of his Chambers was nailed
up, because there went a Story in the Family that a Butler had formerly
hang'd himself in it; and that his Mother, who lived to a great Age, had
shut up half the Rooms in the House, in which either her <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec110.txt')">Husband</a>, a Son,
or Daughter had died. The Knight seeing his Habitation reduced [to [3]]
so small a Compass, and himself in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec110.txt')">manner</a> shut out of his own House,
upon the Death of his Mother ordered [all the Apartments [4]] to be
flung open, and _exorcised_ by his Chaplain, who lay in every Room one
after another, and by that Means dissipated the Fears which had so long
reigned in the Family.</p><p>I should not have been thus particular upon these ridiculous Horrours,
did I not find them so very much prevail in all Parts of the <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec110.txt')">Country</a>. At
the same time I think a Person who is thus terrify'd with the
Imagination of Ghosts and Spectres much more reasonable than one who,
contrary to the Reports of all Historians sacred and prophane, ancient
and modern, and to the Traditions of all Nations, thinks the Appearance
of Spirits fabulous and groundless: Could not I give myself up to this
general Testimony of Mankind, I should to the Relations of particular
Persons who are now living, and whom I cannot distrust in other Matters
of Fact. I might here add, that not only the Historians, to whom we may
join the Poets, but likewise the Philosophers of Antiquity have favoured
this Opinion. _Lucretius_ himself, though by the Course of his
Philosophy he was obliged to maintain that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec110.txt')">Soul</a> did not exist
separate from the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec110.txt')">Body</a>, makes no Doubt of the Reality of Apparitions,
and that Men have often appeared after their Death. This I think very
remarkable; he was so pressed with the Matter of Fact which he could not
have the Confidence to deny, that he was forced to account for it by one
of the most absurd unphilosophical Notions that was ever started. He
tells us, That the Surfaces of all Bodies are perpetually flying off
from their respective Bodies, one after another; and that these Surfaces
or thin Cases that included each other whilst they were joined in the
Body like the Coats of an Onion, are sometimes seen entire when they are
separated from it; by which means we often behold the Shapes and Shadows
of Persons who are either dead or absent. [5]</p><p>I shall dismiss this Paper with a Story out of _Josephus_, not so much
for the sake of the Story it self as for the moral Reflections with
which the Author concludes it, and which I shall here set down in his
own Words.</p><p>'_Glaphyra_ the Daughter of King _Archelaus_, after the Death of her
two first <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec110.txt')">Husbands</a> (being <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec110.txt')">married</a> to a third, who was Brother to her
first Husband, and so passionately in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec110.txt')">love</a> with her that he turned off
his former <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec110.txt')">Wife</a> to make room for this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec110.txt')">Marriage</a>) had a very odd kind of
Dream. She fancied that she saw her first Husband coming towards her,
and that she embraced him with great Tenderness; when in the midst of
the Pleasure which she expressed at the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec110.txt')">Sight</a> of him, he reproached
her after the following manner: _Glaphyra_, says he, thou hast made
good the old Saying, That <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec110.txt')">Women</a> are not to be trusted. Was not I the
Husband of thy Virginity? Have I not Children by thee? How couldst
thou forget our Loves so far as to enter into a second Marriage, and
after that into a third, nay to take for thy Husband a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec110.txt')">Man</a> who has so
shamelessly crept into the Bed of his Brother? However, for the sake
of our passed Loves, I shall free thee from thy present Reproach, and
make thee mine for ever. _Glaphyra_ told this Dream to several Women
of her Acquaintance, and died soon after. [6] I thought this Story
might not be impertinent in this Place, wherein I <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec110.txt')">speak</a> of those
Kings: Besides that, the Example deserves to be taken notice of as it
contains a most certain Proof of the Immortality of the Soul, and of
Divine Providence. If any Man thinks these Facts incredible, let him
enjoy his own Opinion to himself, but let him not endeavour to disturb
the Belief of others, who by Instances of this Nature are excited to
the Study of Virtue.'</p><p>L.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Walk]</p><p>
