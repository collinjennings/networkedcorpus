<a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec128.txt')">Women</a> in their Nature are much more gay and joyous than Men; whether it
be that their Blood is more refined, their Fibres more delicate, and
their animal Spirits more light and volatile; or whether, as some have
imagined, there may not be a kind of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec128.txt')">Sex</a> in the very Soul, I shall not
pretend to determine. As Vivacity is the Gift of Women, Gravity is that
of Men. They should each of them therefore keep a Watch upon the
particular Biass which Nature has fixed in their Mind, that it may not
_draw_ too much, and lead them out of the Paths of Reason. This will
certainly happen, if the one in every <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec128.txt')">Word</a> and Action affects the
Character of being rigid and severe, and the other of being brisk and
airy. Men should beware of being captivated by a kind of savage
Philosophy, Women by a thoughtless Gallantry. Where these Precautions
are not observed, the Man often degenerates into a Cynick, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec128.txt')">Woman</a>
into a Coquet; the Man grows sullen and morose, the Woman impertinent
and fantastical.</p><p>By what I have said, we may conclude, Men and Women were made as
Counterparts to one another, that the Pains and Anxieties of the <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec128.txt')">Husband</a>
might be relieved by the Sprightliness and good Humour of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec128.txt')">Wife</a>. When
these are rightly tempered, <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec128.txt')">Care</a> and Chearfulness go Hand in Hand; and
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec128.txt')">Family</a>, like a Ship that is duly trimmed, wants neither Sail nor
Ballast.</p><p>Natural Historians observe, (for whilst I am in the Country I must fetch
my Allusions from thence) That only the Male Birds have Voices; That
their Songs begin a little before Breeding-time, and end a little after;
That whilst the Hen is covering her Eggs, the Male generally takes his
Stand upon a Neighbouring Bough within her Hearing; and by that means
amuses and diverts her with his Songs during the whole Time of her
Sitting.</p><p>This Contract among Birds lasts no longer than till a Brood of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec128.txt')">young</a>
ones arises from it; so that in the feather'd Kind, the Cares and
Fatigues of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec128.txt')">married</a> State, if I may so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec128.txt')">call</a> it, lie principally upon
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec128.txt')">Female</a>. On the contrary, as in our Species the Man and [the] Woman
are joined together for Life, and the main Burden rests upon the former,
Nature has given all the little Arts of Soothing and Blandishment to the
Female, that she may chear and animate her Companion in a constant and
assiduous Application to the making a Provision for his Family, and the
educating of their common <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec128.txt')">Children</a>. This however is not to be taken so
strictly, as if the same Duties were not often reciprocal, and incumbent
on both Parties; but only to set forth what seems to have been the
general Intention of Nature, in the different Inclinations and
Endowments which are bestowed on the different Sexes.</p><p>But whatever was the Reason that Man and Woman were made with this
Variety of Temper, if we observe the Conduct of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec128.txt')">Fair</a> Sex, we find
that they choose rather to associate themselves with a Person who
resembles them in that light and volatile Humour which is natural to
them, than to such as are qualified to moderate and counter-ballance it.
It has been an old Complaint, That the Coxcomb carries it with them
before the Man of Sense. When we see a Fellow loud and talkative, full
of insipid Life and Laughter, we may venture to pronounce him a female
Favourite: Noise and Flutter are such Accomplishments as they cannot
withstand. To be short, the Passion of an ordinary Woman for a Man is
nothing else but Self-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec128.txt')">love</a> diverted upon another Object: She would have
the Lover a Woman in every thing but the Sex. I do not know a finer
Piece of Satyr on this Part of Womankind, than those lines of
Mr._Dryden_,</p><p>'Our thoughtless Sex is caught by outward Form,
And empty Noise, and loves it self in Man.'</p><p>This is a Source of infinite Calamities to the Sex, as it frequently
joins them to Men, who in their own Thoughts are as fine Creatures as
themselves; or if they chance to be good-humoured, serve only to
dissipate their Fortunes, inflame their Follies, and aggravate their
Indiscretions.</p><p>The same female Levity is no less fatal to them after Mariage than
before: It represents to their Imaginations the faithful prudent Husband
as an honest tractable [and] domestick Animal; and turns their Thoughts
upon the fine gay Gentleman that laughs, sings, and dresses so much more
agreeably.</p><p>As this irregular Vivacity of Temper leads astray the Hearts of ordinary
Women in the Choice of their Lovers and the Treatment of their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec128.txt')">Husbands</a>,
it operates with the same pernicious Influence towards their Children,
who are taught to accomplish themselves in all those sublime Perfections
that appear captivating in the Eye of their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec128.txt')">Mother</a>. She admires in her
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec128.txt')">Son</a> what she loved in her Gallant; and by that means contributes all she
can to perpetuate herself in a worthless Progeny.</p><p>The younger _Faustina_ was a lively Instance of this sort of Women.
Notwithstanding she was married to _Marcus Aurelius_, one of the
greatest, wisest, and best of the _Roman_ Emperors, she thought a common
Gladiator much the prettier Gentleman; and had taken such Care to
accomplish her Son _Commodus_ according to her own Notions of a fine
Man, that when he ascended the Throne of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec128.txt')">Father</a>, he became the most
foolish and abandoned Tyrant that was ever placed at the Head of the
_Roman_ Empire, signalizing himself in nothing but the fighting of
Prizes, and knocking out Men's Brains. As he had no Taste of true Glory,
we see him in several Medals and Statues [which [1]] are still extant of
him, equipped like an _Hercules_ with a Club and a Lion's Skin.</p><p>I have been led into this Speculation by the Characters I have heard of
a Country Gentleman and his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec128.txt')">Lady</a>, who do not live many Miles from Sir
ROGER. The Wife is an old Coquet, that is always hankering after the
Diversions of the Town; the Husband a morose Rustick, that frowns and
frets at the Name of it. The Wife is overrun with Affectation, the
Husband sunk into Brutality: The Lady cannot bear the Noise of the Larks
and Nightingales, hates your tedious Summer Days, and is sick at the
Sight of shady Woods and purling Streams; the Husband wonders how any
one can be pleased with the Fooleries of Plays and Operas, and rails
from Morning to Night at essenced Fops and tawdry Courtiers. The
Children are educated in these different Notions of their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec128.txt')">Parents</a>. The
Sons follow the Father about his Grounds, while the Daughters read
Volumes of Love-Letters and Romances to their Mother. By this means it
comes to pass, that the Girls look upon their Father as a Clown, and the
Boys think their Mother no better than she should be.</p><p>How different are the Lives of _Aristus_ and _Aspasia_? the innocent
Vivacity of the one is tempered and composed by the chearful Gravity of
the other. The Wife grows wise by the Discourses of the Husband, and the
Husband good-humour'd by the Conversations of the Wife. _Aristus_ would
not be so amiable were it not for his _Aspasia_, nor _Aspasia_ so much
[esteemed [2]] were it not for her _Aristus_. Their Virtues are blended
in their Children, and diffuse through the whole Family a perpetual
Spirit of Benevolence, Complacency, and Satisfaction.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: that]</p><p>
