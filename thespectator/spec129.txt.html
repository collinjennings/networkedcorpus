<p>No. 129.                 Saturday, July 28, 1711.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Vertentem sese frustra sectabere canthum,
Cum rota posterior curras et in axe secundo.'</p><p>Pers.</p><p>
Great Masters in Painting never care for drawing <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec129.txt')">People</a> in the <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec129.txt')">Fashion</a>;
as very well knowing that the Headdress, or Periwig, that now prevails,
and gives a Grace to their Portraitures at <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec129.txt')">present</a>, will make a very odd
Figure, and perhaps look monstrous in the Eyes of Posterity. For this
Reason they often represent an illustrious Person in a _Roman_
Habit, or in some other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec129.txt')">Dress</a> that never varies. I could wish, for the
sake of my Country Friends, that there was such a kind of _everlasting
Drapery_ to be made use of by all who live at a certain distance from
the Town, and that they would agree upon such Fashions as should never
be liable to Changes and Innovations. For want of this _standing
Dress_, a Man [who [1]] takes a Journey into the Country is as much
surprised, as one [who [1]] walks in a Gallery of old Family Pictures;
and finds as great a Variety of Garbs and Habits in the Persons he
converses with. Did they keep to one constant Dress they would sometimes
be in the Fashion, which they never are as Matters are managed at
present. If instead of running after the Mode, they would continue fixed
in one certain Habit, the Mode would some time or other overtake them,
as a Clock that stands still is sure to point right once in twelve
Hours: In this Case therefore I would advise them, as a Gentleman did
his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec129.txt')">Friend</a> who was hunting about the whole Town after a rambling Fellow,
If you follow him you will never find him, but if you plant your self at
the Corner of any one Street, I'll engage it will not be long before you
see him.</p><p>I have already touched upon this Subject in a Speculation [which [1]]
shews how cruelly the Country are led astray in following the Town; and
equipped in a ridiculous Habit, when they fancy themselves in the Height
of the Mode. Since that Speculation I have received a Letter (which I
there hinted at) from a Gentleman who is now in the Western Circuit.</p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Being a Lawyer of the_ Middle-Temple_, [a [2]] _Cornishman_ by Birth,
I generally ride the Western Circuit for my health, and as I am not
interrupted with Clients, have leisure to make many Observations that
escape the Notice of my Fellow-Travellers.</p><p>One of the most fashionable <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec129.txt')">Women</a> I met with in all the Circuit was my
Landlady at _Stains_, where I chanced to be on a Holiday. Her Commode
was not half a Foot high, and her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec129.txt')">Petticoat</a> within some Yards of a
modish Circumference. In the same Place I observed a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec129.txt')">young</a> Fellow with
a tolerable Periwig, had it not been covered with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec129.txt')">Hat</a> that was
shaped in the _Ramillie_ Cock. [3] As I proceeded in my Journey I
observed the Petticoat grew scantier and scantier, and about
threescore Miles from _London_ was so very unfashionable, that a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec129.txt')">Woman</a>
might walk in it without any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec129.txt')">manner</a> of Inconvenience.</p><p>Not far from _Salisbury_ I took notice of a Justice of Peace's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec129.txt')">Lady</a>
[who [4]] was at least ten Years behindhand in her Dress, but at the
same time as fine as Hands could make her. She was flounced and
furbelowed from <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec129.txt')">Head</a> to Foot; every Ribbon was wrinkled, and every
Part of her Garments in Curl, so that she looked like one of those
Animals which in the Country we <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec129.txt')">call</a> a _Friezeland_ Hen.</p><p>Not many Miles beyond this Place I was informed that one of the last
Year's little Muffs had by some means or other straggled into those
Parts, and that all Women of Fashion were cutting their old Muffs in
two, or retrenching them, according to the little Model [which [5]]
was got among them. I cannot believe the Report they have there, that
it was sent down frank'd by a Parliament-man in a little Packet; but
probably by next Winter this Fashion will be at the Height in the
Country, when it is quite out at _London_.</p><p>The greatest Beau at our next Country Sessions was <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec129.txt')">dressed</a> in a most
monstrous Flaxen Periwig, that was made in King _William's_ Reign. The
Wearer of it goes, it seems, in his own Hair, when he is at home, and
lets his Wig lie in Buckle for a whole half Year, that he may put it
on upon Occasions to meet the Judges in it.</p><p>I must not here omit an Adventure [which [5]] happened to us in a
Country Church upon the Frontiers of _Cornwall_. As we were in the
midst of the Service, a Lady who is the chief Woman of the Place, and
had passed the Winter at _London_ with her Husband, entered the
Congregation in a little Headdress, and a hoop'd Petticoat. The
People, who were wonderfully startled at such a Sight, all of them
rose up. Some stared at the prodigious Bottom, and some at the little
Top of this strange Dress. In the mean time the Lady of the Manor
filled the [_Area_ [6]] of the Church, and walked up to her Pew with
an unspeakable Satisfaction, amidst the Whispers, Conjectures, and
Astonishments of the whole Congregation.</p><p>Upon our Way from hence we saw a young Fellow riding towards us full
Gallop, with a Bob Wig and a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec129.txt')">black</a> Silken Bag tied to it. He stopt
short at the Coach, to ask us how far the Judges were behind us. His
Stay was so very short, that we had only time to observe his new silk
Waistcoat, [which [7]] was unbutton'd in several Places to let us see
that he had a clean Shirt on, which was ruffled down to his middle.</p><p>From this Place, during our Progress through the most Western Parts of
the Kingdom, we fancied ourselves in King _Charles_ the Second's
Reign, the People having made very little Variations in their Dress
since that time. The smartest of the Country Squires appear still in
the _Monmouth_-Cock [8] and when they go a wooing (whether they have
any Post in the Militia or not) they generally put on a red <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec129.txt')">Coat</a>. We
were, indeed, very much surprized, at the Place we lay at last Night,
to meet with a Gentleman that had accoutered himself in a Night-Cap
Wig, a Coat with long Pockets, and slit Sleeves, and a pair of Shoes
with high Scollop Tops; but we soon found by his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec129.txt')">Conversation</a> that he
was a Person who laughed at the Ignorance and Rusticity of the Country
People, and was resolved to live and die in the Mode.</p><p>_Sir_, If you think this Account of my Travels may be of any Advantage
to the Publick, I will next Year trouble you with such Occurrences as
I shall meet with in other Parts of _England_. For I am informed there
are greater Curiosities in the Northern Circuit than in the Western;
and that a Fashion makes its Progress much slower into _Cumberland_
than into _Cornwall_. I have heard in particular, that the Steenkirk
[9] arrived but two Months ago at _Newcastle_, and that there are
several Commodes in those Parts which are worth taking a Journey
thither to see.</p><p>
