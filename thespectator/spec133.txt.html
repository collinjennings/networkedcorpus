<p>No. 133.               Thursday, August 2, 1711.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Quis Desiderio sit pudor aut modus
Tam Chari capitis?'</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
There is a sort of Delight, which is alternately mixed with Terror and
<a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec133.txt')">Sorrow</a>, in the Contemplation of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec133.txt')">Death</a>. The Soul has its Curiosity more
than ordinarily awakened, when it turns its Thoughts upon the Conduct of
such who have behaved themselves with an Equal, a Resigned, a Chearful,
a Generous or Heroick Temper in that Extremity.</p><p>We are affected with these respective Manners of <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec133.txt')">Behaviour</a>, as we
secretly believe the Part of the Dying Person imitable by our selves, or
such as we imagine our selves more particularly capable of.</p><p>Men of exalted Minds march before us like Princes, and are, to the
Ordinary Race of Mankind, rather Subjects for their Admiration than
Example. However, there are no Ideas strike more forcibly upon our
Imaginations; than those which are raised from Reflections upon the
Exits of <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec133.txt')">great</a> and excellent Men. Innocent Men who have suffered as
Criminals, tho' they were Benefactors to Human Society, seem to be
Persons of the highest Distinction, among the vastly greater Number of
Human Race, the Dead. When the Iniquity of the Times brought _Socrates_
to his Execution, how great and wonderful is it to behold him,
unsupported by any thing but the Testimony of his own Conscience and
Conjectures of Hereafter, receive the Poison with an Air of Mirth and
good Humour, and as if going on an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec133.txt')">agreeable</a> Journey bespeak some Deity
to make it fortunate.</p><p>When _Phocion's_ good Actions had met with the like Reward from his
Country, and he was led to Death with many others of his Friends, they
bewailing their Fate, he walking composedly towards the Place of
Execution, how gracefully does he support his Illustrious Character to
the very last Instant. One of the Rabble spitting at him as he passed,
with his usual Authority he called to know if no one was ready to teach
this Fellow how to behave himself. When a Poor-spirited Creature that
died at the same time for his Crimes bemoaned himself unmanfully, he
rebuked him with this Question, Is it no Consolation to such a Man as
thou art to die with _Phocion?_ At the Instant when he was to die, they
asked him what commands he had for his Son, he answered, To forget this
Injury of the _Athenians. Niocles_, his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec133.txt')">Friend</a>, under the same Sentence,
desired he might drink the Potion before him: _Phocion_ said, because he
never had denied him any thing he would not even this, the most
difficult Request he had ever made.</p><p>These Instances [1] were very noble and great, and the Reflections of
those Sublime Spirits had made Death to them what it is really intended
to be by the Author of Nature, a Relief from a various Being ever
subject to Sorrows and Difficulties.</p><p>_Epaminondas_, the _Theban_ General, having received in Fight a mortal
Stab with a Sword, which was left in his Body, lay in that Posture 'till
he had Intelligence that his Troops [had] obtained the Victory, and then
permitted it to be drawn [out], at which Instant he expressed himself in
this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec133.txt')">manner</a>,</p><p>_This is not the end of my Life, my Fellow-Soldiers; it is now your_
Epaminondas _is born, who dies in so much <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec133.txt')">Glory</a>_.</p><p>It were an endless Labour to collect the Accounts with which all Ages
have filled the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec133.txt')">World</a> of Noble and Heroick Minds that have resigned this
Being, as if the Termination of Life were but an ordinary Occurrence of
it.</p><p>This common-place way of Thinking I fell into from an awkward Endeavour
to throw off a real and fresh <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec133.txt')">Affliction</a>, by turning over Books in a
melancholy Mood; but it is not easy to remove Griefs which touch the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec133.txt')">Heart</a>, by applying Remedies which only entertain the Imagination. As
therefore this Paper is to consist of any thing which concerns Human
Life, I cannot help letting the present Subject regard what has been the
last Object of my Eyes, tho' an Entertainment of Sorrow.</p><p>I went this Evening to visit a Friend, with a design to rally him, upon
a Story I had heard of his intending to steal a Marriage without the
Privity of us his intimate Friends and Acquaintance. I came into his
Apartment with that Intimacy which I have done for very many Years, and
walked directly into his Bed-chamber, where I found my Friend in the
Agonies of Death. [2] What could I do? The innocent Mirth in my Thoughts
struck upon me like the most flagitious Wickedness: I in vain called
upon him; he was senseless, and too far spent to have the least
Knowledge of my Sorrow, or any Pain in himself. Give me leave then to
transcribe my Soliloquy, as I stood by his Mother, dumb with the weight
of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec133.txt')">Grief</a> for a Son who was her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec133.txt')">Honour</a> and her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec133.txt')">Comfort</a>, and never till
that Hour since his Birth had been an Occasion of a Moment's Sorrow to
her.</p><p>'How surprising is this Change! from the Possession of vigorous Life
and Strength, to be reduced in a few Hours to this fatal Extremity!
Those Lips which look so pale and livid, within these few Days gave
Delight to all who heard their Utterance: It was the Business, the
Purpose of his Being, next to Obeying him to whom he is going, to
please and instruct, and that for no other end but to please and
instruct. Kindness was the Motive of his Actions, and with all the
Capacity requisite for making a Figure in a contentious World,
Moderation, Good-Nature, Affability, Temperance and Chastity, were the
Arts of his Excellent Life. There as he lies in helpless Agony, no
Wise Man who knew him so well as I, but would resign all the World can
bestow to be so near the end of such a Life. Why does my Heart so
little obey my Reason as to lament thee, thou excellent Man. ...
Heaven receive him, or restore him ... Thy beloved Mother, thy obliged
Friends, thy helpless Servants, stand around thee without Distinction.
How much wouldst thou, hadst thou thy Senses, say to each of us.</p><p>But now that good Heart bursts, and he is at rest--with that Breath
expired a Soul who never indulged a Passion unfit for the Place he is
gone to: Where are now thy Plans of Justice, of Truth, of Honour? Of
what use the Volumes thou hast collated, the Arguments thou hast
invented, the Examples thou hast followed. Poor were the Expectations
of the Studious, the Modest and the Good, if the Reward of their
Labours were only to be expected from Man. No, my Friend, thy intended
Pleadings, thy intended good Offices to thy Friends, thy intended
Services to thy Country, are already performed (as to thy Concern in
them) in his Sight before whom the Past, Present, and Future appear at
one View. While others with thy Talents were tormented with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec133.txt')">Ambition</a>,
with Vain-glory, with Envy, with Emulation, how well didst thou turn
thy Mind to its own Improvement in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec133.txt')">things</a> out of the Power of Fortune,
in Probity, in Integrity, in the Practice and Study of Justice; how
silent thy Passage, how private thy Journey, how glorious thy End!
_Many have I known more Famous, some more Knowing, not one so
Innocent_.'</p><p>R.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: From Plutarch's 'Life of Phocion'.]</p><p>
