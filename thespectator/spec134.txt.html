<p>No. 134.                  Friday, August 3, 1711.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>'... Opiferque per Orbem
Dicor ...'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p>
During my Absence in the Country, several Packets have been left for me,
which were not forwarded to me, because I was expected every Day in
Town. The Author of the following Letter, dated from _Tower-Hill_,
having sometimes been entertained with some Learned Gentlemen in Plush
Doublets, who have vended their Wares from a Stage in that Place, has
pleasantly enough addressed Me, as no less a Sage in Morality, than
those are in Physick. To comply with his kind Inclination to make my
Cures famous, I shall give you his Testimonial of my great Abilities at
large in his own Words.</p><p>
_SIR_,</p><p>'Your saying t'other Day there is something wonderful in the
Narrowness of those Minds which can be pleased, and be barren of
Bounty to those who please them, makes me in pain that I am not a Man
of Power: If I were, you should soon see how much I approve your
Speculations. In the mean time, I beg leave to supply that Inability
with the empty Tribute of an honest Mind, by telling you plainly I
love and thank you for your daily Refreshments. I constantly peruse
your Paper as I smoke my Morning's Pipe, (tho' I can't forbear reading
the Motto before I fill and light) and really it gives a grateful
Relish to every Whif; each Paragraph is freight either with useful or
delightful Notions, and I never fail of being highly diverted or
improved. The Variety of your Subjects surprizes me as much as a Box
of Pictures did formerly, in which there was only one Face, that by
pulling some Pieces of Isinglass over it, was changed into a grave
Senator or a _Merry Andrew_, a patch'd <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec134.txt')">Lady</a> or a Nun, a Beau or a
Black-a-moor, a Prude or a Coquet, a Country 'Squire or a Conjurer,
with many other different Representations very entertaining (as you
are) tho' still the same at the Bottom. This was a childish Amusement
when I was carried away with outward Appearance, but you make a deeper
Impression, and affect the secret Springs of the Mind; you charm the
Fancy, sooth the Passions, and insensibly lead the Reader to that
Sweetness of Temper that you so well describe; you rouse Generosity
with that Spirit, and inculcate Humanity with that Ease, that he must
be miserably Stupid that is not affected by you. I can't say indeed
that you have put Impertinence to Silence, or Vanity out of
Countenance; but methinks you have bid as <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec134.txt')">fair</a> for it, as any Man that
ever appeared upon a publick Stage; and offer an infallible Cure of
Vice and Folly, for the Price of One Penny. And since it is usual for
those who receive Benefit by such famous Operators, to publish an
Advertisement, that others may reap the same Advantage, I think my
self obliged to declare to all the World, that having for a long time
been splenatick, ill natured, froward, suspicious, and unsociable, by
the Application of your Medicines, taken only with half an Ounce of
right _Virginia_ Tobacco, for six successive Mornings, I am become
open, obliging, officious, frank, and hospitable.</p><p>_I am, Your Humble Servant, and great Admirer_,</p><p>George Trusty.</p><p>Tower-hill,</p><p>July 5, 1711.</p><p>
This careful Father and humble Petitioner hereafter mentioned, who are
under Difficulties about the just Management of Fans, will soon receive
proper Advertisements relating to the Professors in that behalf, with
their Places of Abode and Methods of Teaching.</p><p>
July the 5th, 1711.</p><p>SIR,</p><p>'In your Spectator of _June_ the 7th you Transcribe a Letter sent to
you from a new sort of Muster-<a name="topic23" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec134.txt')">master</a>, who teaches <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec134.txt')">Ladies</a> the whole
Exercise of the Fan; I have a Daughter just come to Town, who tho' she
has always held a Fan in her Hand at proper Times, yet she knows no
more how to use it according to true Discipline, than an awkward
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec134.txt')">School</a>-boy does to make use of his new Sword: I have sent for her on
purpose to learn the Exercise, she being already very well
accomplished in all other Arts which are necessary for a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec134.txt')">young</a> Lady to
understand; my Request is, that you will <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec134.txt')">speak</a> to your Correspondent
on my behalf, and in your next Paper let me know what he expects,
either by the Month, or the Quarter, for teaching; and where he keeps
his Place of Rendezvous. I have a Son too, whom I would fain have
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec134.txt')">taught</a> to gallant Fans, and should be glad to know what the Gentleman
will have for teaching them both, I finding Fans for Practice at my
own Expence. This Information will in the highest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec134.txt')">manner</a> oblige,</p><p>_SIR, Your most humble Servant_,</p><p>William Wiseacre.</p><p>As soon as my Son is perfect in this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec134.txt')">Art</a> (which I hope will be in a
Year's time, for the Boy is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec134.txt')">pretty</a> apt,) I design he shall learn to
ride the great Horse, (altho' he is not yet above twenty Years old) if
his Mother, whose Darling he is, will venture him.</p><p>
_To the_ SPECTATOR.</p><p>_The humble Petition of_ Benjamin Easie, _Gent_.</p><p>_Sheweth_,</p><p>'That it was your Petitioner's Misfortune to walk to _Hackney_ Church
last Sunday, where to his great Amazement he met with a Soldier of
your own training: she furls a Fan, recovers a Fan, and goes through
the whole Exercise of it to Admiration. This well-managed Officer of
yours has, to my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec134.txt')">Knowledge</a>, been the Ruin of above five young
Gentlemen besides my self, and still goes on laying waste wheresoever
she comes, whereby the whole Village is in great danger. Our humble
Request is therefore that this bold Amazon be ordered immediately to
lay down her Arms, or that you would issue forth an Order, that we who
have been thus injured may meet at the Place of General Rendezvous,
and there be taught to manage our Snuff-Boxes in such manner as we may
be an equal Match for her:</p><p>_And your Petitioner shall ever Pray_, &c.</p><p>
R.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
