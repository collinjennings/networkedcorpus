I am very much at a loss to express by any <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec157.txt')">Word</a> that occurs to me in our
Language that which is understood by _Indoles_ in _Latin_. The natural
Disposition to any Particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec157.txt')">Art</a>, Science, Profession, or Trade, is
very much to be consulted in the Care of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec157.txt')">Youth</a>, and studied by Men for
their own Conduct when they form to themselves any Scheme of Life. It is
wonderfully hard indeed for a Man to judge of his own Capacity
impartially; that may look <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec157.txt')">great</a> to me which may appear little to
another, and I may be carried by Fondness towards my self so far, as to
attempt <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec157.txt')">Things</a> too high for my Talents and Accomplishments: But it is
not methinks so very difficult a Matter to make a Judgment of the
Abilities of others, especially of those who are in their Infancy. My
Commonplace Book directs me on this Occasion to mention the Dawning of
Greatness in _Alexander_, who being asked in his Youth to contend for a
Prize in the Olympick Games, answered he would, if he had Kings to run
against him. _Cassius_, who was one of the Conspirators against _Cæsar_,
gave as great a Proof of his Temper, when in his Childhood he struck a
Play-fellow, the Son of _Sylla_, for saying his Father was <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec157.txt')">Master</a> of the
_Roman_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec157.txt')">People</a>. _Scipio_ is reported to have answered, (when some
Flatterers at Supper were asking him what the _Romans_ should do for a
General after his <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec157.txt')">Death</a>) Take _Marius_. _Marius_ was then a very Boy,
and had given no Instances of his Valour; but it was visible to _Scipio_
from the Manners of the Youth, that he had a Soul formed for the Attempt
and Execution of great Undertakings. I must confess I have very often
with much <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec157.txt')">Sorrow</a> bewailed the Misfortune of the Children of _Great
Britain_, when I consider the Ignorance and Undiscerning of the
Generality of Schoolmasters. The boasted Liberty we talk of is but a
mean Reward for the long Servitude, the many <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec157.txt')">Heart</a>-aches and Terrors, to
which our Childhood is exposed in going through a Grammar-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec157.txt')">School</a>: Many
of these stupid Tyrants exercise their Cruelty without any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec157.txt')">manner</a> of
Distinction of the Capacities of Children, or the Intention of Parents
in their Behalf. There are many excellent Tempers which are <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec157.txt')">worthy</a> to be
nourished and cultivated with all possible Diligence and Care, that were
never designed to be acquainted with _Aristotle, Tully_, or _Virgil_;
and there are as many who have Capacities for understanding every Word
those great Persons have writ, and yet were not born to have any Relish
of their Writings. For want of this common and obvious discerning in
those who have the Care of Youth, we have so many hundred unaccountable
Creatures every Age whipped up into great Scholars, that are for ever
near a right Understanding, and will never arrive at it. These are the
Scandal of Letters, and these are generally the Men who are to teach
others. The Sense of Shame and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec157.txt')">Honour</a> is enough to keep the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec157.txt')">World</a> itself
in Order without Corporal Punishment, much more to train the Minds of
uncorrupted and innocent Children. It happens, I doubt not, more than
once in a Year, that a Lad is chastised for a Blockhead, when it is good
Apprehension that makes him incapable of knowing what his Teacher means:
A brisk Imagination very often may suggest an Error, which a Lad could
not have fallen into, if he had been as heavy in conjecturing as his
Master in explaining: But there is no Mercy even towards a wrong
Interpretation of his Meaning, the Sufferings of the Scholar's Body are
to rectify the Mistakes of his Mind.</p><p>I am confident that no Boy who will not be allured to Letters without
Blows, will ever be brought to any thing with them. A great or good Mind
must necessarily be the worse for such Indignities; and it is a sad
Change to lose of its Virtue for the Improvement of its <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec157.txt')">Knowledge</a>. No
one who has gone through what they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec157.txt')">call</a> a great School, but must
remember to have seen Children of excellent and ingenuous Natures, (as
has afterwards appeared in their Manhood) I say no Man has passed
through this way of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec157.txt')">Education</a>, but must have seen an ingenuous Creature
expiring with Shame, with pale Looks, beseeching Sorrow, and silent
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec157.txt')">Tears</a>, throw up its honest Eyes, and kneel on its tender Knees to an
inexorable Blockhead, to be forgiven the false Quantity of a Word in
making a Latin Verse; The Child is punished, and the next Day he commits
a like Crime, and so a third with the same Consequence. I would fain ask
any reasonable Man whether this Lad, in the Simplicity of his native
Innocence, full of Shame, and capable of any Impression from that Grace
of Soul, was not fitter for any Purpose in this Life, than after that
Spark of Virtue is extinguished in him, tho' he is able to write twenty
Verses in an Evening?</p><p>Seneca says, after his exalted way of Talking, _As the immortal Gods
never learnt any Virtue, tho they are endowed with all that is good; so
there are some Men who have so natural a Propensity to what they should
follow, that they learn it almost as soon as they hear it._ [1] Plants
and Vegetables are cultivated into the Production of finer Fruit than
they would yield without that Care; and yet we cannot entertain Hopes of
producing a tender conscious Spirit into Acts of Virtue, without the
same Methods as is used to cut Timber, or give new Shape to a Piece of
Stone.</p><p>It is wholly to this dreadful Practice that we may attribute a certain
Hardiness and Ferocity which some Men, tho' liberally educated, carry
about them in all their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec157.txt')">Behaviour</a>. To be bred like a Gentleman, and
punished like a Malefactor, must, as we see it does, produce that
illiberal Sauciness which we see sometimes in Men of Letters.</p><p>The  _Spartan_ Boy who suffered the Fox (which he had stolen and hid
under his Coat) to eat into his Bowels, I dare say had not half the Wit
or Petulance which we learn at great Schools among us: But the glorious
Sense of Honour, or rather <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec157.txt')">Fear</a> of Shame, which he demonstrated in that
Action, was worth all the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec157.txt')">Learning</a> in the World without it.</p><p>It is methinks a very melancholy Consideration, that a little Negligence
can spoil us, but great Industry is necessary to improve us; the most
excellent Natures are soon depreciated, but evil Tempers are long before
they are exalted into good Habits. To help this by Punishments, is the
same thing as killing a Man to cure him of a Distemper; when he comes to
suffer Punishment in that one Circumstance, he is brought below the
Existence of a rational Creature, and is in the State of a Brute that
moves only by the Admonition of Stripes. But since this Custom of
educating by the Lash is suffered by the Gentry of  _Great Britain _, I
would prevail only that honest heavy Lads may be dismissed from Slavery
sooner than they are at present, and not whipped on to their fourteenth
or fifteenth Year, whether they expect any Progress from them or not.
Let the Child's Capacity be forthwith examined and [he] sent to some
Mechanick Way of Life, without <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec157.txt')">respect</a> to his Birth, if Nature designed
him for nothing higher: let him go before he has innocently suffered,
and is debased into a Dereliction of Mind for being what it is no Guilt
to be, a plain Man. I would not here be supposed to have said, that our
learned Men of either Robe who have been whipped at School, are not
still Men of noble and liberal Minds; but I am sure they had been much
more so than they are, had they never suffered that Infamy.</p><p>But tho' there is so little Care, as I have observed, taken, or
Observation made of the natural Strain of Men, it is no small <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec157.txt')">Comfort</a> to
me, as a SPECTATOR, that there is any right Value set upon the  _bona
Indoles_ of other Animals; as appears by the following Advertisement
handed about the County of  _Lincoln _, and subscribed by  _Enos Thomas_,
a Person whom I have not the Honour to know, but suppose to be
profoundly learned in Horse-flesh.</p><p>_A Chesnut Horse called_ Cæsar,  _bred_ by James Darcy, _Esq., at_
Sedbury,  _near_ Richmond  _in the County of_ York;  _his Grandam
was his old royal Mare, and got by_ Blunderbuss,  _which was got by_
Hemsly Turk,  _and he got Mr._ Courand's Arabian,  _which got Mr._
Minshul's Jews-trump.  _Mr._ Cæsar  _sold him to a Nobleman
(coming five Years old, when he had but one Sweat) for three hundred
Guineas. A Guinea a Leap and Trial, and a Shilling the Man_.</p><p>T. Enos Thomas.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1:  Epist. 95.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *      *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
