<p>No. 158.                 Friday, August 31, 1711.             Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Nos hoec novimus esse nihil.'</p><p>Martial.</p><p>
Out of a firm Regard to Impartiality, I print these Letters, let them
make for me or not.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I have observed through the whole Course of your Rhapsodies, (as you
once very well called them) you are very industrious to overthrow all
that many your Superiors who have gone before you have made their Rule
of writing. I am now between fifty and sixty, and had the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec158.txt')">Honour</a> to be
well with the first Men of Taste and Gallantry in the joyous Reign of
_Charles_ the Second: We then had, I humbly presume, as good
Understandings among us as any now can pretend to. As for yourself,
_Mr_. SPECTATOR, you seem with the utmost Arrogance to undermine the
very Fundamentals upon which we conducted our selves. It is monstrous
to set up for a Man of Wit, and yet deny that Honour in a <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec158.txt')">Woman</a> is any
thing else but Peevishness, that Inclination [is [1]] the best Rule of
Life, or Virtue and Vice any thing else but Health and Disease. We had
no more to do but to put a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec158.txt')">Lady</a> into good Humour, and all we could
wish followed of Course. Then again, your _Tully_, and your Discourses
of another Life, are the very Bane of Mirth and good Humour. Pr'ythee
don't value thyself on thy Reason at that exorbitant Rate, and the
Dignity of human Nature; take my <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec158.txt')">Word</a> for it, a Setting-dog has as
good Reason as any Man in _England_. Had you (as by your Diurnals one
would think you do) set up for being in vogue in Town, you should have
fallen in with the Bent of Passion and Appetite; your Songs had then
been in every <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec158.txt')">pretty</a> Mouth in _England_, and your little Distichs had
been the Maxims of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec158.txt')">Fair</a> and the Witty to walk by: But alas, Sir,
what can you hope for from entertaining <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec158.txt')">People</a> with what must needs
make them like themselves worse than they did before they read you?
Had you made it your Business to describe _Corinna_ charming, though
inconstant, to find something in human Nature itself to make _Zoilus_
excuse himself for being fond of her; and to make every Man in good
Commerce with his own Reflections, you had done something <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec158.txt')">worthy</a> our
Applause; but indeed, Sir, we shall not commend you for disapproving
us. I have a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec158.txt')">great</a> deal more to say to you, but I shall sum it up all
in this one Remark, In short, Sir, you do not write like a Gentleman.</p><p>'I am, SIR,
Your most humble Servant.'</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'The other Day we were several of us at a Tea-Table, and according to
Custom and your own Advice had the _Spectator_ read among us: It was
that Paper wherein you are pleased to treat with great Freedom that
Character which you <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec158.txt')">call</a> a Woman's Man. We gave up all the Kinds you
have mentioned, except those who, you say, are our constant Visitants.
I was upon the Occasion commissioned by the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec158.txt')">Company</a> to write to you
and tell you, That we shall not part with the Men we have at present,
'till the Men of Sense think fit to relieve them, and give us their
Company in their Stead. You cannot imagine but that we love to hear
Reason and good Sense better than the Ribaldry we are at present
entertained with, but we must have Company, and among us very
inconsiderable is better than none at all. We are made for the Cements
of Society, and came into the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec158.txt')">World</a> to create Relations among Mankind;
and Solitude is an unnatural Being to us. If the Men of good
Understanding would forget a little of their Severity, they would find
their Account in it; and their Wisdom would have a Pleasure in it, to
which they are now Strangers. It is natural among us when Men have a
true Relish of our Company and our Value, to say every thing with a
better Grace; and there is without designing it something ornamental
in what Men utter before <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec158.txt')">Women</a>, which is lost or neglected in
Conversations of Men only. Give me leave to tell you, Sir, it would do
you no great Harm if you yourself came a little more into our Company;
it would certainly cure you of a certain positive and determining
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec158.txt')">Manner</a> in which you talk sometimes. In hopes of your Amendment,</p><p>'I am, SIR,</p><p>'Your gentle Reader_.'</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Your professed Regard to the Fair <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec158.txt')">Sex</a>, may perhaps make them value
your Admonitions when they will not those of other Men. I desire you,
Sir, to repeat some Lectures upon Subjects which you have now and then
in a cursory manner only just touched. I would have a _Spectator_
wholly writ upon good Breeding: and after you have asserted that Time
and Place are to be very much considered in all our Actions, it will
be proper to dwell upon <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec158.txt')">Behaviour</a> at Church. On Sunday last a grave
and reverend Man preached at our Church: There was something
particular in his Accent, but without any manner of Affectation. This
Particularity a Set of Gigglers thought the most necessary Thing to be
taken notice of in his whole Discourse, and made it an Occasion of
Mirth during the whole time of Sermon: You should see one of them
ready to burst behind a Fan, another pointing to a Companion in
another Seat, and a fourth with an arch Composure, as if she would if
possible stifle her Laughter. There were many Gentlemen who looked at
them stedfastly, but this they took for ogling and admiring them:
There was one of the merry ones in particular, that found out but just
then that she had but five Fingers, for she fell a reckoning the
pretty Pieces of Ivory over and over again, to find her self
Employment and not laugh out. Would it not be expedient, Mr.
SPECTATOR, that the Church-warden should hold up his Wand on these
Occasions, and keep the Decency of the Place as a Magistrate does the
Peace in a Tumult elsewhere?</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a Woman's Man, and read with a very fine Lady your Paper, wherein
you fall upon us whom you envy: What do you think I did? you must know
she was dressing, I read the _Spectator_ to her, and she laughed at
the Places where she thought I was touched; I threw away your Moral,
and taking up her Girdle cried out,</p><p>_Give me but what this Ribbon bound,
Take all the rest the [Sun [2]] goes round_. [3]</p><p>She smiled, Sir, and said you were a Pedant; so say of me what you
please, read _Seneca_ and quote him against me if you think fit.
_I am_,
_SIR,
Your humble Servant_.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: is not]</p><p>
