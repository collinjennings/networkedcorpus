<p>No. 166.                Monday, September 10, 1711.             Addison.</p><p></p><p>'... Quod nec Jovis ira, nec ignis,
Nec poterit ferrum, nec edax abolere vetustas.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p>
Aristotle tells us that the <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec166.txt')">World</a> is a Copy or Transcript of those <a name="topic21" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec166.txt')">Ideas</a>
which are in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec166.txt')">Mind</a> of the first Being, and that those Ideas, which
are in the Mind of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec166.txt')">Man</a>, are a Transcript of the World: To this we may
add, that <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec166.txt')">Words</a> are the Transcript of those Ideas which are in the Mind
of Man, and that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec166.txt')">Writing</a> or Printing are the Transcript of words.</p><p>As the Supreme Being has expressed, and as it were printed his Ideas in
the Creation, Men express their Ideas in Books, which by this great
Invention of these latter Ages may last as long as the Sun and Moon, and
perish only in the general Wreck of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec166.txt')">Nature</a>. Thus _Cowley_ in his Poem on
the Resurrection, mentioning the Destruction of the Universe, has those
admirable Lines.</p><p>'_Now all the wide extended Sky,
And all th' harmonious Worlds on high,
And_ Virgil's _sacred Work shall die_.'</p><p>There is no other Method of fixing those Thoughts which arise and
disappear in the Mind of Man, and transmitting them to the last Periods
of Time; no other Method of giving a Permanency to our Ideas, and
preserving the Knowledge of any particular Person, when his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec166.txt')">Body</a> is
mixed with the common Mass of Matter, and his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec166.txt')">Soul</a> retired into the
World of Spirits. Books are the Legacies that a great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec166.txt')">Genius</a> leaves to
Mankind, which are delivered down from Generation to Generation, as
Presents to the Posterity of those who are yet unborn.</p><p>All other Arts of perpetuating our Ideas continue but a short Time:
Statues can last but a few Thousands of Years, Edifices fewer, and
Colours still fewer than Edifices. _Michael Angelo_, _Fontana_, and
_Raphael_, will hereafter be what _Phidias_, _Vitruvius_, and _Apelles_
are at present; the Names of great Statuaries, Architects and Painters,
whose <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec166.txt')">Works</a> are lost. The several Arts are expressed in mouldring
Materials: Nature sinks under them, and is not able to support the Ideas
which are imprest upon it.</p><p>The Circumstance which gives <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec166.txt')">Authors</a> an Advantage above all these great
Masters, is this, that they can multiply their Originals; or rather can
make Copies of their Works, to what Number they please, which shall be
as valuable as the Originals themselves. This gives a great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec166.txt')">Author</a>
something like a Prospect of Eternity, but at the same time deprives him
of those other Advantages which Artists meet with. The Artist finds
greater Returns in Profit, as the Author in Fame. What an Inestimable
Price would a _Virgil_ or a _Homer_, a _Cicero_ or an _Aristotle_ bear,
were their Works like a Statue, a Building, or a Picture, to be confined
only in one Place and made the Property of a single Person?</p><p>If Writings are thus durable, and may pass from Age to Age throughout
the whole Course of Time, how careful should an Author be of committing
any thing to Print that may corrupt Posterity, and poison the Minds of
Men with Vice and Error? <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec166.txt')">Writers</a> of great Talents, who employ their
Parts in propagating Immorality, and seasoning vicious Sentiments with
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec166.txt')">Wit</a> and Humour, are to be looked upon as the Pests of Society, and the
Enemies of Mankind: They leave Books behind them (as it is said of those
who die in Distempers which breed an Ill-will towards their own Species)
to scatter Infection and destroy their Posterity. They act the
Counterparts of a _Confucius_ or a _Socrates_; and seem to have been
sent into the World to deprave <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec166.txt')">human</a> Nature, and sink it into the
Condition of Brutality.</p><p>I have seen some Roman-Catholick Authors, who tell us that vicious
Writers continue in Purgatory so long as the Influence of their Writings
continues upon Posterity: For Purgatory, say they, is nothing else but a
cleansing us of our Sins, which cannot be said to be done away, so long
as they continue to operate and corrupt Mankind. The vicious Author, say
they, sins after <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec166.txt')">Death</a>, and so long as he continues to sin, so long must
he expect to be punished. Tho' the Roman Catholick Notion of Purgatory
be indeed very ridiculous, one cannot but think that if the Soul after
Death has any Knowledge of what passes in this World, that of an immoral
Writer would receive much more Regret from the Sense of corrupting, than
Satisfaction from the Thought of pleasing his surviving Admirers.</p><p>To take off from the Severity of this Speculation, I shall conclude this
Paper with a Story of an Atheistical Author, who at a time when he lay
dangerously sick, and desired the Assistance of a neighbouring Curate,
confessed to him with great Contrition, that nothing sat more heavy at
his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec166.txt')">Heart</a> than the Sense of his having seduced the Age by his Writings,
and that their evil Influence was likely to continue even after his
Death. The Curate upon further Examination finding the Penitent in the
utmost Agonies of Despair, and being himself a Man of Learning, told
him, that he hoped his Case was not so desperate as he apprehended,
since he found that he was so very sensible of his Fault, and so
sincerely repented of it. The Penitent still urged the evil Tendency of
his Book to subvert all Religion, and the little Ground of Hope there
could be for one whose Writings would continue to do Mischief when his
Body was laid in Ashes. The Curate, finding no other Way to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec166.txt')">comfort</a> him,
told him, that he did well in being afflicted for the evil Design with
which he published his Book; but that he ought to be very thankful that
there was no danger of its doing any Hurt: That his Cause was so very
bad, and his Arguments so weak, that he did not apprehend any ill
Effects of it: In short, that he might rest satisfied his Book could do
no more Mischief after his Death, than it had done whilst he was living.
To which he added, for his farther Satisfaction, that he did not believe
any besides his particular Friends and Acquaintance had ever been at the
pains of reading it, or that any Body after his Death would ever enquire
after it. The dying Man had still so much the Frailty of an Author in
him, as to be cut to the Heart with these Consolations; and without
answering the good Man, asked his Friends about him (with a Peevishness
that is natural to a sick Person) where they had picked up such a
Blockhead? And whether they thought him a proper Person to attend one in
his Condition? The Curate finding that the Author did not expect to be
dealt with as a real and sincere Penitent, but as a Penitent of
Importance, after a short Admonition withdrew; not questioning but he
should be again sent for if the Sickness grew desperate. The Author
however recovered, and has since written two or three other Tracts with
the same Spirit, and very luckily for his poor Soul with the same
Success.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
