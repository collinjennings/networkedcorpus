<p>No. 168.              Wednesday, September 12, 1711.            Steele.</p><p></p><p>'... _Pectus Præceptis format amicis_.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
It would be Arrogance to neglect the Application of my Correspondents so
far as not sometimes to insert their Animadversions upon my Paper; that
of this Day shall be therefore wholly composed of the Hints which they
have sent me.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I Send you this to congratulate your late Choice of a Subject, for
treating on which you deserve publick Thanks; I mean that on those
licensed Tyrants the Schoolmasters. If you can disarm them of their
Rods, you will certainly have your old Age reverenced by all the young
Gentlemen of _<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec168.txt')">Great</a>-Britain_ who are now between seven and seventeen
Years. You may boast that the incomparably wise _Quintilian_ and you
are of one Mind in this Particular.</p><p>'_Si cui est_ (says he) _mens tam illiberalis ut objurgatione non
corrigatur, is etiam ad plagas, ut pessimo quæque mancipia,
durabitur. [1]</p><p>If any Child be of so disingenuous a Nature, as not to stand
corrected by Reproof, he, like the very worst of Slaves, will be
hardned even against Blows themselves.'</p><p>And afterwards,</p><p>'Pudet dicere in quæ probra nefandi homines isto cædendi jure
abutantur_,</p><p>i. e. _I blush to say how shamefully those wicked Men abuse the
Power of Correction_.'</p><p>I was bred myself, Sir, in a very great <a name="topic23" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec168.txt')">School</a>, of which the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec168.txt')">Master</a>
was a _Welchman_, but certainly descended from a _Spanish_ Family, as
plainly appeared from his Temper as well as his Name. [2] I leave you
to judge what sort of a Schoolmaster a _Welchman_ ingrafted on a
_Spaniard_ would make. So very dreadful had he made himself to me,
that altho' it is above twenty Years since I felt his heavy Hand, yet
still once a Month at least I dream of him, so strong an Impression
did he make on my Mind. 'Tis a Sign he has fully terrified me waking,
who still continues to haunt me sleeping.</p><p>And yet I may say without Vanity, that the Business of the School was
what I did without great Difficulty; and I was not remarkably unlucky;
and yet such was the Master's Severity that once a Month, or oftner, I
suffered as much as would have satisfied the Law of the Land for a
_Petty Larceny_.</p><p>Many a white and tender Hand, which the fond Mother has passionately
kissed a thousand and a thousand times, have I seen whipped till it
was covered with Blood: perhaps for smiling, or for going a Yard and
half out of a Gate, or for writing an O for an A, or an A for an O:
These were our great Faults! Many a brave and noble Spirit has been
there broken; others have run from thence and were never heard of
afterwards.</p><p>It is a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec168.txt')">worthy</a> Attempt to undertake the Cause of distrest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec168.txt')">Youth</a>; and
it is a noble Piece of _Knight-Errantry_ to enter the Lists against so
many armed Pedagogues. 'Tis pity but we had a Set of Men, polite in
their <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec168.txt')">Behaviour</a> and Method of Teaching, who should be put into a
Condition of being above flattering or fearing the Parents of those
they instruct. We might then possibly see <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec168.txt')">Learning</a> become a Pleasure,
and Children delighting themselves in that which now they abhor for
coming upon such hard Terms to them: What would be a still greater
Happiness arising from the Care of such Instructors, would be, that we
should have no more Pedants, nor any bred to Learning who had not
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec168.txt')">Genius</a> for it. I am, with the utmost Sincerity, _SIR, Your most
affectionate humble Servant_.</p><p>
_Richmond, Sept._ 5_th_, 1711.</p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a Boy of fourteen Years of Age, and have for this last Year been
under the Tuition of a Doctor of Divinity, who has taken the School of
this Place under his Care. [3] From the Gentleman's great Tenderness
to me and Friendship to my Father, I am very happy in learning my Book
with Pleasure. We never leave off our Diversions any farther than to
salute him at Hours of Play when he pleases to look on. It is
impossible for any of us to love our own Parents better than we do
him. He never gives any of us an harsh <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec168.txt')">Word</a>, and we think it the
greatest Punishment in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec168.txt')">World</a> when he will not <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec168.txt')">speak</a> to any of us.
My Brother and I are both together inditing this Letter: He is a Year
older than I am, but is now ready to break his Heart that the Doctor
has not taken any Notice of him these three Days. If you please to
print this he will see it, and, we hope, taking it for my Brother's
earnest Desire to be restored to his Favour, he will again smile upon
him.
_Your most obedient Servant_,
T. S.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>You have represented several sorts of _Impertinents_ singly, I wish
you would now proceed, and describe some of them in Sets. It often
happens in publick Assemblies, that a Party who came thither together,
or whose Impertinencies are of an equal Pitch, act in Concert, and are
so full of themselves as to give Disturbance to all that are about
them. Sometimes you have a Set of Whisperers, who lay their Heads
together in order to sacrifice every Body within their Observation;
sometimes a Set of Laughers, that keep up an insipid Mirth in their
own Corner, and by their Noise and Gestures shew they have no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec168.txt')">Respect</a>
for the rest of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec168.txt')">Company</a>. You frequently meet with these Sets at
the Opera, the Play, the Water-works, [4] and other publick Meetings,
where their whole Business is to draw off the Attention of the
Spectators from the Entertainment, and to fix it upon themselves; and
it is to be observed that the Impertinence is ever loudest, when the
Set happens to be made up of three or four Females who have got what
you <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec168.txt')">call</a> a Woman's Man among them.</p><p>I am at a loss to know from whom <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec168.txt')">People</a> of Fortune should learn this
Behaviour, unless it be from the Footmen who keep their Places at a
new Play, and are often seen passing away their Time in Sets at
_All-fours_ in the Face of a full House, and with a perfect Disregard
to People of Quality sitting on each Side of them.</p><p>For preserving therefore the Decency of publick Assemblies, methinks
it would be but reasonable that those who Disturb others should pay at
least a double Price for their Places; or rather Women of Birth and
Distinction should be informed that a Levity of Behaviour in the Eyes
of People of Understanding degrades them below their meanest
Attendants; and Gentlemen should know that a fine Coat is a Livery,
when the Person who wears it discovers no higher Sense than that of a
Footman.
I am _SIR_,
_Your most humble Servant._</p><p></p><p>_Bedfordshire, Sept.._ 1, 1711</p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am one of those whom every Body calls a Pocher, and sometimes go out
to course with a Brace of Greyhounds, a Mastiff, and a Spaniel or two;
and when I am weary with Coursing, and have killed Hares enough, go to
an Ale-house to refresh my self. I beg the Favour of you (as you set
up for a Reformer) to send us Word how many Dogs you will allow us to
go with, how many Full-Pots of Ale to drink, and how many Hares to
kill in a Day, and you will do a great Piece of Service to all the
Sportsmen: Be quick then, for the Time of Coursing is come on.</p><p>_Yours in Haste_,
T. Isaac Hedgeditch.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: 'Instit. Orat.' Bk. I. ch. 3.]</p><p>
