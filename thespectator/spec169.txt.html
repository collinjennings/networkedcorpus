<p>No. 169.                  Thursday, Sept. 13, 1711.           Addison</p><p></p><p>'_Sic vita erat: facile omnes perferre ac pati:
Cum quibus erat cunque una, his sese dedere,
Eorum obsequi studiis: advorsus nemini;
Nunquam præponens se aliis: Ita facillime
Sine invidia invenias laudem._'</p><p>Ter. And.</p><p>
<a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec169.txt')">Man</a> is subject to innumerable Pains and Sorrows by the very Condition of
Humanity, and yet, as if <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec169.txt')">Nature</a> had not sown Evils enough in Life, we
are continually adding <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec169.txt')">Grief</a> to Grief, and aggravating the common
Calamity by our cruel Treatment of one another. Every Man's natural
Weight of Afflictions is still made more heavy by the Envy, Malice,
Treachery, or Injustice of his Neighbour. At the same time that the
Storm beats upon the whole Species, we are falling foul upon one
another.</p><p>Half the Misery of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec169.txt')">Human</a> Life might be extinguished, would Men alleviate
the general Curse they lie under, by mutual Offices of Compassion,
Benevolence, and Humanity. There is nothing therefore which we ought
more to encourage in our selves and others, than that Disposition of
Mind which in our Language goes under the Title of Good-nature, and
which I shall chuse for the Subject of this Day's Speculation.</p><p>Good-nature is more <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec169.txt')">agreeable</a> in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec169.txt')">Conversation</a> than Wit, and gives a
certain Air to the Countenance which is more amiable than Beauty. It
shows Virtue in the fairest Light, takes off in some measure from the
Deformity of Vice, and makes even Folly and Impertinence supportable.</p><p>There is no Society or Conversation to be kept up in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec169.txt')">World</a> without
Good-nature, or something which must bear its Appearance, and supply its
Place. For this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec169.txt')">Reason</a> Mankind have been forced to invent a kind of
Artificial Humanity, which is what we express by the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec169.txt')">Word</a>
_Good-Breeding_. For if we examine thoroughly the Idea of what we <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec169.txt')">call</a>
so, we shall find it to be nothing else but an Imitation and Mimickry of
Good-nature, or in other Terms, Affability, Complaisance and Easiness of
Temper reduced into an Art.</p><p>These exterior Shows and Appearances of Humanity render a Man
wonderfully popular and beloved when they are founded upon a real
Good-nature; but without it are like Hypocrisy in Religion, or a bare
Form of Holiness, which, when it is discovered, makes a Man more
detestable than professed Impiety.</p><p>Good-nature is generally born with us: Health, Prosperity and kind
Treatment from the World are <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec169.txt')">great</a> Cherishers of it where they find it;
but nothing is capable of forcing it up, where it does not grow of it
self. It is one of the Blessings of a happy Constitution, which
Education may improve but not produce.</p><p>Xenophon [1] in the Life of his Imaginary <a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec169.txt')">Prince</a>, whom he describes as a
Pattern for Real ones, is always celebrating the _Philanthropy_ or
Good-nature of his Hero, which he tells us he brought into the World
with him, and gives many remarkable Instances of it in his Childhood, as
well as in all the several Parts of his Life. Nay, on his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec169.txt')">Death</a>-bed, he
describes him as being pleased, that while his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec169.txt')">Soul</a> returned to him [who
[2]] made it, his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec169.txt')">Body</a> should incorporate with the great Mother of all
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec169.txt')">things</a>, and by that means become beneficial to Mankind. For which
Reason, he gives his Sons a positive Order not to enshrine it in Gold or
Silver, but to lay it in the Earth as soon as the Life was gone out of
it.</p><p>An Instance of such an Overflowing of Humanity, such an exuberant Love
to Mankind, could not have entered into the Imagination of a Writer, who
had not a Soul filled with great Ideas, and a general Benevolence to
Mankind.</p><p>In that celebrated Passage of _Salust_, [3] where _Cæsar_ and _Cato_ are
placed in such beautiful, but opposite Lights; _Cæsar's_ Character is
chiefly made up of Good-nature, as it shewed itself in all its Forms
towards his Friends or his Enemies, his Servants or Dependants, the
Guilty or the Distressed. As for _Cato's_ Character, it is rather awful
than amiable. Justice seems most agreeable to the Nature of God, and
Mercy to that of Man. A Being who has nothing to Pardon in himself, may
reward every Man according to his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec169.txt')">Works</a>; but he whose very best Actions
must be seen with Grains of Allowance, cannot be too mild, moderate, and
forgiving. For this reason, among all the monstrous Characters in Human
Nature, there is none so odious, nor indeed so exquisitely Ridiculous,
as that of a rigid severe Temper in a Worthless Man.</p><p>This Part of Good-nature, however, which consists in the pardoning and
overlooking of Faults, is to be exercised only in doing our selves
Justice, and that too in the ordinary Commerce and Occurrences of Life;
for in the publick Administrations of Justice, Mercy to one may be
Cruelty to others.</p><p>It is grown almost into a Maxim, that Good-natured Men are not always
Men of the most Wit. This Observation, in my Opinion, has no Foundation
in Nature. The greatest Wits I have conversed with are Men eminent for
their Humanity. I take therefore this Remark to have been occasioned by
two Reasons. First, Because Ill-nature among ordinary Observers passes
for Wit. A spiteful Saying gratifies so many little Passions in those
who hear it, that it generally meets with a good Reception. The Laugh
rises upon it, and the Man who utters it is looked upon as a shrewd
Satyrist. This may be one Reason, why a great many pleasant Companions
appear so surprisingly dull, when they have endeavoured to be Merry in
Print; the Publick being more just than Private Clubs or Assemblies, in
distinguishing between what is Wit and what is Ill-nature.</p><p>Another Reason why the Good-natured Man may sometimes bring his Wit in
Question, is, perhaps, because he is apt to be moved with Compassion for
those Misfortunes or Infirmities, which another would turn into
Ridicule, and by that means gain the Reputation of a Wit. The
Ill-natured Man, though but of equal Parts, gives himself a larger Field
to expatiate in; he exposes those Failings in Human Nature which the
other would cast a Veil over, laughs at Vices which the other either
excuses or conceals, gives utterance to Reflections which the other
stifles, falls indifferently upon Friends or Enemies, exposes the Person
[who [4]] has obliged him, and, in short, sticks at nothing that may
establish his Character of a Wit. It is no Wonder therefore he succeeds
in it better than the Man of Humanity, as a Person who makes use of
indirect Methods, is more likely to grow Rich than the Fair Trader.</p><p>L.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: 'Cyropædia', Bk. viii. ch. 6.]</p><p>

general, without giving Offence to any particular Person, it would be
difficult to find out so proper a Patron for it as Your Self, there
being none whose <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec169.txt')">Merit</a> is more universally acknowledged by all Parties,
and who has made himself more Friends and fewer Enemies. Your great
Abilities, and unquestioned Integrity, in those high Employments which
You have passed through, would not have been able to have raised You
this general Approbation, had they not been accompanied with that
Moderation in an high Fortune, and that Affability of Manners, which are
so conspicuous through all Parts of your Life. Your Aversion to any
Ostentatious Arts of setting to Show those great Services which you have
done the Publick, has not likewise a little contributed to that
Universal Acknowledgment which is paid You by your Country.</p><p>The Consideration of this Part of Your Character, is that which hinders
me from enlarging on those Extraordinary Talents, which have given You
so great a Figure in the _British_ Senate, as well as on that Elegance
and Politeness which appear in Your more retired Conversation. I should
be unpardonable, if, after what I have said, I should longer detain You
with an Address of this Nature: I cannot, however, conclude it without
owning those great Obligations which You have laid upon,</p><p>_SIR,</p><p>Your most obedient,</p><p>humble Servant_,</p><p>THE SPECTATOR.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Henry Boyle, to whom the third volume of the Spectator is
dedicated, was the youngest son of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec169.txt')">Charles</a>, Lord Clifford; one of the
family founded by the Richard, Earl of Cork, who bought Raleigh's
property in Ireland.</p><p>From March, 1701, to February, 1707-8, Henry Boyle was <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec169.txt')">King</a> William's
Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was then, till September, 1710, one of
the principal Secretaries of State. He had materially helped Addison by
negotiating between him and Lord Godolphin respecting the celebration of
the Battle of Blenheim. On the accession of George I. Henry Boyle became
Lord Carleton and President of the Council. He died in 1724, and had his
Life written by Addison's cousin Budgell.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
