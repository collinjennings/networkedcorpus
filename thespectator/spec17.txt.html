<p>No. 17.               Tuesday, March 20, 1711.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>'... Tetrum ante Omnia vultum.'</p><p>Juv.</p><p>
Since our Persons are not of our own Making, when they are such as
appear Defective or Uncomely, it is, methinks, an honest and laudable
Fortitude to dare to be Ugly; at least to keep our selves from being
abashed with a Consciousness of Imperfections which we cannot help, and
in which there is no Guilt. I would not defend an haggard Beau, for
passing away much time at a Glass, and giving Softnesses and Languishing
Graces to Deformity. All I intend is, that we ought to be contented with
our <a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec17.txt')">Countenance</a> and Shape, so far, as never to give our selves an
uneasie Reflection on that Subject. It is to the ordinary <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec17.txt')">People</a>, who
are not accustomed to make very proper Remarks on any Occasion, matter
of great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec17.txt')">Jest</a>, if a Man enters with a prominent Pair of Shoulders into
an Assembly, or is distinguished by an Expansion of Mouth, or Obliquity
of Aspect. It is happy for a Man, that has any of these Oddnesses about
him, if he can be as <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec17.txt')">merry</a> upon himself, as others are apt to be upon
that Occasion: When he can possess himself with such a Chearfulness,
Women and Children, who were at first frighted at him, will afterwards
be as much pleased with him. As it is barbarous in others to railly him
for natural Defects, it is extreamly <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec17.txt')">agreeable</a> when he can Jest upon
himself for them.</p><p>Madam _Maintenon's_ first Husband was an Hero in this Kind, and has
drawn many Pleasantries from the Irregularity of his Shape, which he
describes as very much resembling the Letter Z. [1] He diverts himself
likewise by representing to his Reader the Make of an Engine and Pully,
with which he used to take off his <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec17.txt')">Hat</a>. When there happens to be any
thing ridiculous in a Visage, and the Owner of it thinks it an Aspect of
Dignity, he must be of very great Quality to be exempt from Raillery:
The best Expedient therefore is to be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec17.txt')">pleasant</a> upon himself. Prince
_Harry_ and _Falstaffe_, in _Shakespear_, have carried the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec17.txt')">Ridicule</a> upon
Fat and Lean as far as it will go. _Falstaffe_ is Humourously called
_Woolsack_, _Bed-presser_, and _Hill of Flesh_; Harry a _Starveling_, an
_Elves-Skin_, a _Sheath_, a _Bowcase_, and a _Tuck_. There is, in
several incidents of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec17.txt')">Conversation</a> between them, the Jest still kept
up upon the Person. Great Tenderness and Sensibility in this Point is
one of the greatest Weaknesses of Self-love; for my own part, I am a
little unhappy in the Mold of my Face, which is not quite so long as it
is broad: Whether this might not partly arise from my opening my Mouth
much seldomer than other People, and by Consequence not so much
lengthning the Fibres of my Visage, I am not at leisure to determine.
However it be, I have been often put out of Countenance by the Shortness
of my Face, and was formerly at great Pains in concealing it by wearing
a Periwigg with an high Foretop, and letting my Beard grow. But now I
have thoroughly got over this Delicacy, and could be contented it were
much shorter, provided it might qualify me for a <a name="topic46" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec17.txt')">Member</a> of the Merry
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec17.txt')">Club</a>, which the following Letter gives me an Account of. I have received
it from _Oxford_, and as it abounds with the Spirit of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec17.txt')">Mirth</a> and good
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec17.txt')">Humour</a>, which is natural to that Place, I shall set it down <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec17.txt')">Word</a> for
Word as it came to me.</p><p>'Most Profound Sir,</p><p>Having been very well entertained, in the last of your Speculations
that I have yet seen, by your Specimen upon <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec17.txt')">Clubs</a>, which I therefore
hope you will continue, I shall take the Liberty to furnish you with a
brief Account of such a one as perhaps you have not seen in all your
Travels, unless it was your Fortune to touch upon some of the woody
Parts of the _African_ Continent, in your Voyage to or from _Grand
Cairo_. There have arose in this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec17.txt')">University</a> (long since you left us
without saying any thing) several of these inferior Hebdomadal
Societies, as _the Punning Club_, _the Witty Club_, and amongst the
rest, the _Handsom Club_; as a Burlesque upon which, a certain merry
Species, that seem to have come into the World in Masquerade, for some
Years last past have associated themselves together, and assumed the
name of the _Ugly Club_: This ill-favoured Fraternity consists of a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec17.txt')">President</a> and twelve Fellows; the Choice of which is not confin'd by
Patent to any particular Foundation (as _St. John's_ Men would have
the World believe, and have therefore erected a separate <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec17.txt')">Society</a>
within themselves) but Liberty is left to elect from any School in
_Great Britain_, provided the Candidates be within the Rules of the
Club, as set forth in a Table entituled _The Act of Deformity_. A
Clause or two of which I shall transmit to you.</p><p>I. That no Person whatsoever shall be admitted without a visible
Quearity in his Aspect, or peculiar Cast of Countenance; of which the
President and Officers for the time being are to determine, and the
President to have the casting Voice.</p><p>II. That a singular Regard be had, upon Examination, to the Gibbosity
of the Gentlemen that offer themselves, as Founders Kinsmen, or to the
Obliquity of their Figure, in what sort soever.</p><p>III. That if the Quantity of any Man's Nose be eminently
miscalculated, whether as to Length or Breadth, he shall have a just
Pretence to be elected.</p><p>_Lastly_, That if there shall be two or more Competitors for the same
Vacancy, _caeteris paribus_, he that has the thickest Skin to have the
Preference.</p><p>Every fresh Member, upon his first Night, is to entertain the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec17.txt')">Company</a>
with a Dish of Codfish, and a Speech in praise of _Æsop_; [2] whose
portraiture they have in full Proportion, or rather Disproportion,
over the Chimney; and their Design is, as soon as their Funds are
sufficient, to purchase the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec17.txt')">Heads</a> of _Thersites, Duns Scotus, Scarron,
Hudibras_, and the old Gentleman in _Oldham_, [3] with all the
celebrated ill Faces of Antiquity, as Furniture for the Club Room.</p><p>As they have always been profess'd Admirers of the other Sex, so they
unanimously declare that they will give all possible Encouragement to
such as will take the Benefit of the Statute, tho' none yet have
appeared to do it.</p><p>The worthy President, who is their most devoted Champion, has lately
shown me two Copies of Verses composed by a Gentleman of his Society;
the first, a Congratulatory Ode inscrib'd to Mrs. _Touchwood_, upon
the loss of her two Fore-teeth; the other, a Panegyrick upon Mrs.
_Andirons_ left Shoulder. Mrs. _Vizard_ (he says) since the Small Pox,
is grown tolerably ugly, and a top Toast in the Club; but I never hear
him so lavish of his fine things, as upon old _Nell Trot_, who
constantly officiates at their Table; her he even adores, and extolls
as the very Counterpart of Mother _Shipton_; in short, _Nell_ (says
he) is one of the Extraordinary Works of Nature; but as for
Complexion, Shape, and Features, so valued by others, they are all
meer Outside and Symmetry, which is his Aversion. Give me leave to
add, that the President is a facetious, pleasant Gentleman, and never
more so, than when he has got (as he calls 'em) his dear Mummers about
him; and he often protests it does him good to meet a Fellow with a
right genuine Grimmace in his Air, (which is so agreeable in the
generality of the _French_ Nation;) and as an Instance of his
Sincerity in this particular, he gave me a sight of a List in his
Pocket-book of all of this Class, who for these five Years have fallen
under his Observation, with himself at the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec17.txt')">Head</a> of 'em, and in the
Rear (as one of a promising and improving Aspect),</p><p>Sir, Your Obliged and Humble Servant,</p><p>Alexander Carbuncle.'              [Sidenote: Oxford, March 12, 1710.]</p><p>
R.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Abbé Paul Scarron, the burlesque writer, high in court
favour, was deformed from birth, and at the age of 27 lost the use of
all his limbs. In 1651, when 41 years old, Scarron married Frances
d'Aubigné, afterwards Madame de Maintenon; her age was then 16, and she
lived with Scarron until his death, which occurred when she was 25 years
old and left her very poor. Scarron's comparison of himself to the
letter Z is in his address 'To the Reader who has Never seen Me,'
prefixed to his 'Relation Véritable de tout ce qui s'est passé en
l'autre Monde, au combat des Parques et des Poëtes, sur la Mort de
Voiture.' This was illustrated with a burlesque plate representing
himself as seen from the back of his chair, and surrounded by a
wondering and mocking world. His back, he said, was turned to the
public, because the convex of his back is more convenient than the
concave of his stomach for receiving the inscription of his name and
age.]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: The Life of Æsop, ascribed to Planudes Maximus, a monk of
Constantinople in the fourteenth century, and usually prefixed to the
Fables, says that he was 'the most deformed of all men of his age, for
he had a pointed head, flat nostrils, a short neck, thick lips, was
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec17.txt')">black</a>, pot-bellied, bow-legged, and hump-backed; perhaps even uglier
than Homer's Thersites.']</p><p>
[Footnote 3: The description of Thersites in the second book of the
Iliad is thus translated by Professor Blackie:</p><p>'The most
Ill-favoured wight was he, I ween, of all the Grecian host.
With hideous squint the railer leered: on one foot he was lame;
Forward before his narrow chest his hunching shoulders came;
Slanting and sharp his forehead rose, with shreds of meagre hair.'</p><p>Controversies between the Scotists and Thomists, followers of the
teaching of Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas, caused Thomist perversion of
the name of Duns into its use as Dunce and tradition of the subtle
Doctor's extreme personal ugliness. Doctor Subtilis was translated The
Lath Doctor.</p><p>Scarron we have just spoken of. Hudibras's outward gifts are described
in Part I., Canto i., lines 240-296 of the poem.</p><p>'His beard
In cut and dye so like a tile
A sudden view it would beguile:
The upper part thereof was whey;
The nether, orange mix'd with grey.
This hairy meteor, &c.'</p><p>The 'old Gentleman in _Oldham_' is Loyola, as described in Oldham's
third satire on the Jesuits, when</p><p>'Summon'd together, all th' officious band
The orders of their bedrid, chief attend.'</p><p>Raised on his pillow he greets them, and, says Oldham,</p><p>'Like Delphic Hag of old, by Fiend possest,
He swells, wild Frenzy heaves his panting breast,
His bristling hairs stick up, his eyeballs glow,
And from his mouth long strakes of drivel flow.']</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
