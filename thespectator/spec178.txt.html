<p>No. 178.                Monday, September 24, 1711.              Steele.</p><p>
'Comis in uxorem ...'</p><p>Hor.</p><p>I cannot defer taking Notice of this Letter.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am but too good a Judge of your Paper of the 15th Instant, which is
a Master-piece; I mean that of Jealousy: But I think it unworthy of
you to <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec178.txt')">speak</a> of that Torture in the Breast of a Man, and not to
mention also the Pangs of it in the <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec178.txt')">Heart</a> of a <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec178.txt')">Woman</a>. You have very
Judiciously, and with the greatest Penetration imaginable, considered
it as Woman is the Creature of whom the Diffidence is raised; but not
a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec178.txt')">Word</a> of a Man who is so unmerciful as to move Jealousy in his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec178.txt')">Wife</a>,
and not care whether she is so or not. It is possible you may not
believe there are such Tyrants in the World; but alas, I can tell you
of a Man who is ever out of Humour in his Wife's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec178.txt')">Company</a>, and the
pleasantest Man in the World every where else; the greatest Sloven at
home when he appears to none but his Family, and most exactly
well-dressed in all other Places. Alas, Sir, is it of Course, that to
deliver one's self wholly into a Man's Power without Possibility of
Appeal to any other Jurisdiction but to his own Reflections, is so
little an Obligation to a Gentleman, that he can be offended and fall
into a Rage, because my Heart swells <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec178.txt')">Tears</a> into my Eyes when I see him
in a cloudy Mood? I pretend to no Succour, and hope for no Relief but
from himself; and yet he that has Sense and Justice in every thing
else, never reflects, that to come home only to sleep off an
Intemperance, and spend all the Time he is there as if it were a
Punishment, cannot but give the Anguish of a jealous Mind. He always
leaves his Home as if he were going to Court, and returns as if he
were entring a Gaol. I could add to this, that from his Company and
his usual Discourse, he does not scruple being thought an abandoned
Man, as to his Morals. Your own Imagination will say enough to you
concerning the Condition of me his Wife; and I wish you would be so
good as to represent to him, for he is not ill-natured, and reads you
much, that the Moment I hear the Door shut after him, I throw myself
upon my Bed, and drown the Child he is so fond of with my Tears, and
often frighten it with my Cries; that I curse my Being; that I run to
my Glass all over bathed in Sorrows, and help the Utterance of my
inward Anguish by beholding the Gush of my own Calamities as my Tears
fall from my Eyes. This looks like an imagined Picture to tell you,
but indeed this is one of my Pastimes. Hitherto I have only told you
the general Temper of my Mind, but how shall I give you an Account of
the Distraction of it? Could you but conceive how cruel I am one
Moment in my Resentment, and at the ensuing Minute, when I place him
in the Condition my Anger would bring him to, how compassionate; it
would give you some Notion how miserable I am, and how little I
deserve it. When I remonstrate with the greatest Gentleness that is
possible against unhandsome Appearances, and that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec178.txt')">married</a> Persons are
under particular Rules; when he is in the best Humour to receive this,
I am answered only, That I expose my own Reputation and Sense if I
appear jealous. I wish, good Sir, you would take this into serious
Consideration, and admonish <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec178.txt')">Husbands</a> and Wives what Terms they ought
to keep towards each other. Your Thoughts on this important Subject
will have the greatest Reward, that which descends on such as feel the
Sorrows of the Afflicted. Give me leave to subscribe my self,
Your unfortunate humble Servant,
CELINDA.</p><p>I had it in my Thoughts, before I received the Letter of this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec178.txt')">Lady</a>, to
consider this dreadful Passion in the Mind of a Woman; and the Smart she
seems to feel does not abate the Inclination I had to recommend to
Husbands a more regular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec178.txt')">Behaviour</a>, than to give the most exquisite of
Torments to those who <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec178.txt')">love</a> them, nay whose Torment would be abated if
they did not love them.</p><p>It is wonderful to observe how little is made of this inexpressible
Injury, and how easily Men get into a Habit of being least <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec178.txt')">agreeable</a>
where they are most obliged to be so. But this Subject deserves a
distinct Speculation, and I shall observe for a Day or two the Behaviour
of two or three happy Pair I am acquainted with, before I pretend to
make a System of Conjugal Morality. I design in the first Place to go a
few Miles out of Town, and there I know where to meet one who practises
all the Parts of a fine Gentleman in the Duty of an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec178.txt')">Husband</a>. When he was
a Batchelor much Business made him particularly negligent in his Habit;
but now there is no young Lover living so exact in the Care of his
Person. One who asked why he was so long washing his Mouth, and so
delicate in the Choice and Wearing of his Linen, was answered, Because
there is a Woman of Merit obliged to receive me kindly, and I think it
incumbent upon me to make her Inclination go along with her Duty.</p><p>If a Man would give himself leave to think, he would not be so
unreasonable as to expect Debauchery and Innocence could live in
Commerce together; or hope that Flesh and Blood is capable of so strict
an Allegiance, as that a fine Woman must go on to improve her self 'till
she is as good and impassive as an Angel, only to preserve a Fidelity to
a Brute and a Satyr. The Lady who desires me for her Sake to end one of
my Papers with the following Letter, I am persuaded, thinks such a
Perseverance very impracticable.</p><p>_Husband_,
Stay more at home. I know where you visited at Seven of [the] Clock on
_Thursday_ Evening. The Colonel whom you charged me to see no more, is
in Town.
_Martha Housewife_.</p><p>
