It is my Design in this Paper to deliver down to Posterity a faithful
Account of the <a name="topic47" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec18.txt')">Italian</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec18.txt')">Opera</a>, and of the gradual Progress which it has
made upon the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec18.txt')">English</a> <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec18.txt')">Stage</a>: For there is no Question but our great
Grand-children will be very curious to know the Reason why their
Fore-fathers used to sit together like an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec18.txt')">Audience</a> of Foreigners in
their own Country, and to hear whole Plays acted before them in a Tongue
which they did not understand.</p><p>'Arsinoe' [1] was the first Opera that gave us a Taste of Italian
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec18.txt')">Musick</a>. The great Success this Opera met with, produced some Attempts of
forming Pieces upon Italian Plans, [which [2]] should give a more
natural and reasonable Entertainment than what can be met with in the
elaborate Trifles of that Nation. This alarm'd the Poetasters and
Fidlers of the Town, who were used to deal in a more ordinary <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec18.txt')">Kind</a> of
Ware; and therefore laid down an establish'd Rule, which is receiv'd as
such to this [Day, [3]] 'That nothing is capable of being well set to
Musick, that is not Nonsense.'</p><p>This Maxim was no sooner receiv'd, but we immediately fell to
translating the Italian Operas; and as there was no great Danger of
hurting the Sense of those extraordinary Pieces, our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec18.txt')">Authors</a> would often
make <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec18.txt')">Words</a> of their own [which[ 4]] were entirely foreign to the Meaning
of the Passages [they [5]] pretended to translate; their chief Care
being to make the Numbers of the English <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec18.txt')">Verse</a> answer to those of the
Italian, that both of them might go to the same Tune. Thus the famous
Song in 'Camilla',</p><p>'Barbara si t' intendo, &c.'</p><p>Barbarous Woman, yes, I know your Meaning,</p><p>which expresses the Resentments of an angry Lover, was translated into
that English lamentation:</p><p>'Frail are a Lovers Hopes, &c.'</p><p>And it was pleasant enough to see the most refined Persons of the
British Nation dying away and languishing to Notes that were filled with
a Spirit of Rage and Indignation. It happen'd also very frequently,
where the Sense was rightly translated, the necessary Transposition of
Words [which [6]] were drawn out of the Phrase of one Tongue into that
of another, made the Musick appear very absurd in one Tongue that was
very natural in the other. I remember an Italian verse that ran thus
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec18.txt')">Word</a> for Word,</p><p>'And turned my Rage, into Pity;'</p><p>which the English for Rhime sake translated,</p><p>'And into Pity turn'd my Rage.'</p><p>By this Means the soft Notes that were adapted to Pity in the Italian,
fell upon the word Rage in the English; and the angry Sounds that were
turn'd to Rage in the Original, were made to express Pity in the
Translation. It oftentimes happen'd likewise, that the finest Notes in
the Air fell upon the most insignificant Words in the Sentence. I have
known the Word 'And' pursu'd through the whole Gamut, have been
entertained with many a melodious 'The', and have heard the most
beautiful Graces Quavers and Divisions bestowed upon 'Then, For,' and
'From;' to the eternal Honour of our English Particles. [7]</p><p>The next Step to our Refinement, was the introducing of Italian <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec18.txt')">Actors</a>
into our Opera; who sung their Parts in their own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec18.txt')">Language</a>, at the same
Time that our Countrymen perform'd theirs in our native Tongue. The King
or Hero of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec18.txt')">Play</a> generally spoke in Italian, and his Slaves answered
him in English: The Lover frequently made his Court, and gained the
Heart of his Princess in a Language which she did not understand. One
would have thought it very difficult to have carry'd on Dialogues after
this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec18.txt')">Manner</a>, without an Interpreter between the Persons that convers'd
together; but this was the State of the English Stage for about three
Years.</p><p>At length the Audience grew tir'd of understanding Half the Opera, and
therefore to ease themselves Entirely of the Fatigue of Thinking, have
so order'd it at Present that the whole Opera is performed in an unknown
Tongue. We no longer understand the Language of our own Stage; insomuch
that I have often been afraid, when I have seen our Italian Performers
chattering in the Vehemence of Action, that they have been calling us
Names, and abusing us among themselves; but I hope, since we do put such
an entire Confidence in them, they will not talk against us before our
Faces, though they may do it with the same Safety as if it [were [8]]
behind our Backs. In the mean Time I cannot forbear thinking how
naturally an Historian, who writes Two or Three hundred Years hence, and
does not know the Taste of his wise Fore-fathers, will make the
following Reflection, 'In the Beginning of the Eighteenth Century, the
Italian Tongue was so well understood in _England_, that Operas were
acted on the publick Stage in that Language.'</p><p>One scarce knows how to be serious in the Confutation of an Absurdity
that shews itself at the first Sight. It does not want any great Measure
of Sense to see the Ridicule of this monstrous Practice; but what makes
it the more astonishing, it is not the Taste of the Rabble, but of
Persons of the greatest Politeness, which has establish'd it.</p><p>If the Italians have a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec18.txt')">Genius</a> for Musick above the English, the English
have a Genius for other Performances of a much higher Nature, and
capable of giving the Mind a much nobler Entertainment. Would one think
it was possible (at a Time when an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec18.txt')">Author</a> lived that was able to write
the 'Ph√¶dra' and 'Hippolitus') [9] for a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec18.txt')">People</a> to be so stupidly fond
of the Italian Opera, as scarce to give a Third Days Hearing to that
admirable <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec18.txt')">Tragedy</a>? Musick is certainly a very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec18.txt')">agreeable</a> Entertainment,
but if it would take the entire Possession of our Ears, if it would make
us incapable of hearing Sense, if it would exclude Arts that have a much
greater Tendency to the Refinement of humane Nature: I must confess I
would allow it no better Quarter than 'Plato' has done, who banishes it
out of his Common-wealth.</p><p>At present, our Notions of Musick are so very uncertain, that we do not
know what it is we like, only, in general, we are transported with any
thing that is not English: so if it be of a foreign Growth, let it be
Italian, French, or High-Dutch, it is the same thing. In short, our
English Musick is quite rooted out, and nothing yet planted in its
stead.</p><p>When a Royal Palace is burnt to the Ground, every Man is at Liberty to
present his Plan for a new one; and tho' it be but indifferently put
together, it may furnish several Hints that may be of Use to a good
Architect. I shall take the same Liberty in a following Paper, of giving
my Opinion upon the Subject of Musick, which I shall lay down only in a
problematical Manner to be considered by those who are Masters in the
Art.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: 'Arsinoe' was produced at Drury Lane in 1705, with Mrs.
Tofts in the chief character, and her Italian rival, Margarita de
l'Epine, singing Italian songs before and after the Opera. The drama was
an Italian opera translated into English, and set to new <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec18.txt')">music</a> by Thomas
Clayton, formerly band master to William III. No. 20 of the Spectator
and other numbers from time to time advertised 'The Passion of Sappho,
and Feast of Alexander: Set to Musick by Mr. Thomas Clayton, as it is
performed at his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec18.txt')">house</a> in 'York Buildings.' It was the same Clayton who
set to music Addison's unsuccessful opera of 'Rosamond', written as an
experiment in substituting homegrown literature for the fashionable
nonsense illustrated by Italian music. Thomas Clayton's music to
'Rosamond' was described as 'a jargon of sounds.' 'Camilla', composed by
Marco Antonio Buononcini, and said to contain beautiful music, was
produced at Sir John Vanbrugh's Haymarket opera in 1705, and sung half
in English, half in Italian; Mrs. Tofts singing the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec18.txt')">part</a> of the
Amazonian heroine in English, and Valentini that of the hero in Italian.]</p><p>

[Footnote 9: The Tragedy of 'Ph√¶dra and Hippolitus', acted without
success in 1707, was the one play written by Mr. Edmund Smith, a
merchant's son who had been educated at Westminster School and Christ
Church, Oxford, and who had ended a dissolute life at the age of 42 (in
1710), very shortly before this paper was written. Addison's regard for
the play is warmed by friendship for the unhappy writer. He had, indeed,
written the Prologue to it, and struck therein also his note of war
against the follies of Italian Opera.</p><p>'Had Valentini, musically coy,
Shunned Ph√¶dra's Arms, and scorn'd the puffer'd Joy,
It had not momed your Wonder to have seen
An Eunich fly from an enamour'd Queen;
How would it please, should she in English <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec18.txt')">speak</a>,
And could Hippolitus reply in Greek!'</p><p>The Epilogue to this play was by Prior. Edmund Smith's relation to
Addison is shown by the fact that, in dedicating the printed edition of
his Ph√¶dra and Hippolitus to Lord Halifax, he speaks of Addison's lines
on the Peace of Ryswick as 'the best Latin Poem since the √Üneid.']</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
