<p>No. 185.                Tuesday, October 2, 1711.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'... Tantæne Animis coelestibus Iræ?'</p><p>Virg.</p><p>
There is nothing in which Men more deceive themselves than in what the
<a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec185.txt')">World</a> calls Zeal. There are so many <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec185.txt')">Passions</a> which hide themselves under
it, and so many Mischiefs arising from it, that some have gone so far as
to say it would have been for the Benefit of Mankind if it had never
been reckoned in the Catalogue of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec185.txt')">Virtues</a>. It is certain, where it is
once Laudable and Prudential, it is an hundred times Criminal and
Erroneous; nor can it be otherwise, if we consider that it operates with
equal Violence in all Religions, however opposite they may be to one
another, and in all the Subdivisions of each <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec185.txt')">Religion</a> in particular.</p><p>We are told by some of the Jewish Rabbins, that the first Murder was
occasioned by a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec185.txt')">religious</a> Controversy; and if we had the whole History
of Zeal from the Days of Cain to our own Times, we should see it filled
with so many Scenes of Slaughter and Bloodshed, as would make a wise <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec185.txt')">Man</a>
very careful how he suffers himself to be actuated by such a Principle,
when it only regards Matters of Opinion and Speculation.</p><p>I would have every Zealous Man examine his Heart thoroughly, and, I
believe, he will often find, that what he calls a Zeal for his Religion,
is either Pride, Interest, or Ill-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec185.txt')">nature</a>. [A Man who [1]] differs from
another in Opinion, sets himself above him in his own Judgment, and in
several Particulars pretends to be the wiser Person. This is a great
Provocation to the proud Man, and gives a very keen Edge to what he
calls his Zeal. And that this is the Case very often, we may observe
from the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec185.txt')">Behaviour</a> of some of the most zealous for Orthodoxy, who have
often great Friendships and Intimacies with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec185.txt')">vicious</a> immoral Men,
provided they do but agree with them in the same Scheme of Belief. The
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec185.txt')">Reason</a> is, Because the vicious Believer gives the Precedency to the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec185.txt')">virtuous</a> Man, and allows the good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec185.txt')">Christian</a> to be the worthier Person,
at the same time that he cannot come up to his Perfections. This we find
exemplified in that trite Passage which we see quoted in almost every
System of Ethicks, tho' upon another Occasion.</p><p>'... Video meliora proboque,
Deteriora sequor ...'</p><p>(Ov.)</p><p>On the contrary, it is certain, if our Zeal were true and genuine, we
should be much more angry with a Sinner than a Heretick; since there are
several Cases [which [2]] may excuse the latter before his great Judge,
but none [which [3]] can excuse the former.</p><p>Interest is likewise a great Inflamer, and sets a Man on Persecution
under the colour of Zeal. For this Reason we find none are so forward to
promote the true <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec185.txt')">Worship</a> by Fire and Sword, as those who find their
present Account in it. But I shall extend the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec185.txt')">Word</a> Interest to a larger
Meaning than what is generally given it, as it relates to our Spiritual
Safety and Welfare, as well as to our Temporal. A Man is glad to gain
Numbers on his Side, as they serve to strengthen him in his private
Opinions. Every Proselyte is like a new Argument for the Establishment
of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec185.txt')">Faith</a>. It makes him believe that his Principles carry Conviction
with them, and are the more likely to be true, when he finds they are
conformable to the Reason of others, as well as to his own. And that
this Temper of Mind deludes a Man very often into an Opinion of his
Zeal, may appear from the common Behaviour of the Atheist, who maintains
and spreads his Opinions with as much Heat as those who believe they do
it only out of Passion for <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec185.txt')">God</a>'s Glory.</p><p>Ill-nature is another dreadful Imitator of Zeal. Many a good Man may
have a natural Rancour and Malice in his Heart, [which [4]] has been in
some measure quelled and subdued by Religion; but if it finds any
Pretence of breaking out, which does not seem to him inconsistent with
the Duties of a Christian, it throws off all Restraint, and rages in its
full Fury. Zeal is therefore a great Ease to a malicious Man, by making
him believe he does God Service, whilst he is gratifying the Bent of a
perverse revengeful Temper. For this Reason we find, that most of the
Massacres and Devastations, [which [5]] have been in the World, have
taken their Rise from a furious pretended Zeal.</p><p>I love to see a Man zealous in a good Matter, and especially when his
Zeal shews it self for advancing Morality, and promoting the Happiness
of Mankind: But when I find the Instruments he <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec185.txt')">works</a> with are Racks and
Gibbets, Gallies and Dungeons; when he imprisons Mens Persons,
confiscates their Estates, ruins their Families, and burns the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec185.txt')">Body</a> to
save the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec185.txt')">Soul</a>, I cannot stick to pronounce of such a one, that (whatever
he may think of his Faith and Religion) his Faith is vain, and his
Religion unprofitable.</p><p>After having treated of these false Zealots in Religion, I cannot
forbear mentioning a monstrous Species of Men, who one would not think
had any Existence in Nature, were they not to be met with in ordinary
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec185.txt')">Conversation</a>, I mean the Zealots in Atheism. One would fancy that these
Men, tho' they fall short, in every other Respect, of those who make a
Profession of Religion, would at least outshine them in this Particular,
and be exempt from that single Fault which seems to grow out of the
imprudent Fervours of Religion: But so it is, that Infidelity is
propagated with as much Fierceness and Contention, Wrath and
Indignation, as if the Safety of Mankind depended upon it. There is
something so ridiculous and perverse in this kind of Zealots, that one
does not know how to set them out in their proper Colours. They are a
Sort of Gamesters [who [6]] are eternally upon the Fret, though they
play for nothing. They are perpetually teizing their Friends to come
over to them, though at the same time they allow that neither of them
shall get any thing by the Bargain. In short, the Zeal of spreading
Atheism is, if possible, more absurd than Atheism it self.</p><p>Since I have mentioned this unaccountable Zeal which appears in Atheists
and Infidels, I must further observe that they are likewise in a most
particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec185.txt')">manner</a> possessed with the Spirit of Bigotry. They are wedded
to Opinions full of Contradiction and Impossibility, and at the same
time look upon the smallest Difficulty in an Article of Faith as a
sufficient Reason for rejecting it. Notions that fall in with the common
Reason of Mankind, that are conformable to the Sense of all Ages and all
Nations, not to mention their Tendency for promoting the Happiness of
Societies, or of particular Persons, are exploded as Errors and
Prejudices; and Schemes erected in their stead that are altogether
monstrous and irrational, and require the most extravagant Credulity to
embrace them. I would fain ask one of these bigotted Infidels, supposing
all the great Points of Atheism, as the casual or eternal Formation of
the World, the Materiality of a thinking Substance, the Mortality of the
Soul, the fortuitous Organization of the Body, the Motions and
Gravitation of Matter, with the like Particulars, were laid together and
formed [into [7]] a kind of Creed, according to the Opinions of the most
celebrated Atheists; I say, supposing such a Creed as this were formed,
and imposed upon any one <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec185.txt')">People</a> in the World, whether it would not
require an infinitely greater Measure of Faith, than any Set of Articles
which they so violently oppose. Let me therefore advise this Generation
of Wranglers, for their own and for the publick Good, to act at least so
consistently with themselves, as not to burn with Zeal for Irreligion,
and with Bigotry for Nonsense.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: The Man that]</p><p>
