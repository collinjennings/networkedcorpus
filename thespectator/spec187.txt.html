<p>No. 187.                Thursday, October 4, 1711.              Steele.</p><p>
'... Miseri quibus
Intentata nites ...'</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
The Intelligence given by this Correspondent is so important and useful,
in order to avoid the Persons he speaks of, that I shall insert his
Letter at length.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I do not know that you have ever touched upon a certain species of
<a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec187.txt')">Women</a>, whom we ordinarily <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec187.txt')">call</a> Jilts. You cannot possibly go upon a
more useful Work, than the Consideration of these dangerous Animals.
The Coquet is indeed one Degree towards the Jilt; but the <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec187.txt')">Heart</a> of the
former is bent upon admiring her self, and giving false Hopes to her
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec187.txt')">Lovers</a>; but the latter is not contented to be extreamly amiable, but
she must add to that Advantage a certain Delight in being a Torment to
others. Thus when her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec187.txt')">Lover</a> is in the full Expectation of Success, the
Jilt shall meet him with a sudden Indifference, and Admiration in her
Face at his being surprised that he is received like a Stranger, and a
Cast of her Head another Way with a pleasant Scorn of the Fellow's
Insolence. It is very probable the Lover goes home utterly astonished
and dejected, sits down to his Scrutore, sends her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec187.txt')">word</a> in the most
abject Terms, That he knows not what he has done; that all which was
desirable in this Life is so suddenly vanished from him, that the
Charmer of his Soul should withdraw the vital Heat from the Heart
which pants for her. He continues a mournful <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec187.txt')">Absence</a> for some time,
pining in Secret, and out of Humour with all <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec187.txt')">things</a> which he meets
with. At length he takes a Resolution to try his Fate, and explain
with her resolutely upon her unaccountable Carriage. He walks up to
her Apartment, with a thousand Inquietudes and Doubts in what <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec187.txt')">Manner</a>
he shall meet the first Cast of her Eye; when upon his first
Appearance she flies towards him, wonders where he has been, accuses
him of his Absence, and treats him with a Familiarity as surprising as
her former Coldness. This good Correspondence continues till the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec187.txt')">Lady</a>
observes the Lover grows happy in it, and then she interrupts it with
some new Inconsistency of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec187.txt')">Behaviour</a>. For (as I just now said) the
Happiness of a Jilt consists only in the Power of making others
uneasy. But such is the Folly of this Sect of Women, that they carry
on this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec187.txt')">pretty</a> skittish Behaviour, till they have no charms left to
render it supportable. Corinna, that used to torment all who conversed
with her with false Glances, and little heedless unguarded Motions,
that were to betray some Inclination towards the Man she would
ensnare, finds at present all she attempts that way unregarded; and is
obliged to indulge the Jilt in her Constitution, by laying Artificial
Plots, writing perplexing Letters from unknown Hands, and making all
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec187.txt')">young</a> Fellows in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec187.txt')">Love</a> with her, till they find out who she is.
Thus as before she gave Torment by disguising her Inclination, she is
now obliged to do it by hiding her Person.</p><p>As for my own Part, Mr, SPECTATOR, it has been my unhappy Fate to be
jilted from my Youth upward; and as my Taste has been very much
towards Intreague, and having Intelligence with Women of Wit, my whole
Life has passed away in a Series of Impositions. I shall, for the
Benefit of the present Race of young Men, give some Account of my
Loves. I know not whether you have ever heard of the famous Girl about
Town called Kitty: This Creature (for I must take Shame upon my self)
was my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec187.txt')">Mistress</a> in the Days when Keeping was in Fashion. Kitty, under
the Appearance of being Wild, Thoughtless, and Irregular in all her
Words and Actions, concealed the most accomplished Jilt of her Time.
Her Negligence had to me a Charm in it like that of Chastity, and Want
of Desires seemed as <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec187.txt')">great</a> a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec187.txt')">Merit</a> as the Conquest of them. The Air
she gave herself was that of a Romping Girl, and whenever I talked to
her with any Turn of Fondness, she would immediately snatch off my
Perriwig, try it upon herself in the Glass, clap her Arms a Kimbow,
draw my Sword, and make Passes on the Wall, take off my Cravat, and
seize it to make some other Use of the Lace, or run into some other
unaccountable Rompishness, till the Time I had appointed to pass away
with her was over. I went from her full of Pleasure at the Reflection
that I had the keeping of so much <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec187.txt')">Beauty</a> in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec187.txt')">Woman</a>, who, as she was
too heedless to please me, was also too inattentive to form a Design
to wrong me. Long did I divert every Hour that hung heavy upon me in
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec187.txt')">Company</a> of this Creature, whom I looked upon as neither Guilty or
Innocent, but could laugh at my self for my unaccountable Pleasure in
an Expence upon her, till in the End it appeared my pretty Insensible
was with Child by my Footman.</p><p>This Accident roused me into a Disdain against all Libertine Women,
under what Appearance soever they hid their Insincerity, and I
resolved after that Time to converse with none but those who lived
within the Rules of Decency and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec187.txt')">Honour</a>. To this End I formed my self
into a more regular Turn of Behaviour, and began to make Visits,
frequent Assemblies, and lead out <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec187.txt')">Ladies</a> from the Theatres, with all
the other insignificant Duties which the professed Servants of the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec187.txt')">Fair</a> place themselves in constant Readiness to perform. In a very
little time, (having a plentiful Fortune) Fathers and Mothers began to
regard me as a good Match, and I found easie Admittance into the best
Families in Town to observe their daughters; but I, who was born to
follow the Fair to no Purpose, have by the Force of my ill Stars made
my Application to three Jilts successively.</p><p>Hy√¶na is one of those who form themselves into a melancholy and
indolent Air, and endeavour to gain Admirers from their Inattention to
all around them. Hyaena can loll in her Coach, with something so fixed
in her Countenance, that it is impossible to conceive her Meditation
is employed only on her Dress and her Charms in that Posture. If it
were not too coarse a Simile, I should say, Hyaena, in the Figure she
affects to appear in, is a Spider in the midst of a Cobweb, that is
sure to destroy every Fly that approaches it. The Net Hyaena throws is
so fine, that you are taken in it before you can observe any Part of
her Work. I attempted her for a long and weary Season, but I found her
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec187.txt')">Passion</a> went no farther than to be admired; and she is of that
unreasonable Temper, as not to value the Inconstancy of her Lovers
provided she can boast she once had their Addresses.</p><p>Biblis was the second I aimed at, and her Vanity lay in purchasing the
Adorers of others, and not in rejoicing in their Love it self. Biblis
is no Man's Mistress, but every Woman's Rival. As soon as I found
this, I fell in Love with Chloe, who is my present Pleasure and
Torment. I have writ to her, danced with her, and fought for her, and
have been her Man in the Sight and Expectation of the whole Town
[these [1]] three Years, and thought my self near the End of my
Wishes; when the other Day she called me into her Closet, and told me,
with a very grave Face, that she was a Woman of Honour, and scorned to
deceive a Man who loved her with so much Sincerity as she saw I did,
and therefore she must inform me that she was by Nature the most
inconstant Creature breathing, and begg'd of me not to marry her; If I
insisted upon it, I should; but that she was lately fallen in Love
with another. What to do or say I know not, but desire you to inform
me, and you will infinitely oblige,</p><p>SIR, Your most humble Servant,</p><p>Charles Yellow.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: "this", and in first reprint.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT.</p><p>Mr. Sly, Haberdasher of Hats,
at the Corner of Devereux-Court in the Strand,
gives notice,
That he has prepared very neat Hats, Rubbers, and Brushes
for the Use of young Tradesmen in their last Year of Apprenticeship,
at reasonable Rates. [1]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1:</p><p>"Last night died of a mortification in his leg, after a long time
enduring the same, John Sly, the late famous haberdasher, so often
mentioned in the 'Spectator'."</p><p>'Evening Post', April 15, 1729.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
