<p>No. 188.                 Friday, October 5, 1711.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Loetus sum Laudari Ã  te Laudato viro.'</p><p>Tull.</p><p>
He is a very unhappy Man who sets his Heart upon being admired by the
Multitude, or affects a general and undistinguishing Applause among Men.
What pious Men <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec188.txt')">call</a> the Testimony of a good Conscience, should be the
Measure of our <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec188.txt')">Ambition</a> in this Kind; that is to say, a Man of Spirit
should contemn the Praise of the Ignorant, and like being applauded for
nothing but what he knows in his own Heart he deserves. Besides which
the Character of the Person who commends you is to be considered, before
you set a Value upon his Esteem. The Praise of an ignorant Man is only
Good-will, and you should receive his Kindness as he is a good Neighbour
in Society, and not as a good Judge of your <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec188.txt')">Actions</a> in Point of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec188.txt')">Fame</a> and
Reputation. The Satyrist said very well of popular Praise and
Acclamations, Give the Tinkers and Coblers their Presents again, and
learn to live of your self. [1] It is an Argument of a loose and
ungoverned Mind to be affected with the promiscuous Approbation of the
Generality of Mankind; and a Man of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec188.txt')">Virtue</a> should be too delicate for so
coarse an Appetite of Fame. Men of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec188.txt')">Honour</a> should endeavour only to
please the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec188.txt')">Worthy</a>, and the Man of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec188.txt')">Merit</a> should desire to be tried only
by his Peers. I thought it a noble Sentiment which I heard Yesterday
uttered in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec188.txt')">Conversation</a>; I know, said a Gentleman, a Way to be greater
than any Man: If he has Worth in him, I can rejoice in his Superiority
to me; and that Satisfaction is a greater Act of the Soul in me, than
any in him which can possibly appear to me. This Thought could not
proceed but from a candid and generous Spirit; and the Approbation of
such Minds is what may be esteemed true Praise. For with the common Rate
of Men there is nothing commendable but what they themselves may hope to
be Partakers of, or arrive at; but the Motive truly glorious is, when
the Mind is set rather to do <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec188.txt')">Things</a> laudable, than to purchase
Reputation. Where there is that Sincerity as the Foundation of a good
Name, the kind Opinion of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec188.txt')">virtuous</a> Men will be an unsought but a
necessary Consequence. The Lacedemonians, tho' a plain <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec188.txt')">People</a>, and no
Pretenders to Politeness, had a certain Delicacy in their Sense of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec188.txt')">Glory</a>, and sacrificed to the Muses when they entered upon any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec188.txt')">great</a>
Enterprise. [2] They would have the Commemoration of their Actions be
transmitted by the purest and most untainted Memorialists. The Din which
attends Victories and publick Triumphs is by far less eligible, than the
Recital of the Actions of great Men by honest and wise Historians. It is
a frivolous Pleasure to be the Admiration of gaping Crowds; but to have
the Approbation of a good Man in the cool Reflections of his Closet, is
a Gratification worthy an heroick Spirit. The Applause of the Crowd
makes the Head giddy, but the Attestation of a reasonable Man makes the
Heart glad.</p><p>What makes the Love of popular or general Praise still more ridiculous,
is, that it is usually given for Circumstances which are foreign to the
Persons admired. Thus they are the ordinary Attendants on Power and
Riches, which may be taken out of one Man's Hands, and put into
another's: The Application only, and not the Possession, makes those
outward things honourable. The Vulgar and Men of Sense agree in admiring
Men for having what they themselves would rather be possessed of; the
wise Man applauds him whom he thinks most virtuous; the rest of the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec188.txt')">World</a>, him who is most wealthy.</p><p>When a Man is in this way of Thinking, I do not know what can occur to
one more monstrous, than to see Persons of Ingenuity address their
Services and Performances to Men no way addicted to Liberal Arts: In
these Cases, the Praise on one hand, and the Patronage on the other, are
equally the Objects of Ridicule. Dedications to ignorant Men are as
absurd as any of the Speeches of Bulfinch in the Droll: Such an Address
one is apt to translate into other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec188.txt')">Words</a>; and when the Different Parties
are thoroughly considered, the Panegyrick generally implies no more than
if the Author should say to the Patron; My very good Lord, You and I can
never understand one another, therefore I humbly desire we may be
intimate Friends for the future.</p><p>The Rich may as well ask to borrow of the Poor, as the Man of Virtue or
Merit hope for Addition to his Character from any but such as himself.
He that commends another engages so much of his own Reputation as he
gives to that Person commended; and he that has nothing laudable in
himself is not of Ability to be such a Surety. The wise Phocion was so
sensible how dangerous it was to be touched with what the Multitude
approved, that upon a general Acclamation made when he was making an
Oration, he turned to an intelligent <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec188.txt')">Friend</a> who stood near him, and
asked, in a surprized <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec188.txt')">Manner</a>, What Slip have I made? [3]</p><p>I shall conclude this Paper with a Billet which has fallen into my
Hands, and was written to a Lady from a Gentleman whom she had highly
commended. The Author of it had formerly been her Lover. When all
Possibility of Commerce between them on the Subject of Love was cut off,
she spoke so handsomely of him, as to give Occasion for this Letter.</p><p>
Madam,</p><p>"I should be insensible to a Stupidity, if I could forbear making you
my Acknowledgments for your late mention of me with so much Applause.
It is, I think, your Fate to give me new Sentiments; as you formerly
inspired me with the true Sense of Love, so do you now with the true
Sense of Glory. As Desire had the least Part in the Passion I
heretofore professed towards you, so has Vanity no Share in the Glory
to which you have now raised me. Innocence, Knowledge, Beauty, Virtue,
Sincerity, and Discretion, are the constant Ornaments of her who has
said this of me. Fame is a Babbler, but I have arrived at the highest
Glory in this World, the Commendation of the most deserving Person in
it."</p><p>
