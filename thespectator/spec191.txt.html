<p>No. 191.               Tuesday, October 9, 1711.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>[Greek: ... oulon oneiron.]</p><p>
Some ludicrous Schoolmen have put the Case, that if an Ass were placed
between two Bundles of Hay, which affected his Senses equally on each
Side, and tempted him in the very same Degree, whether it would be
possible for him to Eat of either. They generally determine this
Question to the Disadvantage of the Ass, who they say would starve in
the Midst of Plenty, as not having a single Grain of Freewill to
determine him more to the one than to the other. The Bundle of Hay on
either Side striking his Sight and Smell in the same Proportion, would
keep him in a perpetual Suspence, like the two Magnets which, Travellers
have told us, are placed one of them in the Roof, and the other in the
Floor of Mahomet's Burying-place at Mecca, and by that means, say they,
pull the Impostor's Iron Coffin with such an equal Attraction, that it
hangs in the Air between both of them. As for the Ass's <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec191.txt')">Behaviour</a> in
such nice Circumstances, whether he would Starve sooner than violate his
Neutrality to the two Bundles of Hay, I shall not presume to determine;
but only take Notice of the Conduct of our own Species in the same
Perplexity. When a Man has a mind to venture his <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec191.txt')">Money</a> in a Lottery,
every Figure of it appears equally alluring, and as likely to succeed as
any of its Fellows. They all of them have the same Pretensions to good
Luck, stand upon the same foot of Competition, and no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec191.txt')">manner</a> of Reason
can be given why a Man should prefer one to the other before the Lottery
is drawn. In this Case therefore Caprice very often acts in the Place of
Reason, and forms to it self some Groundless Imaginary Motive, where
real and substantial ones are wanting. I know a well-meaning Man that is
very well pleased to risque his good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec191.txt')">Fortune</a> upon the Number 1711,
because it is the Year of our Lord. I am acquainted with a Tacker that
would give a good deal for the Number 134. [1] On the contrary I have
been told of a certain Zealous Dissenter, who being a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec191.txt')">great</a> Enemy to
Popery, and believing that bad Men are the most fortunate in this World,
will lay two to one on the Number [666 [2]] against any other Number,
because, says he, it is the Number of the Beast. Several would prefer
the Number 12000 before any other, as it is the Number of the Pounds in
the great Prize. In short, some are pleased to find their own Age in
their Number; some that they have got a number which makes a pretty
Appearance in the Cyphers, and others, because it is the same Number
that succeeded in the last Lottery. Each of these, upon no other
Grounds, thinks he stands fairest for the great Lot, and that he is
possessed of what may not be improperly called the Golden Number.</p><p>These Principles of Election are the Pastimes and Extravagancies of
Human Reason, which is of so busie a Nature, that it will be exerting it
self in the meanest Trifles and working even when it wants Materials.
The wisest of Men are sometimes acted by such unaccountable Motives, as
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec191.txt')">Life</a> of the Fool and the Superstitious is guided by nothing else.</p><p>I am surprized that none of the Fortune-tellers, or, as the French <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec191.txt')">call</a>
them, the Diseurs de bonne Avanture, who Publish their Bills in every
Quarter of the Town, have not turned our Lotteries to their Advantage;
did any of them set up for a Caster of fortunate Figures, what might he
not get by his pretended Discoveries and Predictions?</p><p>I remember among the Advertisements in the Post-Boy of September the
27th, I was surprized to see the following one:</p><p>This is to give notice, That Ten Shillings over and above the
Market-<a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec191.txt')">Price</a>, will be given for the Ticket in the Â£1 500 000 Lottery,
No. 132, by Nath. Cliff at the Bible and Three Crowns in Cheapside.</p><p>This Advertisement has given great Matter of Speculation to Coffee-house
Theorists. Mr. Cliff's Principles and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec191.txt')">Conversation</a> have been canvassed
upon this Occasion, and various Conjectures made why he should thus set
his Heart upon Number 132. I have examined all the Powers in those
Numbers, broken them into Fractions, extracted the Square and Cube Root,
divided and multiplied them all Ways, but could not arrive at the Secret
till about three Days ago, when I received the following Letter from an
unknown Hand, by which I find that Mr. Nathaniel Cliff is only the
Agent, and not the Principal, in this Advertisement.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I am the Person that lately advertised I would give ten Shillings
more than the current Price for the Ticket No. 132 in the Lottery now
drawing; which is a Secret I have communicated to some Friends, who
rally me incessantly upon that Account. You must know I have but one
Ticket, for which Reason, and a certain Dream I have lately had more
than once, I was resolved it should be the Number I most approved. I
am so positive I have pitched upon the great Lot, that I could almost
lay all I am worth of it. My Visions are so frequent and strong upon
this Occasion, that I have not only possessed the Lot, but disposed of
the Money which in all probability it will sell for. This Morning, in
particular, I set up an Equipage which I look upon to be the gayest in
the Town. The Liveries are very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec191.txt')">Rich</a>, but not Gaudy. I should be very
glad to see a Speculation or two upon lottery Subjects, in which you
would oblige all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec191.txt')">People</a> concerned, and in particular</p><p>'Your most humble Servant,</p><p>'George Gossling.</p><p>'P.S. Dear SPEC, if I get the 12 000 Pound, I'll make thee a handsome
Present.'</p><p>
After having wished my Correspondent good Luck, and thanked him for his
intended Kindness, I shall for this time dismiss the Subject of the
Lottery, and only observe that the greatest Part of Mankind are in some
degree guilty of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec191.txt')">Friend</a> Gossling's Extravagance. We are apt to rely
upon future Prospects, and become really expensive while we are only
rich in Possibility. We live up to our Expectations, not to our
Possessions, and make a Figure proportionable to what we may be, not
what we are. We out-run our present Income, as not doubting to disburse
our selves out of the Profits of some future Place, Project, or
Reversion, that we have in view. It is through this Temper of Mind,
which is so common among us, that we see Tradesmen break, who have met
with no Misfortunes in their Business; and Men of Estates reduced to
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec191.txt')">Poverty</a>, who have never suffered from Losses or Repairs, Tenants, Taxes,
or Law-suits. In short, it is this foolish sanguine Temper, this
depending upon Contingent Futurities, that occasions Romantick
Generosity, Chymerical Grandeur, Senseless Ostentation, and generally
ends in Beggary and Ruin. The Man, who will live above his present
Circumstances, is in great Danger of living in a little time much
beneath them, or, as the Italian Proverb runs, The Man who lives by Hope
will die by Hunger.</p><p>It should be an indispensable Rule in Life, to contract our Desires to
our present Condition, and whatever may be our Expectations, to live
within the compass of what we actually possess. It will be Time enough
to enjoy an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec191.txt')">Estate</a> when it comes into our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec191.txt')">Hands</a>; but if we anticipate
our good Fortune, we shall lose the Pleasure of it when it arrives, and
may possibly never possess what we have so foolishly counted upon.</p><p>L.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: The number of the minority who were in 1704 for Tacking a
