<p>No. 196.               Monday, October 15, 1711.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit oequus.</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'There is a particular Fault which I have observed in most of the
Moralists in all Ages, and that is, that they are always professing
themselves, and teaching others to be happy. This State is not to be
arrived at in this <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec196.txt')">Life</a>, therefore I would recommend to you to talk in
an humbler Strain than your Predecessors have done, and instead of
presuming to be happy, instruct us only to be easy. The Thoughts of
him who would be discreet, and aim at practicable things, should turn
upon allaying our Pain rather than promoting our Joy. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec196.txt')">Great</a> Inquietude
is to be avoided, but great Felicity is not to be attained. The great
Lesson is Ã†quanimity, a Regularity of Spirit, which is a little above
Chearfulness and below Mirth. Chearfulness is always to be supported
if a Man is out of Pain, but Mirth to a prudent Man should always be
accidental: It should naturally arise out of the Occasion, and the
Occasion seldom be laid for it; for those Tempers who want Mirth to be
pleased, are like the Constitutions which flag without the use of
Brandy. Therefore, I say, let your Precept be, Be easy. That Mind is
dissolute and ungoverned, which must be hurried out of it self by loud
Laughter or sensual Pleasure, or else [be [1]] wholly unactive.</p><p>There are a Couple of old Fellows of my Acquaintance who meet every
Day and smoak a Pipe, and by their mutual <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec196.txt')">Love</a> to each other, tho'
they have been Men of Business and Bustle in the World, enjoy a
greater Tranquility than either could have worked himself into by any
Chapter of Seneca. Indolence of Body and Mind, when we aim at no more,
is very frequently enjoyed; but the very Enquiry after Happiness has
something restless in it, which a Man who lives in a Series of
temperate Meals, friendly Conversations, and easy Slumbers, gives
himself no Trouble about. While Men of Refinement are talking of
Tranquility, he possesses it.</p><p>What I would by these broken Expressions recommend to you, Mr.
SPECTATOR, is, that you would <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec196.txt')">speak</a> of the Way of Life, which plain
Men may pursue, to fill up the Spaces of Time with Satisfaction. It is
a lamentable Circumstance, that Wisdom, or, as you <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec196.txt')">call</a> it,
Philosophy, should furnish Ideas only for the Learned; and that a Man
must be a Philosopher to know how to pass away his Time agreeably. It
would therefore be worth your Pains to place in an handsome Light the
Relations and Affinities among Men, which render their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec196.txt')">Conversation</a>
with each other so grateful, that the highest Talents give but an
impotent Pleasure in Comparison with them. You may find Descriptions
and Discourses which will render the Fire-side of an honest Artificer
as entertaining as your own Club is to you. Good-nature has an endless
Source of Pleasure in it; and the Representation of domestick Life,
filled with its natural Gratifications, (instead of the necessary
Vexations which are generally insisted upon in the Writings of the
Witty) will be a very good Office to Society.</p><p>The Vicissitudes of Labour and Rest in the lower Part of Mankind, make
their Being pass away with that Sort of Relish which we express by the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec196.txt')">Word</a> Comfort; and should be treated of by you, who are a SPECTATOR, as
well as such Subjects which appear indeed more speculative, but are
less instructive. In a word, Sir, I would have you turn your Thoughts
to the Advantage of such as want you most; and shew that Simplicity,
Innocence, Industry and Temperance, are Arts which lead to
Tranquility, as much as Learning, Wisdom, Knowledge, and
Contemplation.</p><p>I am, Sir,</p><p>Your most Humble Servant,</p><p>'T. B.'</p><p></p><p>
Hackney, [October 12. [2]]</p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I am the <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec196.txt')">young</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec196.txt')">Woman</a> whom you did so much Justice to some time ago,
in acknowledging that I am perfect Mistress of the Fan, and use it
with the utmost Knowledge and Dexterity. Indeed the World, as
malicious as it is, will allow, that from an Hurry of Laughter I
recollect my self the most suddenly, make a Curtesie, and let fall my
Hands before me, closing my Fan at the same instant, the best of any
Woman in England. I am not a little delighted that I have had your
Notice and Approbation; and however other young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec196.txt')">Women</a> may rally me out
of Envy, I triumph in it, and demand a Place in your Friendship. You
must therefore permit me to lay before you the present State of my
Mind. I was reading your Spectator of the 9th Instant, and thought the
Circumstance of the Ass divided between two Bundles of Hay which
equally affected his Senses, was a lively Representation of my present
Condition: For you are to now that I am extremely enamoured with two
young Gentlemen who at this time pretend to me. One must hide nothing
when one is asking Advice, therefore I will own to you, that I am very
amorous and very covetous. My Lover _Will_ is very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec196.txt')">rich</a>, and my
Lover _Tom_ very handsome. I can have either of them when I
please; but when I debate the Question in my own Mind, I cannot take
_Tom_ for fear of losing _Will_'s <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec196.txt')">Estate</a>, nor enter upon
_Will's_ Estate, and bid adieu to _Tom_'s Person. I am very
young, and yet no one in the World, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec196.txt')">dear</a> Sir, has the main Chance more
in her Head than myself. _Tom_ is the gayest, the blithest
Creature! He dances well, is very civil, and diverting at all Hours
and Seasons. Oh, he is the Joy of my Eyes! But then again _Will_
is so very rich and careful of the Main. How many <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec196.txt')">pretty</a> Dresses does
_Tom_ appear in to charm me! But then it immediately occurs to
me, that a Man of his Circumstances is so much the poorer. Upon the
whole I have at last examined both these Desires of Loves and Avarice,
and upon strictly weighing the Matter I begin to think I shall be
covetous longer than fond; therefore if you have nothing to say to the
contrary, I shall take _Will_. Alas, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec196.txt')">poor</a> _Tom_!</p><p>_Your Humble Servant_,
BIDDY LOVELESS.</p><p>
