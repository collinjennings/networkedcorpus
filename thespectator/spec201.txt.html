'Religentem esse oportet, Religiosum nefas.'</p><p>Incerti Autoris apud Aul. Gell.</p><p>
It is of the last Importance to season the <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec201.txt')">Passions</a> of a Child with
<a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec201.txt')">Devotion</a>, which seldom dies in a Mind that has received an early
Tincture of it. Though it may seem extinguished for a while by the Cares
of the <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec201.txt')">World</a>, the Heats of Youth, or the Allurements of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec201.txt')">Vice</a>, it
generally breaks out and discovers it self again as soon as Discretion,
Consideration, Age, or Misfortunes have brought the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec201.txt')">Man</a> to himself. The
Fire may be covered and overlaid, but cannot be entirely quenched and
smothered.</p><p>A State of Temperance, Sobriety, and Justice, without Devotion, is a
cold, lifeless, insipid Condition of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec201.txt')">Virtue</a>; and is rather to be styled
Philosophy than <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec201.txt')">Religion</a>. Devotion opens the Mind to <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec201.txt')">great</a> Conceptions,
and fills it with more sublime Ideas than any that are to be met with in
the most exalted Science; and at the same time warms and agitates the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec201.txt')">Soul</a> more than sensual Pleasure.</p><p>It has been observed by some Writers, that Man is more distinguished
from the Animal World by Devotion than by <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec201.txt')">Reason</a>, as several Brute
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec201.txt')">Creatures</a> discover in their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec201.txt')">Actions</a> something like a faint Glimmering of
Reason, though they betray in no single Circumstance of their Behaviour
any Thing that bears the least Affinity to Devotion. It is certain, the
Propensity of the Mind to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec201.txt')">Religious</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec201.txt')">Worship</a>; the natural Tendency of the
Soul to fly to some Superior Being for Succour in Dangers and
Distresses, the Gratitude to an invisible Superintendent [which [1]]
rises in us upon receiving any extraordinary and unexpected good
Fortune; the Acts of Love and Admiration with which the Thoughts of Men
are so wonderfully transported in meditating upon the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec201.txt')">Divine</a>
Perfections, and the universal Concurrence of all the Nations under
Heaven in the great Article of Adoration, plainly shew that Devotion or
Religious Worship must be the Effect of Tradition from some first
Founder of Mankind, or that it is conformable to the Natural Light of
Reason, or that it proceeds from an Instinct implanted in the Soul it
self. For my part, I look upon all these to be the concurrent Causes,
but which ever of them shall be assigned as the Principle of Divine
Worship, it manifestly points to a Supreme Being as the first Author of
it.</p><p>I may take some other Opportunity of considering those particular Forms
and Methods of Devotion which are taught us by Christianity, but shall
here observe into what Errors even this Divine Principle may sometimes
lead us, when it is not moderated by that right Reason which was given
us as the Guide of all our Actions.</p><p>The two great Errors into which a mistaken Devotion may betray us, are
Enthusiasm and Superstition.</p><p>There is not a more melancholy Object than a Man who has his Head turned
with Religious Enthusiasm. A Person that is crazed, tho' with Pride or
Malice, is a Sight very mortifying to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec201.txt')">Human</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec201.txt')">Nature</a>; but when the
Distemper arises from any indiscreet Fervours of Devotion, or too
intense an Application of the Mind to its mistaken Duties, it deserves
our Compassion in a more particular Manner. We may however learn this
Lesson from it, that since Devotion it self (which one would be apt to
think could not be too warm) may disorder the Mind, unless its Heats are
tempered with Caution and Prudence, we should be particularly careful to
keep our Reason as cool as possible, and to guard our selves in all
Parts of Life against the Influence of Passion, Imagination, and
Constitution.</p><p>Devotion, when it does not lie under the Check of Reason, is very apt to
degenerate into Enthusiasm. When the Mind finds herself very much
inflamed with her Devotions, she is too much inclined to think they are
not of her own kindling, but blown up by something Divine within her. If
she indulges this Thought too far, and humours the growing Passion, she
at last flings her self into imaginary Raptures and Extasies; and when
once she fancies her self under the Influence of a Divine Impulse, it is
no Wonder if she slights Human Ordinances, and refuses to comply with
any established Form of Religion, as thinking her self directed by a
much superior Guide.</p><p>As Enthusiasm is a kind of Excess in Devotion, Superstition is the
Excess not only of Devotion, but of Religion in general, according to an
old Heathen Saying, quoted by _Aulus Gellius_, _Religentem esse oportet,
Religiosum nefas_; A Man should be Religious, not Superstitious: For as
the Author tells us, _Nigidius_ observed upon this Passage, that the
_Latin_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec201.txt')">Words</a> which terminate in _osus_ generally imply <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec201.txt')">vicious</a>
Characters, and the having of any Quality to an Excess. [2]</p><p>An Enthusiast in Religion is like an obstinate Clown, a Superstitious
Man like an insipid Courtier. Enthusiasm has something in it of Madness,
Superstition of Folly. Most of the Sects that fall short of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec201.txt')">Church</a>
of _England_ have in them strong Tinctures of Enthusiasm, as the _Roman_
Catholick Religion is one huge overgrown <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec201.txt')">Body</a> of childish and idle
Superstitions.</p><p>The _Roman_ Catholick Church seems indeed irrecoverably lost in this
Particular. If an absurd Dress or Behaviour be introduced in the World,
it will soon be found out and discarded: On the contrary, a Habit or
Ceremony, tho' never so ridiculous, [which [3]] has taken Sanctuary in
the Church, sticks in it for ever. A _Gothic_ Bishop perhaps, thought it
proper to repeat such a Form in such particular Shoes or Slippers;
another fancied it would be very decent if such a Part of publick
Devotions were performed with a Mitre on his Head, and a Crosier in his
Hand: To this a Brother _Vandal_, as wise as the others, adds an antick
Dress, which he conceived would allude very aptly to such and such
Mysteries, till by Degrees the whole Office [has] degenerated into an
empty Show.</p><p>Their Successors see the Vanity and Inconvenience of these Ceremonies;
but instead of reforming, perhaps add others, which they think more
significant, and which take Possession in the same manner, and are never
to be driven out after they have been once admitted. I have seen the
Pope officiate at St. _Peter's_ where, for two Hours together, he was
busied in putting on or off his different Accoutrements, according to
the different Parts he was to act in them.</p><p>Nothing is so glorious in the Eyes of Mankind, and ornamental to Human
Nature, setting aside the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec201.txt')">infinite</a> Advantages [which [4]] arise from it,
as a strong, steady masculine Piety; but Enthusiasm and Superstition are
the Weaknesses of human Reason, that expose us to the Scorn and Derision
of Infidels, and sink us even below the Beasts that perish.</p><p>Idolatry may be looked upon as another Error arising from mistaken
Devotion; but because Reflections on that Subject would be of no use to
an _English_ Reader, I shall not enlarge upon it.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: that]</p><p>
