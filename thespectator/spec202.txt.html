<p>No. 202.              Monday, October 22, 1711.               Steele.</p><p>
'SÃ¦pe decem vitiis instructior odit et horret.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
The other Day as I passed along the Street, I saw a sturdy Prentice-Boy
Disputing with an Hackney-Coachman; and in an Instant, upon some <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec202.txt')">Word</a> of
Provocation, throw off his Hat and [Cut-Periwig, [1]] clench his Fist,
and strike the Fellow a Slap on the Face; at the same time calling him
Rascal, and telling him he was a Gentleman's Son. The young Gentleman
was, it seems, bound to a Blacksmith; and the Debate arose about Payment
for some Work done about a Coach, near which they Fought. His Master,
during the Combat, was full of his Boy's Praises; and as he called to
him to play with his Hand and Foot, and throw in his Head, he made all
us who stood round him of his Party, by declaring the Boy had very good
Friends, and he could trust him with untold Gold. As I am generally in
the Theory of Mankind, I could not but make my Reflections upon the
sudden Popularity which was raised about the Lad; and perhaps, with my
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec202.txt')">Friend</a> _Tacitus_, fell into Observations upon it, which were too <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec202.txt')">great</a>
for the Occasion; or ascribed this general Favour to Causes which had
nothing to do towards it. But the young Blacksmith's being a Gentleman
was, methought, what created him good Will from his present Equality
with the Mob about him: Add to this, that he was not so much a
Gentleman, as not, at the same time that he called himself such, to use
as rough Methods for his Defence as his Antagonist. The Advantage of his
having good Friends, as his Master expressed it, was not lazily urged;
but he shewed himself superior to the Coachman in the personal Qualities
of Courage and Activity, to confirm that of his being well allied,
before his Birth was of any Service to him.</p><p>If one might Moralize from this silly Story, a Man would say, that
whatever Advantages of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec202.txt')">Fortune</a>, Birth, or any other Good, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec202.txt')">People</a> possess
above the rest of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec202.txt')">World</a>, they should shew collateral Eminences
besides those Distinctions; or those Distinctions will avail only to
keep up common Decencies and Ceremonies, and not to preserve a real
Place of Favour or Esteem in the Opinion and common Sense of their
Fellow-Creatures.</p><p>The Folly of People's Procedure, in imagining that nothing more is
necessary than Property and superior Circumstances to support them in
Distinction, appears in no way so much as in the Domestick part of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec202.txt')">Life</a>.
It is ordinary to feed their Humours into unnatural Excrescences, if I
may so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec202.txt')">speak</a>, and make their whole Being a wayward and uneasy Condition,
for want of the obvious Reflection that all Parts of Human Life is a
Commerce. It is not only paying Wages, and giving Commands, that
constitutes a Master of a Family; but Prudence, equal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec202.txt')">Behaviour</a>, with
Readiness to protect and cherish them, is what entitles a Man to that
Character in their very Hearts and Sentiments. It is pleasant enough to
Observe, that Men expect from their Dependants, from their sole Motive
of Fear, all the good Effects which a liberal Education, and affluent
Fortune, and every other Advantage, cannot produce in themselves. A Man
will have his Servant just, diligent, sober and chaste, for no other
Reasons but the Terrour of losing his Master's Favour; when all the Laws
Divine and Human cannot keep him whom he serves within Bounds, with
relation to any one of those Virtues. But both in great and ordinary
Affairs, all Superiority, which is not founded on <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec202.txt')">Merit</a> and Virtue, is
supported only by Artifice and Stratagem. Thus you see Flatterers are
the Agents in Families of Humourists, and those who govern themselves by
any thing but Reason. Make-Bates, distant Relations, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec202.txt')">poor</a> Kinsmen, and
indigent Followers, are the Fry which support the Oeconomy of an
humoursome <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec202.txt')">rich</a> Man. He is eternally whispered with Intelligence of who
are true or false to him in Matters of no Consequence, and he maintains
twenty Friends to defend him against the Insinuations of one who would
perhaps cheat him of an old Coat.</p><p>I shall not enter into farther Speculation upon this Subject at present,
but think the following Letters and Petition are made up of proper
Sentiments on this Occasion.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a Servant to an old Lady who is governed by one she calls her
Friend; who is so familiar an one, that she takes upon her to advise
her without being called to it, and makes her uneasie with all about
her. Pray, Sir, be pleased to give us some Remarks upon voluntary
Counsellors; and let these People know that to give any Body Advice,
is to say to that Person, I am your Betters. Pray, Sir, as near as you
can, describe that eternal Flirt and Disturber of Families, Mrs.
_Taperty_, who is always visiting, and putting People in a Way, as
they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec202.txt')">call</a> it. If you can make her stay at home one Evening, you will
be a general Benefactor to all the Ladies Women in Town, and
particularly to</p><p>_Your loving Friend_,</p><p>Susan Civil.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I am a Footman, and live with one of those Men, each of whom is said
to be one of the best humoured Men in the World, but that he is
passionate. Pray be pleased to inform them, that he who is passionate,
and takes no Care to command his Hastiness, does more Injury to his
Friends and Servants in one half Hour, than whole Years can attone
for. This Master of mine, who is the best Man alive in common <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec202.txt')">Fame</a>,
disobliges Some body every Day he lives; and strikes me for the next
thing I do, because he is out of Humour at it. If these Gentlemen
[knew [2]] that they do all the Mischief that is ever done in
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec202.txt')">Conversation</a>, they would reform; and I who have been a Spectator of
Gentlemen at Dinner for many Years, have seen that Indiscretion does
ten times more Mischief than Ill-nature. But you will represent this
better than _Your abused_</p><p>_Humble Servant_,</p><p>Thomas Smoaky.</p><p></p><p>_To the_ SPECTATOR,</p><p>The humble Petition of _John Steward_, _Robert Butler_, _Harry Cook_,
and _Abigail Chambers_, in Behalf of themselves and their Relations,
belonging to and dispersed in the several Services of most of the
great Families within the Cities of _London and Westminster_;</p><p>Sheweth,</p><p>That in many of the Families in which your Petitioners live and are
employed, the several Heads of them are wholly unacquainted with what
is Business, and are very little Judges when they are well or ill used
by us your said Petitioners.</p><p>That for want of such Skill in their own Affairs, and by Indulgence
of their own Laziness and Pride, they continually keep about them
certain mischievous Animals called Spies.</p><p>That whenever a Spy is entertained, the Peace of that House is from
that Moment banished.</p><p>That Spies never give an Account of good Services, but represent our
Mirth and Freedom by the Words Wantonness and Disorder.</p><p>That in all Families where there are Spies, there is a general
Jealousy and Misunderstanding.</p><p>That the Masters and Mistresses of such Houses live in continual
Suspicion of their ingenuous and true Servants, and are given up to
the Management of those who are false and perfidious.</p><p>That such Masters and Mistresses who entertain Spies, are no longer
more than Cyphers in their own Families; and that we your Petitioners
are with great Disdain obliged to pay all our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec202.txt')">Respect</a>, and expect all
our Maintenance from such Spies.</p><p>Your Petitioners therefore most humbly pray, that you would represent
the Premises to all Persons of Condition; and your Petitioners, as in
Duty bound, shall for ever Pray, &c.</p><p>
