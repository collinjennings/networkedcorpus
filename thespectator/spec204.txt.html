<p>No. 204.              Wednesday, October 24, 1711.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>Urit grata protervitas,
Et vultus nimium lubric√πs aspici.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I am not at all displeased that I am become the Courier of <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec204.txt')">Love</a>, and
that the Distressed in that Passion convey their Complaints to each
other by my Means. The following Letters have lately come to my hands,
and shall have their Place with great Willingness. As to the Readers
Entertainment, he will, I hope, forgive the inserting such Particulars
as to him may perhaps seem frivolous, but are to the Persons who wrote
them of the highest Consequence. I shall not trouble you with the
Prefaces, Compliments, and Apologies made to me before each Epistle when
it was desired to be inserted; but in general they tell me, that the
Persons to whom they are addressed have Intimations, by Phrases and
Allusions in them, from whence they came.</p><p>_To the_ Sothades [1].</p><p>"The <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec204.txt')">Word</a>, by which I address you, gives you, who understand
_Portuguese_, a lively Image of the tender Regard I have for you. The
SPECTATOR'S late Letter from _Statira_ gave me the Hint to use the
same Method of explaining my self to you. I am not affronted at the
Design your late <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec204.txt')">Behaviour</a> discovered you had in your Addresses to me;
but I impute it to the Degeneracy of the Age, rather than your
particular Fault. As I aim at nothing more than being yours, I am
willing to be a Stranger to your Name, your Fortune, or any Figure
which your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec204.txt')">Wife</a> might expect to make in the World, provided my
Commerce with you is not to be a <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec204.txt')">guilty</a> one. I resign gay Dress, the
Pleasure of Visits, Equipage, Plays, Balls, and Operas, for that one
Satisfaction of having you for ever mine. I am willing you shall
industriously conceal the only Cause of Triumph which I can know in
this Life. I wish only to have it my Duty, as well as my Inclination,
to study your Happiness. If this has not the Effect this Letter seems
to aim at, you are to understand that I had a mind to be rid of you,
and took the readiest Way to pall you with an Offer of what you would
never desist pursuing while you received <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec204.txt')">ill</a> Usage. Be a true Man; be
my Slave while you doubt me, and neglect me when you think I love you.
I defy you to find out what is your present Circumstance with me; but
I know while I can keep this Suspence.</p><p>_I am your admired_ Belinda."</p><p></p><p>_Madam_,</p><p>"It is a strange State of Mind a Man is in, when the very
Imperfections of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec204.txt')">Woman</a> he loves turn into Excellencies and
Advantages. I do assure you, I am very much afraid of venturing upon
you. I now like you in spite of my Reason, and think it an ill
Circumstance to owe ones Happiness to nothing but Infatuation. I can
see you ogle all the young Fellows who look at you, and observe your
Eye wander after new Conquests every Moment you are in a publick
Place; and yet there is such a Beauty in all your Looks and Gestures,
that I cannot but admire you in the very Act of endeavouring to gain
the Hearts of others. My Condition is the same with that of the Lover
in the _Way of the World_, [2] I have studied your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec204.txt')">Faults</a> so long,
that they are become as familiar to me, and I like them as well as I
do my own. Look to it, Madam, and consider whether you think this gay
Behaviour will appear to me as amiable when an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec204.txt')">Husband</a>, as it does now
to me a Lover. Things are so far advanced, that we must proceed; and I
hope you will lay it to <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec204.txt')">Heart</a>, that it will be becoming in me to
appear still your Lover, but not in you to be still my Mistress.
Gaiety in the Matrimonial Life is graceful in one Sex, but
exceptionable in the other. As you improve these little Hints, you
will ascertain the Happiness or Uneasiness of,
_Madam,
Your most obedient,
Most humble Servant_,
T.D."</p><p></p><p>_SIR_,
When I sat at the Window, and you at the other End of the Room by my
Cousin, I saw you catch me looking at you. Since you have the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec204.txt')">Secret</a>
at last, which I am sure you should never have known but by
Inadvertency, what my Eyes said was true. But it is too soon to
confirm it with my Hand, therefore shall not subscribe my Name.</p><p></p><p>_SIR_,
There were other Gentlemen nearer, and I know no Necessity you were
under to take up that flippant Creatures Fan last Night; but you
shall never touch a Stick of mine more, that's pos.
_Phillis_.</p><p></p><p>To Colonel R----s [3] in Spain.</p><p>Before this can reach the best of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec204.txt')">Husbands</a> and the fondest Lover,
those tender Names will be no more of Concern to me. The Indisposition
in which you, to obey the Dictates of your Honour and Duty, left me,
has increased upon me; and I am acquainted by my Physicians I cannot
live a Week longer. At this time my Spirits fail me; and it is the
ardent Love I have for you that carries me beyond my Strength, and
enables me to tell you, the most painful Thing in the Prospect of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec204.txt')">Death</a>, is, that I must part with you. But let it be a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec204.txt')">Comfort</a> to you,
that I have no Guilt hangs upon me, no unrepented Folly that retards
me; but I pass away my last Hours in Reflection upon the Happiness we
have lived in together, and in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec204.txt')">Sorrow</a> that it is so soon to have an
End. This is a Frailty which I hope is so far from <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec204.txt')">criminal</a>, that
methinks there is a kind of Piety in being so unwilling to be
separated from a State which is the Institution of Heaven, and in
which we have lived according to its Laws. As we know no more of the
next Life, but that it will be an happy one to the Good, and miserable
to the Wicked, why may we not please ourselves at least, to alleviate
the Difficulty of resigning this Being, in imagining that we shall
have a Sense of what passes below, and may possibly be employed in
guiding the Steps of those with whom we walked with Innocence when
mortal? Why may not I hope to go on in my usual Work, and, tho
unknown to you, be assistant in all the Conflicts of your Mind? Give
me leave to say to you, O best of Men, that I cannot figure to myself
a greater Happiness than in such an Employment: To be present at all
the Adventures to which human Life is exposed, to administer Slumber
to thy Eyelids in the Agonies of a Fever, to cover thy beloved Face in
the Day of Battle, to go with thee a Guardian Angel incapable of Wound
or Pain, where I have longed to attend thee when a weak, a fearful
Woman: These, my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec204.txt')">Dear</a>, are the Thoughts with which I warm my poor
languid Heart; but indeed I am not capable under my present Weakness
of bearing the strong Agonies of Mind I fall into, when I form to
myself the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec204.txt')">Grief</a> you will be in upon your first hearing of my
Departure. I will not dwell upon this, because your kind and generous
Heart will be but the more afflicted, the more the Person for whom you
lament offers you Consolation. My last Breath will, if I am my self,
expire in a Prayer for you. I shall never see thy Face again.</p><p>Farewell for ever. T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Saudades. To have saudades of anything is to yearn with
desire towards it. Saudades da Patria is home sickness. To say Tenho
Saudades without naming an object would be taken to mean I am all
yearning to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec204.txt')">call</a> a certain gentleman or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec204.txt')">lady</a> mine.]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: In Act I. sc. 3, of Congreve's Way of the World, Mirabell
says of Millamant,</p><p>I like her with all her faults, nay, like her for her faults. Her
follies are so natural, or so artful, that they become her; and those
affectations which in another woman would be odious, serve but to make
her more <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec204.txt')">agreeable</a>. Ill tell thee, Fainall, she once used me with
that insolence, that in revenge I took her to pieces, sifted her, and
separated her failings; I studied em and got em by rote. The
Catalogue was so large, that I was not without hopes one day or other
to hate her heartily: to which end I so used myself to think of em,
that at length, contrary to my design and expectation, they gave me
every hour less and less disturbance; till in a few days it became
habitual to me to remember em without being displeased. They are now
grown as familiar to me as my own frailties; and, in all probability,
in a little time longer I shall like em as well.]</p><p>

Paper was published.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
