<p>No. 205.             Thursday, October 25, 1711.            Addison.</p><p></p><p>Decipimur specie recti</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>When I meet with any vicious Character that is not generally known, in
order to prevent its doing Mischief, I draw it at length, and set it up
as a Scarecrow; by which means I do not only make an Example of the
Person to whom it belongs, but give Warning to all Her Majesty's
Subjects, that they may not suffer by it. Thus, to change the
[Allusion,[1]] I have marked out several of the Shoals and Quicksands of
Life, and am continually employed in discovering those [which [2]] are
still concealed, in order to keep the Ignorant and Unwary from running
upon them. It is with this Intention that I publish the following
Letter, which brings to light some Secrets of this Nature.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>There are none of your Speculations which I read over with greater
Delight, than those which are designed for the Improvement of our <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec205.txt')">Sex</a>.
You have endeavoured to correct our unreasonable Fears and
Superstitions, in your Seventh and Twelfth Papers; our Fancy for
Equipage, in your Fifteenth; our Love of Puppet-Shows, in your
Thirty-First; our Notions of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec205.txt')">Beauty</a>, in your Thirty-Third; our
Inclination for Romances, in your Thirty-Seventh; our Passion for
_French_ Fopperies, in your Forty-Fifth; our Manhood and <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec205.txt')">Party</a>-zeal,
in your Fifty-Seventh; our Abuse of Dancing, in your Sixty-Sixth and
Sixty-Seventh; our Levity, in your <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec205.txt')">Hundred</a> and Twenty-Eighth; our Love
of Coxcombs, in your Hundred and Fifty-Fourth, and Hundred and
Fifty-Seventh; our Tyranny over the Henpeckt, in your Hundred and
Seventy-Sixth. You have described the _Pict_ in your Forty-first; the
Idol, in your Seventy-Third; the Demurrer, in your Eighty-Ninth; the
Salamander, in your Hundred and Ninety-Eighth. You have likewise taken
to pieces our Dress, and represented to us the Extravagancies we are
often <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec205.txt')">guilty</a> of in that Particular. You have fallen upon our Patches,
in your Fiftieth and Eighty-First; our Commodes, in your
Ninety-Eighth; our Fans in your Hundred and Second; our Riding Habits
in your Hundred and Fourth; our Hoop-petticoats, in your Hundred and
Twenty-Seventh; besides a great many little Blemishes which you have
touched upon in your several other Papers, and in those many Letters
that are scattered up and down your Works. At the same Time we must
own, that the Compliments you pay our Sex are innumerable, and that
those very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec205.txt')">Faults</a> which you represent in us, are neither black in
themselves nor, as you own, universal among us. But, Sir, it is plain
that these your Discourses are calculated for none but the fashionable
Part of Womankind, and for the Use of those who are rather indiscreet
than vicious. But, Sir, there is a Sort of Prostitutes in the lower
Part of our Sex, who are a Scandal to us, and very well deserve to
fall under your Censure. I know it would debase your Paper too much to
enter into the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec205.txt')">Behaviour</a> of these <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec205.txt')">Female</a> Libertines; but as your
Remarks on some Part of it would be a doing of Justice to several
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec205.txt')">Women</a> of Virtue and Honour, whose Reputations suffer by it, I hope you
will not think it improper to give the Publick some Accounts of this
Nature. You must know, Sir, I am provoked to write you this Letter by
the Behaviour of an infamous <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec205.txt')">Woman</a>, who having passed her Youth in a
most shameless State of Prostitution, is now one of those who gain
their Livelihood by seducing others, that are younger than themselves,
and by establishing a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec205.txt')">criminal</a> Commerce between the two Sexes. Among
several of her Artifices to get <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec205.txt')">Money</a>, she frequently perswades a vain
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec205.txt')">young</a> Fellow, that such a Woman of Quality, or such a celebrated
Toast, entertains a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec205.txt')">secret</a> Passion for him, and wants nothing but an
Opportunity of revealing it: Nay, she has gone so far as to write
Letters in the Name of a Woman of Figure, to borrow Money of one of
these foolish _Roderigos_, [3] which she has afterwards appropriated
to her own Use. In the mean time, the Person who has lent the Money,
has thought a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec205.txt')">Lady</a> under Obligations to him, who scarce knew his Name;
and wondered at her Ingratitude when he has been with her, that she
has not owned the Favour, though at the same time he was too much a
Man of Honour to put her in mind of it.</p><p>When this abandoned Baggage meets with a Man who has Vanity enough to
give Credit to Relations of this nature, she turns him to very good
Account, by repeating Praises that were never uttered, and delivering
Messages that were never sent. As the House of this shameless Creature
is frequented by several Foreigners, I have heard of another Artifice,
out of which she often raises Money. The Foreigner sighs after some
_British_ Beauty, whom he only knows by Fame: Upon which she promises,
if he can be secret, to procure him a Meeting. The Stranger, ravished
at his good Fortune, gives her a Present, and in a little time is
introduced to some imaginary Title; for you must know that this
cunning Purveyor has her Representatives upon this Occasion, of some
of the finest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec205.txt')">Ladies</a> in the Kingdom. By this Means, as I am informed,
it is usual enough to meet with a German Count in foreign Countries,
that shall make his Boasts of Favours he has received from Women of
the highest Ranks, and the most unblemished Characters. Now, Sir, what
Safety is there for a Woman's Reputation, when a Lady may be thus
prostituted as it were by Proxy, and be reputed an unchaste Woman; as
the Hero in the ninth Book of _Dryden's_ Virgil is looked upon as a
Coward, because the Phantom which appeared in his Likeness ran away
from _Turnus?_ You may depend upon what I relate to you to be Matter
of Fact, and the Practice of more than one of these female Pandars. If
you print this Letter, I may give you some further Accounts of this
vicious Race of Women.
_Your humble Servant,_
BELVIDERA.</p><p>
I shall add two other Letters on different Subjects to fill up my Paper.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec205.txt')">Country</a> Clergyman, and hope you will lend me your Assistance
in ridiculing some little Indecencies which cannot so properly be
exposed from the Pulpit.</p><p>A Widow Lady, who straggled this Summer from _London_ into my Parish
for the Benefit of the Air, as she says, appears every _Sunday_ at
Church with many fashionable Extravagancies, to the great Astonishment
of my Congregation.</p><p>But what gives us the most Offence is her theatrical <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec205.txt')">Manner</a> of
Singing the Psalms. She introduces above fifty _Italian_ Airs into the
hundredth Psalm, and whilst we begin _All <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec205.txt')">People</a>_ in the old solemn
Tune of our Forefathers, she in a quite different Key runs Divisions
on the Vowels, and adorns them with the Graces of _Nicolini_; if she
meets with Eke or Aye, which are frequent in the Metre of _Hopkins_
and _Sternhold_,[4] we are certain to hear her quavering them half a
Minute after us to some sprightly Airs of the Opera.</p><p>I am very far from being an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec205.txt')">Enemy</a> to Church Musick; but fear this
Abuse of it may make my _Parish_ ridiculous, who already look on the
Singing Psalms as an Entertainment, and no Part of their Devotion:
Besides, I am apprehensive that the Infection may spread, for Squire
_Squeekum_, who by his Voice seems (if I may use the Expression) to be
cut out for an _Italian_ Singer, was last _Sunday_ practising the same
Airs.</p><p>I know the Lady's Principles, and that she will plead the Toleration,
which (as she fancies) allows her Non-Conformity in this Particular;
but I beg you to acquaint her, That Singing the Psalms in a different
Tune from the rest of the Congregation, is a Sort of Schism not
tolerated by that Act.</p><p>_I am, SIR, Your very humble Servant,_ R. S.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>In your Paper upon Temperance, you prescribe to us a Rule of
drinking, out of Sir _William Temple_, in the following <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec205.txt')">Words</a>; _The
first Glass for myself, the second for my Friends, the third for
Good-humour, and the fourth for mine Enemies_. Now, Sir, you must
know, that I have read this your _Spectator_, in a Club whereof I am a
Member; when our President told us, there was certainly an Error in
the Print, and that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec205.txt')">Word</a> _Glass_ should be _Bottle;_ and therefore
has ordered me to inform you of this Mistake, and to desire you to
publish the following _Errata:_ In the Paper of _Saturday, Octob._
13, Col. 3. Line 11, for _Glass_ read _Bottle_.</p><p>_Yours_, Robin Good-fellow.</p><p>

[Footnote 2: that]</p><p>
[Footnote 3: As the Roderigo whose money Iago used.]</p><p>
[Footnote 4: Thomas Sternhold who joined Hopkins, Norton, and others in
translation of the Psalms, was groom of the robes to Henry VIII. and
Edward VI.]</p><p>
