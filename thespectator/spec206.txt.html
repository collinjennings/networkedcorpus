<p>No. 206.             Friday, October 10, 1712.               Budgell.</p><p></p><p>'Candida perpetuo reside, concordia, lecto,
Tamque pari semper sit Venus æqua jugo.
Diligat illa, senem quondam: Sed et ipsa marito,
Tunc quoque cum fuerit, non videatur anus.'</p><p>Mart.</p><p></p><p>The following Essay is written by the Gentleman, to whom the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec206.txt')">World</a> is
oblig'd for those several excellent Discourses which have been marked
with the Letter X.</p><p>I have somewhere met with a Fable that made _Wealth_ the Father of
_<a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec206.txt')">Love</a>_. It is certain a Mind ought, at least, to be free from the
Apprehensions of Want and Poverty, before it can fully attend to all the
Softnesses and Endearments of this Passion. Notwithstanding we see
Multitudes of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec206.txt')">married</a> <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec206.txt')">People</a>, who are utter Strangers to this delightful
Passion amidst all the Affluence of the most plentiful Fortunes.</p><p>It is not sufficient to make a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec206.txt')">Marriage</a> happy, that the Humours of two
People should be alike; I could instance an hundred Pair, who have not
the least Sentiment of Love remaining for one another, yet are so like
in their Humours, that if they were not already married, the whole World
would design them for Man and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec206.txt')">Wife</a>.</p><p>The Spirit of Love has something so extremely fine in it, that it is
very often disturbed and lost, by some little Accidents which the
Careless and Unpolite never attend to, till it is gone past Recovery.</p><p>Nothing has more contributed to banish it from a married State, than too
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec206.txt')">great</a> a Familiarity, and laying aside the common Rules of Decency. Tho'
I could give Instances of this in several Particulars, I shall only
mention that of _<a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec206.txt')">Dress</a>_. The Beaus and Belles about Town, who dress
purely to catch one another, think there is no further occasion for the
Bait, when their first Design has succeeded. But besides the too common
Fault in point of Neatness, there are several others which I do not
remember to have seen touched upon, but in one of our modern Comedies,
[1] where a _French_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec206.txt')">Woman</a> offering to undress and dress herself before
the Lover of the Play, and assuring his Mistress that it was very useful
in _France_, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec206.txt')">Lady</a> tells her that's a Secret in Dress she never knew
before, and that she was so unpolish'd an _English_ Woman, as to resolve
never to learn even to dress before her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec206.txt')">Husband</a>.</p><p>There is something so gross in the Carriage of some Wives, that they
lose their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec206.txt')">Husbands</a> Hearts for Faults, which, if a Man has either
Good-Nature or Good-Breeding, he knows not how to tell them of. I am
afraid, indeed, the <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec206.txt')">Ladies</a> are generally most faulty in this Particular,
who, at their first giving into Love, find the Way so smooth and
pleasant, that they fancy 'tis scarce possible to be tired in it.</p><p>There is so much Nicety and Discretion requir'd to keep Love alive after
Marriage, and make <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec206.txt')">Conversation</a> still new and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec206.txt')">agreeable</a> after twenty or
thirty years, that I know nothing which seems readily to promise it, but
an earnest endeavour to please on both sides, and superior good Sense on
the part of Man.</p><p>By a Man of Sense, I mean one acquainted with Business and Letters.</p><p>A Woman very much settles her Esteem for a Man, according to the Figure
he makes in the World, and the Character he bears among his own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec206.txt')">Sex</a>. As
Learning is the chief Advantage we have over them, it is, methinks, as
scandalous and inexcusable for a Man of Fortune to be illiterate, as for
a Woman not to know how to behave her self on the most ordinary
Occasions. It is this which sets the two Sexes at the greatest Distance;
a Woman is vexed and surpriz'd, to find nothing more in the Conversation
of a Man, than in the common Tattle of her own Sex.</p><p>Some small Engagement at least in Business, not only sets a Man's
Talents in the fairest Light, and allots him a Part to act, in which a
Wife cannot well intermeddle; but gives frequent occasions for those
little Absences, which, whatever seeming Uneasiness they may give, are
some of the best Preservatives of Love and Desire.</p><p>The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec206.txt')">Fair</a> Sex are so conscious to themselves, that they have
nothing in them which can deserve entirely to engross the
whole Man, that they heartily despise one, who, to use their
own Expression, is always hanging at their Apron-Strings.</p><p>_Lætitia_ is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec206.txt')">pretty</a>, modest, tender, and has Sense enough; she married
_Erastus_, who is in a Post of some Business, and has a general Taste in
most Parts of polite Learning. _Lætitia_, where ever she visits, has the
pleasure to hear of something which was handsomely said or done by
_Erastus_. _Erastus_, since his Marriage, is more gay in his Dress than
ever, and in all Companies is as complaisant to _Lætitia_ as to any
other Lady. I have seen him give her her Fan, when it has dropped, with
all the Gallantry of a Lover. When they take the Air together, _Erastus_
is continually improving her Thoughts, and with a Turn of Wit and Spirit
which is peculiar to him, giving her an Insight into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec206.txt')">things</a> she had no
notion of before. _Lætitia_ is transported at having a new World thus
open'd to her, and hangs upon the Man that gives her such agreeable
Informations. _Erastus_ has carried this Point still further, as he
makes her daily not only more fond of him, but infinitely more satisfied
with herself. _Erastus_ finds a Justness or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec206.txt')">Beauty</a> in whatever she says
or observes, that _Lætitia_ herself was not aware of; and, by his
Assistance, she has discovered an hundred good Qualities and
Accomplishments in herself, which she never before once dreamed of.
_Erastus_, with the most artful Complaisance in the World, by several
remote Hints, finds the means to make her say or propose almost whatever
he has a mind to, which he always receives as her own Discovery, and
gives her all the Reputation of it.</p><p>_Erastus_ has a perfect Taste in Painting, and carried _Lætitia_ with
him the other day to see a Collection of Pictures. I sometimes visit
this happy Couple. As we were last Week walking in the long Gallery
before Dinner, _I have lately laid out some Mony in Paintings_, says
_Erastus; I bought that_ Venus _and_ Adonis _purely upon_ Lætitia's
_Judgment; it cost me three-score Guineas, and I was this morning
offer'd [a [2]] hundred for it_. I turned towards _Lætitia_, and saw her
Cheeks glow with Pleasure, while at the same time she cast a look upon
_Erastus_, the most tender and affectionate I ever beheld.</p><p>_Flavilla_ married _Tom Tawdry_; she was taken with his laced <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec206.txt')">Coat</a> and
rich Sword-knot; she has the mortification to see _Tom_ despised by all
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec206.txt')">worthy</a> Part of his own Sex. _Tom_ has nothing to do after Dinner,
but to determine whether he will pare his Nails at St. _James's,
White's_, or his own House. He has said nothing to _Flavilla_ since they
were married, which she might not have heard as well from her own Woman.
He however takes great care to keep up the saucy ill-natur'd Authority
of a Husband. Whatever _Flavilla_ happens to assert, _Tom_ immediately
contradicts with an Oath, by way of Preface, and, _My <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec206.txt')">Dear</a>, I must tell
you, you talk most confoundedly silly. Flavilla_ had a Heart naturally
as well dispos'd for all the Tenderness of Love as that of _Lætitia_;
but as Love seldom continues long after Esteem, it is difficult to
determine, at <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec206.txt')">present</a>, whether the unhappy _Flavilla_ hates or despises
the Person most, whom she is obliged to lead her whole Life with.</p><p>[X.]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Steele's _Funeral_, or _Grief a la Mode_, Act III.]</p><p>
