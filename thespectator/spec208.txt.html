<p>No. 208.               Monday, October 29, 1711.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>--Veniunt spectentur ut ips√¶.</p><p>Ov.[1]</p><p>
I have several Letters of <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec208.txt')">People</a> of good Sense, who lament the Depravity
or Poverty of Taste the Town is fallen into with relation to Plays and
publick Spectacles. A <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec208.txt')">Lady</a> in particular observes, that there is such a
Levity in the Minds of her own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec208.txt')">Sex</a>, that they seldom attend any thing
but Impertinences. It is indeed prodigious to observe how little Notice
is taken of the most exalted Parts of the best Tragedies in
_Shakespear_; nay, it is not only visible that Sensuality has devoured
all Greatness of Soul, but the Under-Passion (as I may so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec208.txt')">call</a> it) of a
noble Spirit, Pity, seems to be a Stranger to the Generality of an
<a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec208.txt')">Audience</a>. The Minds of Men are indeed very differently disposed; and the
Reliefs from Care and Attention are of one Sort in a <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec208.txt')">great</a> Spirit, and
of another in an ordinary one. The Man of a great <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec208.txt')">Heart</a> and a serious
Complexion, is more pleased with Instances of Generosity and Pity, than
the light and ludicrous Spirit can possibly be with the highest Strains
of Mirth and Laughter: It is therefore a melancholy Prospect when we see
a numerous Assembly lost to all serious Entertainments, and such
Incidents, as should move one sort of Concern, excite in them a quite
contrary one. In the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec208.txt')">Tragedy</a> of _Macbeth_, the other Night, [2] when the
Lady who is conscious of the Crime of murdering the King, seems utterly
astonished at the News, and makes an Exclamation at it, instead of the
Indignation which is natural to the Occasion, that Expression is
received with a loud Laugh: They were as merry when a Criminal was
stabbed. It is certainly an Occasion of rejoycing when the Wicked are
seized in their Designs; but I think it is not such a Triumph as is
exerted by Laughter.</p><p>You may generally observe, that the Appetites are sooner moved than the
Passions: A sly Expression which alludes to Bawdry, puts a whole Row
into a pleasing Smirk; when a good Sentence that describes an inward
Sentiment of the Soul, is received with the greatest Coldness and
Indifference. A Correspondent of mine, upon this Subject, has divided
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec208.txt')">Female</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec208.txt')">Part</a> of the Audience, and accounts for their Prepossession
against this reasonable Delight in the following <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec208.txt')">Manner</a>. The Prude, says
he, as she acts always in Contradiction, so she is gravely sullen at a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec208.txt')">Comedy</a>, and extravagantly gay at a Tragedy. The Coquette is so much
taken up with throwing her Eyes around the Audience, and considering the
Effect of them, that she cannot be expected to observe the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec208.txt')">Actors</a> but as
they are her Rivals, and take off the Observation of the Men from her
self. Besides these Species of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec208.txt')">Women</a>, there are the _Examples_, or the
first of the Mode: These are to be supposed too well acquainted with
what the Actor was going to say to be moved at it. After these one might
mention a certain flippant Set of Females who are Mimicks, and are
wonderfully diverted with the Conduct of all the People around them, and
are Spectators only of the Audience. But what is of all the most to be
lamented, is the Loss of a Party whom it would be worth preserving in
their right Senses upon all Occasions, and these are those whom we may
indifferently call the Innocent or the Unaffected. You may sometimes see
one of these sensibly touched with a well-wrought Incident; but then she
is immediately so impertinently observed by the Men, and frowned at by
some insensible Superior of her own Sex, that she is ashamed, and loses
the Enjoyment of the most laudable Concern, Pity. Thus the whole
Audience is afraid of letting fall a Tear, and shun as a Weakness the
best and worthiest Part of our Sense.</p><p>
[Sidenote: Pray settle what is to be a proper Notification of a
Persons being in Town, and how that differs according to Peoples
Quality.]</p><p>
_SIR,_</p><p>As you are one that doth not only pretend to reform, but effects it
amongst People of any Sense; makes me (who are one of the greatest of
your Admirers) give you this Trouble to desire you will settle the
Method of us Females knowing when one another is in Town: For they
have now got a Trick of never sending to their Acquaintance when they
first come; and if one does not visit them within the Week which they
stay at home, it is a mortal Quarrel. Now, dear Mr. SPEC, either
command them to put it in the Advertisement of your Paper, which is
generally read by our Sex, or else order them to breathe their saucy
Footmen (who are good for nothing else) by sending them to tell all
their Acquaintance. If you think to print this, pray put it into a
better Style as to the spelling Part. The Town is now filling every
Day, and it cannot be deferred, because People take Advantage of one
another by this Means and break off Acquaintance, and are rude:
Therefore pray put this in your Paper as soon as you can possibly, to
prevent any future Miscarriages of this Nature. I am, as I ever shall
be,</p><p>Dear SPEC,
_Your most obedient
Humble Servant,_
Mary Meanwell.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>October _the 20th_.</p><p>I have been out of Town, so did not meet with your Paper dated
_September_ the 28th, wherein you, to my Hearts Desire, expose that
cursed Vice of ensnaring poor <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec208.txt')">young</a> Girls, and drawing them from their
Friends. I assure you without Flattery it has saved a Prentice of mine
from Ruin; and in Token of Gratitude as well as for the Benefit of my
Family, I have put it in a Frame and Glass, and hung it behind my
Counter. I shall take Care to make my young ones read it every
Morning, to fortify them against such pernicious Rascals. I know not
whether what you writ was Matter of Fact, or your own Invention; but
this I will take my Oath on, the first Part is so exactly like what
happened to my Prentice, that had I read your Paper then, I should
have taken your Method to have secured a Villain. Go on and prosper.</p><p>_Your most obliged Humble Servant,_</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>Without Raillery, I desire you to insert this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec208.txt')">Word</a> for Word in your
next, as you value a Lovers Prayers. You see it is an Hue and Cry
after a stray Heart (with the Marks and Blemishes underwritten) which
whoever shall bring to you, shall receive Satisfaction. Let me beg of
you not to fail, as you remember the Passion you had for her to whom
you lately ended a Paper.</p><p>
Noble, Generous, Great, and Good,
But never to be understood;
Fickle as the Wind, still changing,
After every Female ranging,
Panting, trembling, sighing, dying,
But addicted much to Lying:
When the Siren Songs repeats,
Equal Measures still it beats;
Who-e'er shall wear it, it will smart her,
And who-e'er takes it, takes a Tartar.</p><p></p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Spectaret Populum ludis attentius ipsis.-Hor.]</p><p>
