<p>No. 209.             Tuesday, October 30, 1711.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>[Greek: Gynaikòs oudi chraem anaer laeízetai
Esthlaes ámeinon, oude rhígion kakaes.]</p><p>Simonides.</p><p></p><p>There are no <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec209.txt')">Authors</a> I am more pleased with than those who shew <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec209.txt')">human</a>
Nature in a Variety of Views, and describe the several Ages of the World
in their different Manners. A <a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec209.txt')">Reader</a> cannot be more rationally
entertained, than by comparing the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec209.txt')">Virtues</a> and Vices of his own Times
with those which prevailed in the Times of his Forefathers; and drawing
a Parallel in his Mind between his own private Character, and that of
other Persons, whether of his own Age, or of the Ages that went before
him. The Contemplation of Mankind under these changeable Colours, is apt
to shame us out of any particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec209.txt')">Vice</a>, or animate us to any particular
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec209.txt')">Virtue</a>, to make us pleased or displeased with our selves in the most
proper Points, to clear our Minds of Prejudice and Prepossession, and
rectify that Narrowness of Temper which inclines us to think amiss of
those who differ from our selves.</p><p>If we look into the Manners of the most remote Ages of the World, we
discover human Nature in her Simplicity; and the more we come downwards
towards our own Times, may observe her hiding herself in Artifices and
Refinements, Polished insensibly out of her Original Plainness, and at
length entirely lost under Form and Ceremony, and (what we <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec209.txt')">call</a>) good
Breeding. Read the Accounts of Men and <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec209.txt')">Women</a> as they are given us by the
most ancient <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec209.txt')">Writers</a>, both Sacred and Prophane, and you would think you
were reading the History of another Species.</p><p>Among the Writers of Antiquity, there are none who instruct us more
openly in the Manners of their respective Times in which they lived,
than those who have employed themselves in Satyr, under what Dress
soever it may appear; as there are no other Authors whose Province it is
to enter so directly into the Ways of Men, and set their Miscarriages in
so strong a Light.</p><p>_Simonides_,[1] a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec209.txt')">Poet</a> famous in his Generation, is, I think, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec209.txt')">Author</a> of
the oldest Satyr that is now extant; and, as some say, of the first that
was ever written. This Poet flourished about four hundred Years after
the Siege of _Troy;_ and shews, by his way of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec209.txt')">Writing</a>, the Simplicity,
or rather Coarseness, of the Age in which he lived. I have taken notice,
in my Hundred and sixty first Speculation, that the Rule of observing
what the _French_ call the _bienséance_, in an Allusion, has been found
out of later Years; and that the Ancients, provided there was a Likeness
in their Similitudes, did not much trouble themselves about the Decency
of the Comparison. The Satyr or Iambicks of _Simonides_, with which I
shall entertain my Readers in the present Paper, are a remarkable
Instance of what I formerly advanced. The Subject of this Satyr is
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec209.txt')">Woman</a>. He describes the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec209.txt')">Sex</a> in their several Characters, which he
derives to them from a fanciful Supposition raised upon the Doctrine of
Præexistence. He tells us, That the Gods formed the Souls of Women out
of those Seeds and Principles which compose several Kinds of Animals and
Elements; and that their Good or Bad Dispositions arise in them
according as such and such Seeds and Principles predominate in their
Constitutions. I have translated the Author very faithfully, and if not
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec209.txt')">Word</a> for Word (which our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec209.txt')">Language</a> would not bear) at least so as to
comprehend every one of his Sentiments, without adding any thing of my
own. I have already apologized for this Authors Want of Delicacy, and
must further premise, That the following Satyr affects only some of the
lower part of the Sex, and not those who have been refined by a Polite
Education, which was not so common in the Age of this Poet.</p><p>
_In the Beginning God made the Souls of Womankind out of different
Materials, and in a separate State from their Bodies_.</p><p>_The Souls of one <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec209.txt')">Kind</a> of Women were formed out of those Ingredients
which compose a Swine. A Woman of this Make is a Slut in her House and
a Glutton at her Table. She is uncleanly in her Person, a Slattern in
her Dress, and her Family is no better than a Dunghill_.</p><p>_A Second Sort of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec209.txt')">Female</a> Soul was formed out of the same Materials
that enter into the Composition of a Fox. Such an one is what we call
a notable discerning Woman, who has an Insight into every thing,
whether it be good or bad. In this Species of Females there are some
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec209.txt')">Virtuous</a> and some <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec209.txt')">Vicious</a>_.</p><p>_A Third Kind of Women were made up of Canine Particles. These are
what we commonly call_ Scolds, _who imitate the Animals of which they
were taken, that are always busy and barking, that snarl at every one
who comes in their Way, and live in perpetual Clamour_.</p><p>_The Fourth Kind of Women were made out of the Earth. These are your
Sluggards, who pass away their Time in Indolence and Ignorance, hover
over the Fire a whole Winter, and apply themselves with Alacrity to no
kind of Business but Eating_.</p><p>_The Fifth Species of Females were made out of the Sea. These are
Women of variable uneven Tempers, sometimes all Storm and Tempest,
sometimes all Calm and Sunshine. The Stranger who sees one of these in
her Smiles and Smoothness would cry her up for a Miracle of good
Humour; but on a sudden her Looks and her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec209.txt')">Words</a> are changed, she is
nothing but Fury and Outrage, Noise and Hurricane_.</p><p>_The Sixth Species were made up of the Ingredients which compose an
Ass, or a Beast of Burden. These are naturally exceeding slothful,
but, upon the Husbands exerting his Authority, will live upon hard
Fare, and do every thing to please him. They are however far from
being averse to Venereal Pleasure, and seldom refuse a Male
Companion_.</p><p>_The Cat furnished Materials for a Seventh Species of Women, who are
of a melancholy, froward, unamiable Nature, and so repugnant to the
Offers of Love, that they fly in the Face of their Husband when he
approaches them with conjugal Endearments. This Species of Women are
likewise subject to little Thefts, Cheats and Pilferings_.</p><p>_The Mare with a flowing Mane, which was never broke to any servile
Toil and Labour, composed an Eighth Species of Women. These are they
who have little Regard for their Husbands, who pass away their Time in
Dressing, Bathing, and Perfuming; who throw their Hair into the nicest
Curls, and trick it up with the fairest Flowers and Garlands. A Woman
of this Species is a very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec209.txt')">pretty</a> Thing for a Stranger to look upon,
but very detrimental to the Owner, unless it be a King or Prince who
takes a Fancy to such a Toy_.</p><p>_The Ninth Species of Females were taken out of the Ape. These are
such as are both ugly and ill-natured, who have nothing beautiful in
themselves, and endeavour to detract from or ridicule every thing
which appears so in others_.</p><p>_The Tenth and last Species of Women were made out of the Bee; and
happy is the Man who gets such an one for his Wife. She is altogether
faultless and unblameable; her Family flourishes and improves by her
good Management. She loves her Husband, and is beloved by him. She
brings him a Race of beautiful and virtuous Children. She
distinguishes her self among her Sex. She is surrounded with Graces.
She never sits among the loose Tribe of Women, nor passes away her
Time with them in wanton Discourses. She is full of Virtue and
Prudence, and is the best Wife that_ Jupiter _can bestow on Man_.</p><p>
I shall conclude these Iambicks with the Motto of this Paper, which is a
Fragment of the same Author: _A Man cannot possess any Thing that is
better than a good Woman, nor any thing that is worse than a bad one_.</p><p>As the Poet has shewn a great Penetration in this Diversity of Female
Characters, he has avoided the Fault which _Juvenal_ and Monsieur
_Boileau_ are guilty of, the former in his sixth, and the other in his
last Satyr, where they have endeavoured to expose the Sex in general,
without doing Justice to the valuable Part of it. Such levelling Satyrs
are of no Use to the World, and for this Reason I have often wondered
how the _French_ Author above-mentioned, who was a Man of exquisite
Judgment, and a Lover of Virtue, could think human Nature a proper
Subject for Satyr in another of his celebrated Pieces, which is called
_The Satyr upon Man_. What Vice or Frailty can a Discourse correct,
which censures the whole Species alike, and endeavours to shew by some
Superficial Strokes of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec209.txt')">Wit</a>, that Brutes are the more excellent Creatures
of the two? A Satyr should expose nothing but what is corrigible, and
make a due Discrimination between those who are, and those who are not
the proper Objects of it.</p><p>L.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Of the poems of Simonides, contemporary of AEschylus, only
fragments remain. He died about 467 B.C.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
