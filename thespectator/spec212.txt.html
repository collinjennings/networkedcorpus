<p>No. 212.                Friday, November 2, 1711.             Steele.</p><p></p><p>--Eripe turpi
Colla jugo, liber, liber dic, sum age--</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I Never look upon my <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec212.txt')">dear</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec212.txt')">Wife</a>, but I think of the Happiness Sir
ROGER DE COVERLEY enjoys, in having such a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec212.txt')">Friend</a> as you to expose in
proper Colours the Cruelty and Perverseness of his Mistress. I have
very often wished you visited in our Family, and were acquainted with
my Spouse; she would afford you for some Months at least Matter enough
for one _Spectator_ a Week. Since we are not so happy as to be of your
Acquaintance, give me leave to represent to you our present
Circumstances as well as I can in Writing. You are to know then that I
am not of a very different Constitution from _Nathaniel Henroost_,
whom you have lately recorded in your Speculations; and have a Wife
who makes a more tyrannical Use of the Knowledge of my easy Temper
than that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec212.txt')">Lady</a> ever pretended to. We had not been a Month <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec212.txt')">married</a>,
when she found in me a certain Pain to give Offence, and an Indolence
that made me bear little Inconveniences rather than dispute about
them. From this Observation it soon came to that pass, that if I
offered to go abroad, she would get between me and the Door, kiss me,
and say she could not part with me; and then down again I sat. In a
Day or two after this first pleasant Step towards confining me, she
declared to me, that I was all the World to her, and she thought she
ought to be all the World to me. If, she said, my Dear loves me as
much as I <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec212.txt')">love</a> him, he will never be tired of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec212.txt')">Company</a>. This
Declaration was followed by my being denied to all my Acquaintance;
and it very soon came to that pass, that to give an Answer at the Door
before my Face, the Servants would ask her whether I was within or
not; and she would answer No with great Fondness, and tell me I was a
good Dear. I will not enumerate more little Circumstances to give you
a livelier Sense of my Condition; but tell you in general, that from
such Steps as these at first, I now live the Life of a Prisoner of
State; my Letters are opened, and I have not the Use of Pen, Ink and
Paper, but in her Presence. I never go abroad, except she sometimes
takes me with her in her Coach to take the Air, if it may be called
so, when we drive, as we generally do, with the Glasses up. I have
overheard my Servants lament my Condition, but they dare not bring me
Messages without her Knowledge, because they doubt my Resolution to
stand by em. In the midst of this insipid Way of Life, an old
Acquaintance of mine, _Tom Meggot_, who is a Favourite with her, and
allowed to visit me in her Company because he sings prettily, has
roused me to rebel, and conveyed his Intelligence to me in the
following <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec212.txt')">Manner</a>. My Wife is a great Pretender to <a name="topic47" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec212.txt')">Musick</a>, and very
ignorant of it; but far gone in the _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec212.txt')">Italian</a>_ Taste. _Tom_ goes to
_Armstrong_, the famous fine Writer of Musick, and desires him to put
this Sentence of _Tully_ [1] in the Scale of an _Italian_ Air, and
write it out for my Spouse from him. _An ille mihi liber cui mulier
imperat? Cui leges imponit, praescribit, jubet, vetat <a name="topic15" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec212.txt')">quod</a> videtur?
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec212.txt')">Qui</a> nihil imperanti negare, nihil recusare audet? Poscit? dandum <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec212.txt')">est</a>.
Vocat? veniendum. Ejicit? abeundum. Minitatur? extimiscendum. Does he
live like a Gentleman who is commanded by a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec212.txt')">Woman</a>? He to whom she
gives Law, grants and denies what she pleases? who can neither deny
her any thing she asks, or refuse to do any thing she commands_?</p><p>To be short, my Wife was extremely pleased with it; said the
_Italian_ was the only Language for Musick; and admired how
wonderfully tender the Sentiment was, and how pretty the Accent is of
that Language, with the rest that is said by Rote on that Occasion.
Mr. _Meggot_ is sent for to sing this Air, which he performs with
mighty Applause; and my Wife is in Ecstasy on the Occasion, and glad
to find, by my being so much pleased, that I was at last come into the
Notion of the _Italian_; for, said she, it grows upon one when one
once comes to know a little of the Language; and pray, Mr. _Meggot_,
sing again those Notes, _Nihil Imperanti negare, nihil recusare_. You
may believe I was not a little delighted with my Friend _Toms_
Expedient to alarm me, and in Obedience to his Summons I give all this
Story thus at large; and I am resolved, when this appears in the
_Spectator_, to declare for my self. The manner of the Insurrection I
contrive by your Means, which shall be no other than that _Tom
Meggot_, who is at our Tea-table every Morning, shall read it to us;
and if my Dear can take the Hint, and say not one <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec212.txt')">Word</a>, but let this
be the Beginning of a new Life without farther Explanation, it is very
well; for as soon as the _Spectator_ is read out, I shall, without
more ado, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec212.txt')">call</a> for the Coach, name the Hour when I shall be at home,
if I come at all; if I do not, they may go to Dinner. If my Spouse
only swells and says nothing, _Tom_ and I go out together, and all is
well, as I said before; but if she begins to command or expostulate,
you shall in my next to you receive a full Account of her Resistance
and Submission, for submit the dear thing must to,</p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>_Your most obedient humble Servant_,</p><p>Anthony Freeman.</p><p>_P. S._ I hope I need not tell you that I desire this may be in your
very next.</p><p>
