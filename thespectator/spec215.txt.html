<p>No. 215.              Tuesday, November 6, 1711.                Addison.</p><p></p><p>--Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes
Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros.</p><p>Ov.</p><p></p><p>I consider an <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec215.txt')">Human</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec215.txt')">Soul</a> without Education like Marble in the Quarry,
which shews none of its inherent Beauties, till the Skill of the
Polisher fetches out the Colours, makes the Surface shine, and discovers
every ornamental Cloud, Spot, and Vein that runs through the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec215.txt')">Body</a> of it.
Education, after the same manner, when it <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec215.txt')">works</a> upon a noble <a name="topic21" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec215.txt')">Mind</a>, draws
out to View every latent <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec215.txt')">Virtue</a> and Perfection, which without such Helps
are never able to make their Appearance.</p><p>If my Reader will give me leave to change the Allusion so soon upon him,
I shall make use of the same Instance to illustrate the Force of
Education, which _Aristotle_ has brought to explain his Doctrine of
Substantial Forms, when he tells us that a Statue lies hid in a Block of
Marble; and that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec215.txt')">Art</a> of the statuary only clears away the
superfluous Matter, and removes the Rubbish. The Figure is in the Stone,
the Sculptor only finds it. What Sculpture is to a Block of Marble,
Education is to a Human Soul. The Philosopher, the Saint, or the Hero,
the Wise, the Good, or the Great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec215.txt')">Man</a>, very often lie hid and concealed
in a Plebeian, which a proper Education might have disinterred, and have
brought to Light. I am therefore much delighted with Reading the
Accounts of Savage Nations, and with contemplating those <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec215.txt')">Virtues</a> which
are wild and uncultivated; to see Courage exerting it self in
Fierceness, Resolution in Obstinacy, Wisdom in Cunning, Patience in
Sullenness and Despair.</p><p>Mens <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec215.txt')">Passions</a> operate variously, and appear in different kinds of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec215.txt')">Actions</a>, according as they are more or less rectified and swayed by
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec215.txt')">Reason</a>. When one hears of Negroes, who upon the <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec215.txt')">Death</a> of their Masters,
or upon changing their Service, hang themselves upon the next Tree, as
it frequently happens in our _American_ Plantations, who can forbear
admiring their Fidelity, though it expresses it self in so dreadful a
manner? What might not that Savage Greatness of Soul which appears in
these poor Wretches on many Occasions, be raised to, were it rightly
cultivated? And what Colour of Excuse can there be for the Contempt with
which we treat this Part of our Species; That we should not put them
upon the common foot of Humanity, that we should only set an
insignificant Fine upon the Man who murders them; nay, that we should,
as much as in us lies, cut them off from the Prospects of Happiness in
another <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec215.txt')">World</a> as well as in this, and deny them that which we look upon
as the proper Means for attaining it?</p><p>Since I am engaged on this Subject, I cannot forbear mentioning a Story
which I have lately heard, and which is so well attested, that I have no
manner of Reason to suspect the Truth of it. I may call it a kind of
wild Tragedy that passed about twelve Years ago at St. _Christopher's_,
one of our _British_ Leeward Islands. The Negroes who were the persons
concerned in it, were all of them the Slaves of a Gentleman who is now
in _England_.</p><p>This Gentleman among his Negroes had a young Woman, who was look'd upon
as a most extraordinary Beauty by those of her own Complexion. He had at
the same time two young Fellows who were likewise Negroes and Slaves,
remarkable for the Comeliness of their Persons, and for the Friendship
which they bore to one another. It unfortunately happened that both of
them fell in love with the Female Negro above mentioned, who would have
been very glad to have taken either of them for her Husband, provided
they could agree between themselves which should be the Man. But they
were both so passionately in Love with her, that neither of them could
think of giving her up to his Rival; and at the same time were so true
to one another, that neither of them would think of gaining her without
his Friends Consent. The Torments of these two Lovers were the
Discourse of the Family to which they belonged, who could not forbear
observing the strange Complication of Passions which perplexed the
Hearts of the poor Negroes, that often dropped Expressions of the
Uneasiness they underwent, and how impossible it was for either of them
ever to be happy.</p><p>After a long Struggle between Love and Friendship, Truth and Jealousy,
they one Day took a Walk together into a Wood, carrying their Mistress
along with them: Where, after abundance of Lamentations, they stabbed
her to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec215.txt')">Heart</a>, of which she immediately died. A Slave who was at his
Work not far from the Place where this astonishing Piece of Cruelty was
committed, hearing the Shrieks of the dying Person, ran to see what was
the Occasion of them. He there discovered the Woman lying dead upon the
Ground, with the two Negroes on each side of her, kissing the dead
Corps, weeping over it, and beating their Breasts in the utmost Agonies
of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec215.txt')">Grief</a> and Despair. He immediately ran to the _English_ Family with
the News of what he had seen; who upon coming to the Place saw the Woman
dead, and the two Negroes expiring by her with Wounds they had given
themselves.</p><p>We see in this amazing Instance of Barbarity, what strange Disorders are
bred in the minds of those Men whose Passions are not regulated by
Virtue, and disciplined by Reason. Though the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec215.txt')">Action</a> which I have
recited is in it self full of Guilt and Horror, it proceeded from a
Temper of Mind which might have produced very noble Fruits, had it been
informed and guided by a suitable Education.</p><p>It is therefore an unspeakable Blessing to be born in those Parts of the
World where Wisdom and Knowledge flourish; tho it must be confest,
there are, even in these Parts, several poor uninstructed Persons, who
are but little above the Inhabitants of those Nations of which I have
been here speaking; as those who have had the Advantages of a more
liberal Education, rise above one another by several different Degrees
of Perfection. For to return to our Statue in the Block of Marble, we
see it sometimes only begun to be chipped, sometimes rough-hewn and but
just sketched into an human Figure; sometimes we see the Man appearing
distinctly in all his Limbs and Features, sometimes we find the Figure
wrought up to a great Elegancy, but seldom meet with any to which the
Hand of a _Phidias_ or _Praxiteles_ could not give several nice Touches
and Finishings.</p><p>Discourses of Morality, and Reflections upon human <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec215.txt')">Nature</a>, are the best
Means we can make use of to improve our Minds, and gain a true Knowledge
of our selves, and consequently to recover our Souls out of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec215.txt')">Vice</a>,
Ignorance, and Prejudice, which naturally cleave to them. I have all
along profest myself in this Paper a Promoter of these great Ends; and I
flatter my self that I do from Day to Day contribute something to the
polishing of Mens Minds: at least my Design is laudable, whatever the
Execution may be. I must confess I am not a little encouraged in it by
many Letters, which I receive from unknown Hands, in Approbation of my
Endeavours; and must take this Opportunity of returning my Thanks to
those who write them, and excusing my self for not inserting several of
them in my Papers, which I am sensible would be a very great Ornament to
them. Should I publish the Praises which are so well penned, they would
do Honour to the Persons who write them; but my publishing of them would
I <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec215.txt')">fear</a> be a sufficient Instance to the World that I did not deserve them.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p>
