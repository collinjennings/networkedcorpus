<p>No. 217.              Thursday, Nov. 8, 1711.                 Budgell.</p><p></p><p>--Tunc foemina simplex,
Et pariter toto repetitur clamor ab antro.</p><p>Juv. Sat. 6.</p><p></p><p>I shall entertain my Reader to-day with some Letters from my
Correspondents. The first of them is the Description of a <a name="topic46" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec217.txt')">Club</a>, whether
real or imaginary I cannot determine; but am apt to fancy, that the
Writer of it, whoever she is, has formed a kind of Nocturnal Orgie out
of her own Fancy: Whether this be so or not, her Letter may conduce to
the Amendment of that kind of Persons who are represented in it, and
whose Characters are frequent enough in the World.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>In some of your first Papers you were pleased to give the Publick a
very diverting Account of several <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec217.txt')">Clubs</a> and nocturnal Assemblies; but
I am a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec217.txt')">Member</a> of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec217.txt')">Society</a> which has wholly escaped your Notice, I
mean a Club of She-Romps. We take each a Hackney-Coach, and meet once
a Week in a large upper Chamber, which we hire by the Year for that
Purpose; our Landlord and his Family, who are quiet <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec217.txt')">People</a>, constantly
contriving to be abroad on our Club-Night. We are no sooner come
together than we throw off all that Modesty and Reservedness with
which our <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec217.txt')">Sex</a> are obliged to disguise themselves in publick Places. I
am not able to express the Pleasure we enjoy from Ten at Night till
four in the Morning, in being as rude as you Men can be, for your
Lives. As our Play runs high the Room is immediately filled with
broken Fans, torn Petticoats, Lappets of Head-dresses, Flounces,
Furbelows, Garters, and Working-Aprons. I had forgot to tell you at
first, that besides the Coaches we come in our selves, there is one
which stands always empty to carry off our _dead Men_, for so we <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec217.txt')">call</a>
all those Fragments and Tatters with which the Room is strewed, and
which we pack up together in Bundles and put into the aforesaid Coach.
It is no small Diversion for us to meet the next Night at some
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec217.txt')">Members</a> Chamber, where every one is to pick out what belonged to her
from this confused Bundle of Silks, Stuffs, Laces, and Ribbons. I have
hitherto given you an Account of our Diversion on ordinary
Club-Nights; but must acquaint you farther, that once a Month we
_demolish a Prude_, that is, we get some queer formal Creature in
among us, and unrig her in an Instant. Our last Months Prude was so
armed and fortified in Whalebone and Buckram that we had much ado to
come at her; but you would have died with laughing to have seen how
the sober awkward Thing looked when she was forced out of her
Intrenchments. In short, Sir, 'tis impossible to give you a true Notion
of our Sports, unless you would come one Night amongst us; and tho it
be directly against the Rules of our Society to admit a Male Visitant,
we repose so much Confidence in your Silence and Taciturnity,
that was agreed by the whole Club, at our last Meeting, to give you
Entrance for one Night as a Spectator.</p><p>_I am, Your Humble Servant,_</p><p>Kitty Termagant.</p><p>P. S. _We shall demolish a Prude next Thursday._</p><p>Tho I thank _Kitty_ for her kind Offer, I do not at present find in my
self any Inclination, to venture my Person with her and her romping
Companions. I should regard my self as a second _Clodius_ intruding on
the Mysterious Rites of the _Bona Dea_, and should apprehend being
_Demolished_ as much as the _Prude_.</p><p>The following Letter comes from a Gentleman, whose Taste I find is much
too delicate to endure the least Advance towards Romping. I may perhaps
hereafter improve upon the Hint he has given me, and make it the Subject
of a whole _Spectator;_ in the mean time take it as it follows in his
own Words.</p><p>
_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>It is my Misfortune to be in Love with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec217.txt')">young</a> Creature who is daily
committing Faults, which though they give me the utmost Uneasiness, I
know not how to reprove her for, or even acquaint her with. She is
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec217.txt')">pretty</a>, dresses well, is rich, and good-humour'd; but either wholly
neglects, or has no Notion of that which Polite People have agreed to
distinguish by the Name of _Delicacy_. After our Return from a Walk
the other Day she threw her self into an Elbow-Chair, and professed
before a large <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec217.txt')">Company</a>, that _she was all over in a Sweat_. She told
me this Afternoon that her _Stomach aked;_ and was complaining
Yesterday at Dinner of something that _stuck in her Teeth_. I treated
her with a Basket of Fruit last Summer, which she eat so very
greedily, as almost made me resolve never to see her more. In short,
Sir, I begin to tremble whenever I see her about to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec217.txt')">speak</a> or move. As
she does not want Sense, if she takes these Hints I am happy; if not,
I am more than afraid, that these Things which shock me even in the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec217.txt')">Behaviour</a> of a Mistress, will appear insupportable in that of a Wife.</p><p>_I am, SIR, Yours, &c_.</p><p>
My next Letter comes from a Correspondent whom I cannot but very much
value, upon the Account which she gives of her self.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am happily arrived at a State of Tranquillity, which few People
envy, I mean that of an old Maid; therefore being wholly unconcerned
in all that Medley of Follies which our Sex is apt to contract from
their silly Fondness of yours, I read your Railleries on us without
Provocation. I can say with _Hamlet,_</p><p>--Man delights not me,
Nor <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec217.txt')">Woman</a> neither--</p><p>Therefore, dear Sir, as you never spare your own Sex, do not be afraid
of reproving what is ridiculous in ours, and you will oblige at least
one Woman, who is</p><p>_Your humble Servant_, Susannah Frost.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am Wife to a Clergyman, and cannot help thinking that in your Tenth
or Tithe-Character of Womankind [1] you meant my self, therefore I
have no Quarrel against you for the other Nine Characters.</p><p>_Your humble Servant,_ A.B.</p><p>
X.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: See No. 209.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
