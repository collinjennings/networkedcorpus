<p>No. 218.                 Friday, November 9, 1711.            Steele.</p><p></p><p>Quid de quoque viro et cui dicas s√¶pe caveto.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I happened the other Day, as my Way is, to strole into a little
Coffee-house beyond Aldgate; and as I sat there, two or three very plain
sensible Men were talking of the SPECTATOR. One said, he had that
Morning drawn the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec218.txt')">great</a> Benefit Ticket; another wished he had; but a
third shaked his Head and said, It was pity that the Writer of that
Paper was such a sort of Man, that it was no great Matter whether he had
it or no. He is, it seems, said the good Man, the most extravagant
Creature in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec218.txt')">World</a>; has run through vast Sums, and yet been in
continual Want; a Man, for all he talks so well of Oeconomy, unfit for
any of the Offices of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec218.txt')">Life</a>, by reason of his Profuseness. It would be an
unhappy thing to be his Wife, his Child, or his <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec218.txt')">Friend</a>; and yet he talks
as well of those Duties of Life as any one. Much Reflection has brought
me to so easy a Contempt for every thing which is false, that this heavy
Accusation gave me no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec218.txt')">manner</a> of Uneasiness; but at the same Time it
threw me into deep Thought upon the Subject of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec218.txt')">Fame</a> in general; and I
could not but pity such as were so weak, as to value what the common
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec218.txt')">People</a> say out of their own talkative Temper to the Advantage or
Diminution of those whom they mention, without being moved either by
Malice or Good-will. It will be too long to expatiate upon the Sense all
Mankind have of Fame, and the inexpressible Pleasure which there is in
the Approbation of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec218.txt')">worthy</a> Men, to all who are capable of worthy Actions;
but methinks one may divide the general <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec218.txt')">Word</a> Fame into three different
Species, as it regards the different Orders of Mankind who have any
Thing to do with it. Fame therefore may be divided into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec218.txt')">Glory</a>, which
respects the Hero; Reputation, which is preserved by every Gentleman;
and Credit, which must be supported by every Tradesman. These
Possessions in Fame are dearer than Life to these Characters of Men, or
rather are the Life of those Characters. Glory, while the Hero pursues
great and noble Enterprizes, is impregnable; and all the Assailants of
his Renown do but shew their Pain and Impatience of its Brightness,
without throwing the least Shade upon it. If the Foundation of an high
Name be Virtue and Service, all that is offered against it is but
Rumour, which is too short-liv'd to stand up in Competition with Glory,
which is everlasting.</p><p>Reputation, which is the Portion of every Man who would live with the
elegant and knowing Part of Mankind, is as stable as Glory, if it be as
well founded; and the common Cause of human Society is thought concerned
when we hear a Man of good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec218.txt')">Behaviour</a> calumniated: Besides which,
according to a prevailing Custom amongst us, every Man has his Defence
in his own Arm; and Reproach is soon checked, put out of Countenance,
and overtaken by Disgrace.</p><p>The most unhappy of all Men, and the most exposed to the Malignity or
Wantonness of the common Voice, is the Trader. Credit is undone in
Whispers. The Tradesman's Wound is received from one who is more private
and more cruel than the Ruffian with the Lanthorn and Dagger. The Manner
of repeating a Man's Name, As; _Mr_. Cash, _Oh! do you leave your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec218.txt')">Money</a>
at his Shop? Why, do you know Mr_. Searoom? _He is indeed a general
<a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec218.txt')">Merchant</a>_. I say, I have seen, from the Iteration of a Man's Name,
hiding one Thought of him, and explaining what you hide by saying
something to his Advantage when you <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec218.txt')">speak</a>, a Merchant hurt in his
Credit; and him who, every Day he lived, literally added to the Value of
his Native <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec218.txt')">Country</a>, undone by one who was only a Burthen and a Blemish
to it. Since every Body who knows the World is sensible of this great
Evil, how careful ought a Man to be in his Language of a Merchant? It
may possibly be in the Power of a very shallow Creature to lay the Ruin
of the best Family in the most opulent City; and the more so, the more
highly he deserves of his Country; that is to say, the farther he places
his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec218.txt')">Wealth</a> out of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec218.txt')">Hands</a>, to draw home that of another Climate.</p><p>In this Case an ill Word may change Plenty into Want, and by a rash
Sentence a free and generous <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec218.txt')">Fortune</a> may in a few Days be reduced to
Beggary. How little does a giddy Prater imagine, that an idle Phrase to
the Disfavour of a Merchant may be as pernicious in the Consequence, as
the Forgery of a Deed to bar an Inheritance would be to a Gentleman?
Land stands where it did before a Gentleman was calumniated, and the
State of a great Action is just as it was before Calumny was offered to
diminish it, and there is Time, Place and Occasion expected to unravel
all that is contrived against those Characters; but the Trader who is
ready only for probable Demands upon him, can have no Armour against the
Inquisitive, the Malicious, and the Envious, who are prepared to fill
the Cry to his Dishonour. Fire and Sword are slow Engines of
Destruction, in Comparison of the Babbler in the Case of the Merchant.</p><p>For this Reason I thought it an imitable Piece of Humanity of a
Gentleman of my Acquaintance, who had great Variety of Affairs, and used
to talk with Warmth enough against Gentlemen by whom he thought himself
ill dealt with; but he would never let any thing be urged against a
Merchant (with whom he had any Difference) except in a Court of Justice.
He used to say, that to speak ill of a Merchant, was to begin his Suit
with Judgment and Execution. One cannot, I think, say more on this
Occasion, than to repeat, That the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec218.txt')">Merit</a> of the Merchant is above that
of all other Subjects; for while he is untouched in his Credit, his
Hand-writing is a more portable Coin for the Service of his
Fellow-Citizens, and his Word the Gold of Ophir to the Country wherein
he resides.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
