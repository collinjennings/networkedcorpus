<p>No. 22.                Monday, March 26, 1711.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
The <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec22.txt')">word</a> _Spectator_ being most usually understood as one of the
<a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec22.txt')">Audience</a> at Publick Representations in our Theatres, I seldom fail of
many Letters relating to Plays and Operas. But, indeed, there are such
monstrous things done in both, that if one had not been an Eye-witness
of them, one could not believe that such Matters had really been
exhibited. There is very little which concerns human Life, or is a
Picture of Nature, that is regarded by the greater <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec22.txt')">Part</a> of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec22.txt')">Company</a>.
The Understanding is dismissed from our Entertainments. Our Mirth is the
Laughter of Fools, and our Admiration the Wonder of Idiots; else such
improbable, monstrous, and incoherent Dreams could not go off as they
do, not only without the utmost Scorn and Contempt, but even with the
loudest Applause and Approbation. But the Letters of my Correspondents
will represent this Affair in a more lively <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec22.txt')">Manner</a> than any Discourse of
my own; I [shall therefore [1] ] give them to my Reader with only this
Preparation, that they all come from Players, [and that the business of
Playing is now so managed that you are not to be surprised when I say]
one or two of [them [2]] are rational, others sensitive and vegetative
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec22.txt')">Actors</a>, and others wholly inanimate. I shall not place these as I have
named them, but as they have Precedence in the Opinion of their
Audiences.</p><p>
"Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>Your having been so humble as to take Notice of the Epistles of other
Animals, emboldens me, who am the wild Boar that was killed by Mrs.
_Tofts_, [3] to represent to you, That I think I was hardly used
in not having the Part of the <a name="topic47" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec22.txt')">Lion</a> in 'Hydaspes' given to me. It
would have been but a natural Step for me to have personated that
noble Creature, after having behaved my self to Satisfaction in the
Part above-mention'd: But that of a Lion, is too great a Character for
one that never trod the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec22.txt')">Stage</a> before but upon two Legs. As for the
little Resistance which I made, I hope it may be excused, when it is
considered that the Dart was thrown at me by so fair an Hand. I must
confess I had but just put on my Brutality; and _Camilla's_
charms were such, that b-holding her erect Mien, hearing her charming
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec22.txt')">Voice</a>, and astonished with her graceful Motion, I could not keep up to
my assumed Fierceness, but died like a Man.</p><p>I am Sir,</p><p>Your most humble Servan.,</p><p>Thomas Prone."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>This is to let you understand, that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec22.txt')">Play</a>-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec22.txt')">House</a> is a Representation
of the World in nothing so much as in this Particular, That no one
rises in it according to his Merit. I have acted several Parts of
Household-stuff with great Applause for many Years: I am one of the
Men in the Hangings in the _Emperour of the Moon_; [4] I have
twice performed the third Chair in an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec22.txt')">English</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec22.txt')">Opera</a>; and have
rehearsed the Pump in the _Fortune-Hunters_. [5] I am now grown
old, and hope you will recommend me so effectually, as that I may say
something before I go off the Stage: In which you will do a great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec22.txt')">Act</a>
of Charity to</p><p>Your most humble servant,</p><p>William Serene."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>Understanding that Mr. _Serene_ has writ to you, and desired to
be raised from dumb and still Parts; I desire, if you give him Motion
or Speech, that you would advance me in my Way, and let me keep on in
what I humbly presume I am a Master, to wit, in representing human and
still Life together. I have several times acted one of the finest
Flower-pots in the same Opera wherein Mr. _Serene_ is a Chair;
therefore, upon his promotion, request that I may succeed him in the
Hangings, with my Hand in the Orange-Trees.</p><p>Your humble servant,</p><p>Ralph Simple."</p><p></p><p>"Drury Lane, March 24, 1710-11.</p><p>SIR,</p><p>I saw your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec22.txt')">Friend</a> the Templar this Evening in the Pit, and thought he
looked very little pleased with the Representation of the mad Scene of
the _Pilgrim_. I wish, Sir, you would do us the Favour to animadvert
frequently upon the false Taste the Town is in, with Relation to Plays
as well as Operas. It certainly requires a Degree of Understanding to
play justly; but such is our Condition, that we are to suspend our
Reason to perform our Parts. As to Scenes of Madness, you know, Sir,
there are noble Instances of this Kind in _Shakespear_; but then it is
the Disturbance of a noble Mind, from generous and humane Resentments:
It is like that Grief which we have for the decease of our Friends: It
is no Diminution, but a Recommendation of humane Nature, that in such
Incidents Passion gets the better of Reason; and all we can think to
comfort ourselves, is impotent against half what we feel. I will not
mention that we had an Idiot in the Scene, and all the Sense it is
represented to have, is that of Lust. As for my self, who have long
taken Pains in personating the Passions, I have to Night acted only an
Appetite: The part I play'd is Thirst, but it is represented as
written rather by a Drayman than a Poet. I come in with a Tub about
me, that Tub hung with Quart-pots; with a full Gallon at my Mouth. [6]
I am ashamed to tell you that I pleased very much, and this was
introduced as a Madness; but sure it was not humane Madness, for a
Mule or an [ass [7]] may have been as dry as ever I was in my Life.</p><p>I am, Sir,</p><p>Your most obedient And humble servant."</p><p></p><p>"From the Savoy in the Strand.</p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>If you can read it with dry Eyes, I give you this trouble to acquaint
you, that I am the unfortunate King _Latinus_, and believe I am the
first Prince that dated from this Palace since _John_ of _Gaunt_. Such
is the Uncertainty of all human Greatness, that I who lately never
moved without a Guard, am now pressed as a common Soldier, and am to
sail with the first fair Wind against my Brother _Lewis_ of _France_.
It is a very hard thing to put off a Character which one has appeared
in with Applause: This I experienced since the Loss of my Diadem; for,
upon quarrelling with another Recruit, I spoke my Indignation out of
my Part in _recitativo:_</p><p>... Most audacious Slave,
Dar'st thou an angry Monarch's Fury brave? [8]</p><p>The Words were no sooner out of my Mouth, when a Serjeant knock'd me
down, and ask'd me if I had a Mind to Mutiny, in talking things no
Body understood. You see, Sir, my unhappy Circumstances; and if by
your Mediation you can procure a Subsidy for a Prince (who never
failed to make all that beheld him merry at his Appearance) you will
merit the Thanks of</p><p>Your friend,</p><p>The King of _Latium_."</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: therefore shall]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: whom]</p><p>
[Footnote 3:  In the opera of 'Camilla':</p><p>Camilla:    That Dorindas my Name.</p><p>Linco:      Well, I knowt, Ill take care.</p><p>Camilla:    And my Life scarce of late--</p><p>Linco:      You need not repeat.</p><p>Prenesto:   Help me! oh help me!</p><p>[A wild Boar struck by Prenesto.]</p><p>Huntsman:   Lets try to assist him.</p><p>Linco:      Ye Gods, what Alarm!</p><p>Huntsman:   Quick run to his aid.</p><p>[Enter Prenesto: The Boar pursuing him.]</p><p>Prenesto:   O Heavns! who defends me?</p><p>Camilla:    My Arm.</p><p>[She throws a Dart, and kills the Boar.]</p><p>Linco:      Dorinda of nothing afraid,
Shes sprightly and gay, a valiant Maid,
And as bright as the Day.</p><p>Camilla:    Take Courage, Hunter, the Savage is dead.</p><p>Katherine Tofts, the daughter of a person in the family of Bishop
Burnet, had great natural charms of voice, person, and manner. Playing
with Nicolini, singing English to his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec22.txt')">Italian</a>, she was the first of our
'prime donne' in Italian Opera. Mrs. Tofts had made much money when
in 1709 she quitted the stage with disordered intellect; her voice being
then unbroken, and her beauty in the height of its bloom. Having
recovered health, she married Mr. Joseph Smith, a rich patron of arts
and collector of books and engravings, with whom she went to Venice,
when he was sent thither as English Consul. Her madness afterwards
returned, she lived, therefore, says Sir J. Hawkins,</p><p>'sequestered from the world in a remote part of the house, and had a
large garden to range in, in which she would frequently walk, singing
and giving way to that innocent frenzy which had seized her in the
earlier part of her life.'</p><p>She identified herself with the great princesses whose loves and sorrows
she had represented in her youth, and died about the year 1760.]</p><p>
[Footnote 4: The 'Emperor of the Moon' is a farce, from the French,
by Mrs. Aphra Behn, first acted in London in 1687. It was originally
Italian, and had run 80 nights in Paris as 'Harlequin I'Empereur dans
le Monde de la Lune'. In Act II. sc. 3,</p><p>'The Front of the Scene is only a Curtain or Hangings to be drawn up
at Pleasure.'</p><p>Various gay masqueraders, interrupted by return of the Doctor, are
carried by Scaramouch behind the curtain. The Doctor enters in wrath,
vowing he has heard fiddles. Presently the curtain is drawn up and
discovers where Scaramouch has</p><p>'plac'd them all in the Hanging in which they make the Figures, where
they stand without Motion in Postures.'</p><p>Scaramouch professes that the noise was made by putting up this piece of
Tapestry,</p><p>'the best in Italy for the Rareness of the Figures, sir.'</p><p>While the Doctor is admiring the new tapestry, said to have been sent
him as a gift, Harlequin, who is</p><p>'placed on a Tree in the Hangings, hits him on the 'Head with his
Truncheon.'</p><p>The place of a particular figure in the picture, with a hand on a tree,
is that supposed to be aspired to by the 'Spectator's' next
correspondent.]</p><p>
[Footnote 5:  'The Fortune Hunters, or Two Fools Well Met,' a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec22.txt')">Comedy</a>
first produced in 1685, was the only work of James Carlile, a player who
quitted the stage to serve King William III. in the Irish Wars, and was
killed at the battle of Aghrim. The crowning joke of the second Act of
'the Fortune Hunters' is the return at night of Mr. Spruce, an Exchange
man, drunk and musical, to the garden-door of his house, when Mrs.
Spruce is just taking leave of young Wealthy. Wealthy hides behind the
pump. The drunken husband, who has been in a gutter, goes to the pump to
clean himself, and seizes a man's arm instead of a pump-handle. He works
it as a pump-handle, and complains that 'the pump's dry;' upon which
Young Wealthy empties a bottle of orange-flower water into his face.]</p><p>
[Footnote 6: In the third act of Fletcher's comedy of the 'Pilgrim',
Pedro, the Pilgrim, a noble gentleman, has shown to him the interior of
a Spanish mad-house, and discovers in it his mistress Alinda, who,
disguised in a boy's dress, was found in the town the night before a
little crazed, distracted, and so sent thither. The scene here shows
various shapes of madness,</p><p>Some of pity
That it would make ye melt to see their passions,
And some as light again.</p><p>One is an English madman who cries, 'Give me some drink,'</p><p>Fill me a thousand pots and froth 'em, froth 'em!</p><p>Upon which a keeper says:</p><p>Those English are so malt-mad, there's no meddling with 'em.
When they've a fruitful year of barley there,
All the whole Island's thus.</p><p>We read in the text how they had produced on the stage of Drury Lane
that madman on the previous Saturday night; this Essay appearing on the
breakfast tables upon Monday morning.]</p><p>
[Footnote 7: horse]</p><p>
[Footnote 8: King Latinus to Turnus in Act II., sc. 10, of the opera of
'Camilla'. Posterity will never know in whose person 'Latinus, king of
Latium and of the Volscians,' abdicated his crown at the opera to take
the Queen of England's shilling. It is the only character to which, in
the opera book, no name of a performer is attached. It is a part of
sixty or seventy lines in tyrant's vein; but all recitative. The King of
Latium was not once called upon for a song.]</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>
