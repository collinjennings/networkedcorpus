<p>No. 229.               Thursday, Nov. 22, 1711.             Addison.</p><p></p><p>--Spirat adhuc amor,
Vivuntque commissi calores
Æoliæ fidibus puellæ.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Among the many famous Pieces of Antiquity which are still to be seen at
_Rome_, there is the Trunk of a Statue [1] which has lost the Arms,
Legs, and Head; but discovers such an exquisite Workmanship in what
remains of it, that _Michael Angelo_ declared he had learned his whole
Art from it. Indeed he studied it so attentively, that he made most of
his Statues, and even his Pictures in that _Gusto_, to make use of the
_Italian_ Phrase; for which Reason this maimed Statue is still called
_Michael Angelo's_ School.</p><p>A Fragment of _Sappho_, which I design for the Subject of this Paper,
[2] is in as great Reputation among the Poets and Criticks, as the
mutilated Figure above-mentioned is among the Statuaries and Painters.
Several of our Countrymen, and Mr. _Dryden_ in particular, seem very
often to have copied after it in their Dramatick Writings; and in their
Poems upon <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec229.txt')">Love</a>.</p><p>Whatever might have been the Occasion of this Ode, the English <a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec229.txt')">Reader</a>
will enter into the Beauties of it, if he supposes it to have been
written in the Person of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec229.txt')">Lover</a> sitting by his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec229.txt')">Mistress</a>. I shall set to
View three different Copies of this beautiful Original: The first is a
Translation by _Catullus_, the second by Monsieur _Boileau_, and the
last by a Gentleman whose Translation of the _Hymn to Venus_ has been so
deservedly admired.</p><p>

My learned Reader will know very well the Reason why one of these Verses
is printed in _Roman_ Letter; [3] and if he compares this Translation
with the Original, will find that the three first Stanzas are rendred
almost Word for Word, and not only with the same Elegance, but with the
same short Turn of Expression which is so remarkable in the _Greek_, and
so peculiar to the _Sapphick_ Ode. I cannot imagine for what Reason
Madam _Dacier_ has told us, that this Ode of _Sappho_ is preserved
entire in _Longinus_, since it is manifest to any one who looks into
that <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec229.txt')">Authors</a> Quotation of it, that there must at least have been
another Stanza, which is not transmitted to us.</p><p>The second Translation of this Fragment which I shall here cite, is that
of Monsieur _Boileau_.</p><p>
Heureux! qui prés de toi, pour toi seule soûpire:
Qui jouït du plaisir de tentendre parler:
Qui te voit quelquefois doucement lui soûrire.
Les Dieux, dans son bonheur, peuvent-ils légaler?</p><p>Je sens de veine en veine une subtile flamme
Courir par tout mon corps, si-tost que je te vois:
Et dans les doux transports, où segare mon ame,
Je ne sçaurois trouver de langue, ni de voix.</p><p>Un nuage confus se répand sùr ma vuë,
Je nentens plus, je tombe en de douces langueurs;
Et pâle, sans haleine, interdite, esperduë,
Un frisson me saisit, je tremble, je me meurs.</p><p>
The Reader will see that this is rather an Imitation than a Translation.
The Circumstances do not lie so thick together, and follow one another
with that Vehemence and Emotion as in the Original. In short, Monsieur
_Boileau_ has given us all the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec229.txt')">Poetry</a>, but not all the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec229.txt')">Passion</a> of this
famous Fragment. I shall, in the last Place, present my Reader with the
_English_ Translation.</p><p>
I.   Blest as th'immortal Gods is he,
The Youth who fondly sits by thee,
And hears and sees thee all the while
Softly speak and sweetly smile.</p><p>II.   Twas this deprived my Soul of Rest,
And raised such Tumults in my Breast;
For while I gaz'd, in Transport tost,
My Breath was gone, my Voice was lost:</p><p>III. My Bosom glowed; the subtle Flame
Ran quick through all my vital Frame;
O'er my dim Eyes a Darkness hung;
My Ears with hollow Murmurs rung.</p><p>IV.  In dewy Damps my Limbs were child;
My Blood with gentle Horrors thrill'd;
My feeble Pulse forgot to play;
I fainted, sunk, and dy'd away.</p><p>
Instead of giving any Character of this last Translation, I shall desire
my learned Reader to look into the Criticisms which _Longinus_ has made
upon the Original. By that means he will know to which of the
Translations he ought to give the Preference. I shall only add, that
this Translation is written in the very Spirit of _Sappho_, and as near
the _Greek_ as the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec229.txt')">Genius</a> of our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec229.txt')">Language</a> will possibly suffer.</p><p>_Longinus_ has observed, that this Description of Love in _Sappho_ is an
exact Copy of Nature, and that all the Circumstances which follow one
another in such an Hurry of Sentiments, notwithstanding they appear
repugnant to each other, are really such as happen in the Phrenzies of
Love.</p><p>I wonder, that not one of the Criticks or Editors, through whose Hands
this Ode has passed, has taken Occasion from it to mention a
Circumstance related by _Plutarch_. That <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec229.txt')">Author</a> in the famous Story of
_Antiochus_, who fell in Love with _Stratonice_, his Mother-in-law, and
(not daring to discover his Passion) pretended to be confined to his Bed
by Sickness, tells us, that _Erasistratus_, the Physician, found out the
Nature of his Distemper by those Symptoms of Love which he had learnt
from _Sappho's_ Writings. [4] _Stratonice_ was in the Room of the
Love-sick Prince, when these Symptoms discovered themselves to his
Physician; and it is probable, that they were not very different from
those which _Sappho_ here describes in a Lover sitting by his Mistress.
This Story of _Antiochus_ is so well known, that I need not add the
Sequel of it, which has no Relation to my present Subject.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: The Belvidere Torso.]</p><p>

[Footnote 4: In Plutarch's Life of Demetrius.</p><p>When others entered Antiochus was entirely unaffected. But when
Stratonice came in, as she often did, he shewed all the symptoms
described by Sappho, the faltering voice, the burning blush, the
languid eye, the sudden sweat, the tumultuous pulse; and at length,
the passion overcoming his spirits, a swoon and mortal paleness.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
