<p>No. 236.                Friday, November 30, 1711.              Steele</p><p></p><p>--Dare Jura maritis.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>You have not spoken in so direct a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec236.txt')">manner</a> upon the Subject of
<a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec236.txt')">Marriage</a> as that important Case deserves. It would not be improper to
observe upon the Peculiarity in the Youth of _<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec236.txt')">Great</a> Britain_, of
railing and laughing at that Institution; and when they fall into it,
from a profligate Habit of Mind, being insensible of the [Satisfaction
[1]] in that Way of Life, and treating their Wives with the most
barbarous Disrespect.</p><p>Particular Circumstances and Cast of Temper, must teach a Man the
Probability of mighty Uneasinesses in that State, (for unquestionably
some there are whose very Dispositions are strangely averse to
conjugal Friendship;) but no one, I believe, is by his own natural
Complexion prompted to teaze and torment another for no Reason but
being nearly allied to him: And can there be any thing more base, or
serve to sink a Man so much below his own distinguishing
Characteristick, (I mean Reason) than returning Evil for Good in so
open a Manner, as that of treating an helpless Creature with
Unkindness, who has had so good an Opinion of him as to believe what
he said relating to one of the greatest Concerns of Life, by
delivering her Happiness in this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec236.txt')">World</a> to his Care and Protection?
Must not that Man be abandoned even to all manner of Humanity, who can
deceive a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec236.txt')">Woman</a> with Appearances of Affection and Kindness, for no
other End but to torment her with more Ease and Authority? Is any
Thing more unlike a Gentleman, than when his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec236.txt')">Honour</a> is engaged for the
performing his Promises, because nothing but that can oblige him to
it, to become afterwards false to his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec236.txt')">Word</a>, and be alone the Occasion
of Misery to one whose Happiness he but lately pretended was dearer to
him than his own? Ought such a one to be trusted in his common
Affairs? or treated but as one whose Honesty consisted only in his
Incapacity of being otherwise?</p><p>There is one Cause of this Usage no less absurd than common, which
takes place among the more unthinking Men: and that is the Desire to
appear to their Friends free and at Liberty, and without those
Trammels they have so much ridiculed. [To avoid [2]] this they fly
into the other Extream, and grow Tyrants that they may seem Masters.
Because an uncontroulable Command of their own Actions is a certain
Sign of entire Dominion, they wont so much as recede from the
Government even in one Muscle, of their Faces. A kind Look they
believe would be fawning, and a civil Answer yielding the Superiority.
To this must we attribute an Austerity they betray in every Action:
What but this can put a Man out of Humour in his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec236.txt')">Wife</a>'s <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec236.txt')">Company</a>, tho
he is so distinguishingly pleasant every where else? The Bitterness of
his Replies, and the Severity of his Frowns to the tenderest of Wives,
clearly demonstrate, that an ill-grounded Fear of being thought too
submissive, is at the Bottom of this, as I am willing to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec236.txt')">call</a> it,
affected Moroseness; but if it be such only, put on to convince his
Acquaintance of his entire Dominion, let him take Care of the
Consequence, which will be certain, and worse than the present Evil;
his seeming Indifference will by Degrees grow into real Contempt, and
if it doth not wholly alienate the Affections of his Wife for ever
from him, make both him and her more miserable than if it really did
so.</p><p>However inconsistent it may appear, to be thought a well-bred Person
has no small Share in this clownish <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec236.txt')">Behaviour</a>: A Discourse therefore
relating to good Breeding towards a loving and a tender Wife, would be
of great Use to this Sort of Gentlemen. Could you but once convince
them, that to be civil at least is not beneath the Character of a
Gentleman, nor even tender Affection towards one who would make it
reciprocal, betrays any Softness or Effeminacy that the most masculine
Disposition need be ashamed of; could you satisfy them of the
Generosity of voluntary Civility, and the Greatness of Soul that is
conspicuous in Benevolence without immediate Obligations; could you
recommend to Peoples Practice the Saying of the Gentleman quoted in
one of your Speculations, _That he thought it incumbent upon him to
make the Inclinations of a Woman of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec236.txt')">Merit</a> go along with her Duty_:
Could you, I say, perswade these Men of the Beauty and Reasonableness
of this Sort of Behaviour, I have so much Charity for some of them at
least, to believe you would convince them of a Thing they are only
ashamed to allow: Besides, you would recommend that State in its
truest, and consequently its most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec236.txt')">agreeable</a> Colours; and the Gentlemen
who have for any Time been such professed Enemies to it, when Occasion
should serve, would return you their Thanks for assisting their
Interest in prevailing over their Prejudices. Marriage in general
would by this Means be a more easy and comfortable Condition; the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec236.txt')">Husband</a> would be no where so well satisfied as in his own Parlour, nor
the Wife so pleasant as in the Company of her Husband: A Desire of
being agreeable in the Lover would be increased in the Husband, and
the Mistress be more amiable by becoming the Wife. Besides all which,
I am apt to believe we should find the Race of Men grow wiser as their
Progenitors grew kinder, and the Affection of the Parents would be
conspicuous in the Wisdom of their Children; in short, Men would in
general be much better humoured than they are, did not they so
frequently exercise the worst Turns of their Temper where they ought
to exert the best.</p><p></p><p>MR. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a Woman who left the Admiration of this whole Town, to throw
myself ([for [3]] <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec236.txt')">Love</a> of Wealth) into the Arms of a Fool. When I
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec236.txt')">married</a> him, I could have had any one of several Men of Sense who
languished for me; but my Case is just. I believed my superior
Understanding would form him into a tractable Creature. But, alas, my
Spouse has Cunning and Suspicion, the inseparable Companions of little
Minds; and every Attempt I make to divert, by putting on an agreeable
Air, a sudden Chearfulness, or kind Behaviour, he looks upon as the
first Act towards an Insurrection against his undeserved Dominion over
me. Let every one who is still to chuse, and hopes to govern a Fool,
remember</p><p>TRISTISSA.</p><p></p><p>_St. Martins, November_ 25.</p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>This is to complain of an evil Practice which I think very well
deserves a Redress, though you have not as yet taken any Notice of it:
If you mention it in your Paper, it may perhaps have a very good
Effect. What I mean is the Disturbance some <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec236.txt')">People</a> give to others at
Church, by their Repetition of the Prayers after the Minister, and
that not only in the Prayers, but also the Absolution and the
Commandments fare no better, winch are in a particular Manner the
Priests Office: This I have known done in so audible a manner, that
sometimes their Voices have been as loud as his. As little as you
would think it, this is frequently done by People seemingly devout.
This irreligious Inadvertency is a Thing extremely offensive: But I do
not recommend it as a Thing I give you Liberty to ridicule, but hope
it may be amended by the bare Mention.</p><p>_SIR,
Your very humble Servant,
T.S._</p><p>
