<p>No. 240.           Wednesday, December 5, 1711.                  Steele.</p><p></p><p>--Aliter not fit, Avite, liber.</p><p>Mart.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am of one of the most genteel Trades in the City, and understand
thus much of liberal Education, as to have an ardent <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec240.txt')">Ambition</a> of being
useful to Mankind, and to think That the chief End of Being as to this
Life. I had these good Impressions given me from the handsome
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec240.txt')">Behaviour</a> of a learned, generous, and wealthy Man towards me when I
first began the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec240.txt')">World</a>. Some Dissatisfaction between me and my Parents
made me enter into it with less Relish of Business than I ought; and
to turn off this Uneasiness I gave my self to criminal Pleasures, some
Excesses, and a general loose Conduct. I know not what the excellent
Man above-mentioned saw in me, but he descended from the Superiority
of his Wisdom and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec240.txt')">Merit</a>, to throw himself frequently into my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec240.txt')">Company</a>.
This made me soon hope that I had something in me worth cultivating,
and his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec240.txt')">Conversation</a> made me sensible of Satisfactions in a regular
Way, which I had never before imagined. When he was grown familiar
with me, he opened himself like a good Angel, and told me, he had long
laboured to ripen me into a Preparation to receive his Friendship and
Advice, both which I should daily command, and the Use of any <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec240.txt')">Part</a> of
his Fortune, to apply the Measures he should propose to me, for the
Improvement of my own. I assure you, I cannot recollect the Goodness
and Confusion of the good Man when he spoke to this Purpose to me,
without melting into Tears; but in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec240.txt')">word</a>, Sir, I must hasten to tell
you, that my Heart burns with Gratitude towards him, and he is so
happy a Man, that it can never be in my Power to return him his
Favours in Kind, but I am sure I have made him the most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec240.txt')">agreeable</a>
Satisfaction I could possibly, [in being ready to serve others to my
utmost Ability,] as far as is consistent with the Prudence he
prescribes to me. Dear Mr. SPECTATOR, I do not owe to him only the
good Will and Esteem of my own Relations, (who are <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec240.txt')">People</a> of
Distinction) the present Ease and Plenty of my Circumstances, but also
the Government of my Passions, and Regulation of my Desires. I doubt
not, Sir, but in your Imagination such Virtues as these of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec240.txt')">worthy</a>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec240.txt')">Friend</a>, bear as <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec240.txt')">great</a> a Figure as Actions which are more glittering in
the common Estimation. What I would ask of you, is to give us a whole
_Spectator_ upon Heroick Virtue in common Life, which may incite Men
to the same generous Inclinations, as have by this admirable Person
been shewn to, and rais'd in,</p><p>_SIR, Your most humble Servant_.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a Country Gentleman, of a good plentiful Estate, and live as the
rest of my Neighbours with great Hospitality. I have been ever
reckoned among the Ladies the best Company in the World, and have
Access as a sort of Favourite. I never came in Publick but I saluted
them, tho in great Assemblies, all round, where it was seen how
genteelly I avoided hampering my Spurs in their Petticoats, while I
moved amongst them; and on the other side how prettily they curtsied
and received me, standing in proper Rows, and advancing as fast as
they saw their Elders, or their Betters, dispatch'd by me. But so it
is, Mr. SPECTATOR, that all our good Breeding is of late lost by the
unhappy Arrival of a Courtier, or Town Gentleman, who came lately
among us: This Person where-ever he came into a Room made a profound
Bow, and fell back, then recovered with a soft Air, and made a Bow to
the next, and so to one or two more, and then took the Gross of the
Room, by passing by them in a continued Bow till he arrived at the
Person he thought proper particularly to entertain. This he did with
so good a Grace and Assurance, that it is taken for the present
Fashion; and there is no young Gentlewoman within several Miles of
this Place has been kissed ever since his first Appearance among us.
We Country Gentlemen cannot begin again and learn these fine and
reserved Airs; and our Conversation is at a Stand, till we have your
Judgment for or against Kissing, by way of Civility or Salutation;
which is impatiently expected by your Friends of both Sexes, but by
none so much as</p><p>_Your humble Servant_,</p><p>Rustick Sprightly.</p><p></p><p>_December_ 3, 1711.</p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I was the other Night at _Philaster_,[1] where I expected to hear your
famous Trunk-maker, but was happily disappointed of his Company, and
saw another Person who had the like Ambition to distinguish himself in
a noisy <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec240.txt')">manner</a>, partly by Vociferation or talking loud, and partly by
his bodily Agility. This was a very lusty Fellow, but withal a sort of
Beau, who getting into one of the Side-boxes on the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec240.txt')">Stage</a> before the
Curtain drew, was disposed to shew the whole <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec240.txt')">Audience</a> his Activity by
leaping over the Spikes; he pass'd from thence to one of the entering
Doors, where he took Snuff with a tolerable good Grace, display'd his
fine Cloaths, made two or three feint Passes at the Curtain with his
Cane, then faced about and appear'd at tother Door: Here he affected
to survey the whole House, bow'd and smil'd at random, and then shew'd
his Teeth, which were some of them indeed very white: After this he
retired behind the Curtain, and obliged us with several Views of his
Person from every Opening.</p><p>During the Time of Acting, he appear'd frequently in the Princes
Apartment, made one at the Hunting-match, and was very forward in the
Rebellion. If there were no Injunctions to the contrary, yet this
Practice must be confess'd to diminish the Pleasure of the Audience,
and for that Reason presumptuous and unwarrantable: But since her
Majesty's late Command has made it criminal,[2] you have Authority to
take Notice of it.</p><p>SIR, _Your humble Servant_,</p><p>Charles Easy.</p><p>
T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Beaumont and Fletchers Philaster had been acted on the
preceding Friday, Nov. 30. The Hunt is in the Fourth <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec240.txt')">Act</a>, the Rebellion
in the Fifth.]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: At this time there had been added to the playbills the line</p><p>By her Majesty's Command no Person is to be admitted behind the
Scenes.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
