<p>No. 241.                 Thursday, December 6, 1711.            Addison.</p><p></p><p>--Semperque relinqui
Sola sibi, semper longam incomitata videtur
Ire viam--</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>Though you have considered virtuous <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec241.txt')">Love</a> inmost of its Distresses, I
do not remember that you have given us any Dissertation upon the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec241.txt')">Absence</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec241.txt')">Lovers</a>, or laid down any Methods how they should support
themselves under those long Separations which they are sometimes
forced to undergo. I am at present in this unhappy Circumstance,
having parted with the best of Husbands, who is abroad in the Service
of his Country, and may not possibly return for some Years. His warm
and generous Affection while we were together, with the Tenderness
which he expressed to me at parting, make his Absence almost
insupportable. I think of him every Moment of the Day, and meet him
every Night in my Dreams. Every thing I see puts me in mind of him. I
apply myself with more than ordinary Diligence to the Care of his
Family and his Estate; but this, instead of relieving me, gives me but
so many Occasions of wishing for his Return. I frequent the Rooms
where I used to converse with him, and not meeting him there, sit down
in his Chair, and fall a weeping. I love to read the Books he
delighted in, and to converse with the Persons whom he esteemed. I
visit his Picture a hundred times a Day, and place myself over-against
it whole Hours together. I pass a great part of my Time in the Walks
where I used to lean upon his Arm, and recollect in my Mind the
Discourses which have there passed between us: I look over the several
Prospects and Points of View which we used to survey together, fix my
Eye upon the Objects which he has made me take notice of, and <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec241.txt')">call</a> to
mind a thousand [<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec241.txt')">agreeable</a>] Remarks which he has made on those
Occasions. I write to him by every Conveyance, and contrary to other
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec241.txt')">People</a>, am always in good Humour when an East-Wind blows, because it
seldom fails of bringing me a Letter from him. Let me entreat you,
Sir, to give me your Advice upon this Occasion, and to let me know how
I may relieve my self in this my Widowhood.</p><p>_I am, SIR, Your most humble Servant_,</p><p>ASTERIA.</p><p>
Absence is what the Poets call Death in Love, and has given Occasion to
abundance of beautiful Complaints in those <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec241.txt')">Authors</a> who have treated of
this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec241.txt')">Passion</a> in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec241.txt')">Verse</a>. _Ovid's_ Epistles are full of them. _Otway's
Monimia_ talks very tenderly upon this Subject. [1]</p><p>--It was not <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec241.txt')">kind</a>
To leave me like a Turtle, here alone,
To droop and mourn the Absence of my Mate._
_When thou art from me, every Place is desert:
And I, methinks, am savage and forlorn.
Thy Presence only tis can make me blest,
Heal my unquiet Mind, and tune my Soul.</p><p>The Consolations of Lovers on these Occasions are very extraordinary.
Besides those mentioned by _Asteria_, there are many other Motives of
Comfort, which are made use of by absent Lovers.</p><p>I remember in one of _Scudery's_ Romances, a Couple of honourable Lovers
agreed at their parting to set aside one half Hour in the Day to think
of each other during a tedious Absence. The Romance tells us, that they
both of them punctually observed the Time thus agreed upon; and that
whatever <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec241.txt')">Company</a> or Business they were engaged in, they left it abruptly
as soon as the Clock warned them to retire. The Romance further adds,
That the Lovers expected the Return of this stated Hour with as much
Impatience, as if it had been a real Assignation, and enjoyed an
imaginary Happiness that was almost as pleasing to them as what they
would have found from a real Meeting. It was an inexpressible
Satisfaction to these divided Lovers, to be assured that each was at the
same time employ'd in the same kind of Contemplation, and making equal
Returns of Tenderness and Affection.</p><p>If I may be allowed to mention a more serious Expedient for the
alleviating of Absence, I shall take notice of one which I have known
two Persons practise, who joined Religion to that Elegance of Sentiments
with which the Passion of Love generally inspires its Votaries. This
was, at the Return of such an Hour, to offer up a certain Prayer for
each other, which they had agreed upon before their Parting. The
Husband, who is a Man that makes a Figure in the polite World, as well
as in his own Family, has often told me, that he could not have
supported an Absence of three Years without this Expedient.</p><p>[_Strada_, in one of his Prolusions, [2]] gives an Account of a
chimerical Correspondence between two Friends by the Help of a certain
Loadstone, which had such Virtue in it, that if it touched two several
Needles, when one of the Needles so touched [began [3]], to move, the
other, tho at never so great a Distance, moved at the same Time, and in
the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec241.txt')">Manner</a>. He tells us, that the two Friends, being each of them
possessed of one of these Needles, made a kind of a Dial-plate,
inscribing it with the four and twenty Letters, in the same manner as
the Hours of the Day are marked upon the ordinary Dial-plate. They then
fixed one of the Needles on each of these Plates in such a manner, that
it could move round without Impediment, so as to touch any of the four
and twenty Letters. Upon their Separating from one another into distant
Countries, they agreed to withdraw themselves punctually into their
Closets at a certain Hour of the Day, and to converse with one another
by means of this their Invention. Accordingly when they were some
hundred Miles asunder, each of them shut himself up in his Closet at the
Time appointed, and immediately cast his Eye upon his Dial-plate. If he
had a mind to write any thing to his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec241.txt')">Friend</a>, he directed his Needle to
every Letter that formed the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec241.txt')">Words</a> which he had occasion for, making a
little Pause at the end of every <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec241.txt')">Word</a> or Sentence, to avoid Confusion.
The Friend, in the mean while, saw his own sympathetick Needle moving of
itself to every Letter which that of his Correspondent pointed at. By
this means they talked together across a whole Continent, and conveyed
their Thoughts to one another in an Instant over Cities or Mountains,
Seas or Desarts.</p><p>If Monsieur _Scudery_, or any other Writer of Romance, had introduced a
Necromancer, who is generally in the Train of a Knight-Errant, making a
Present to two Lovers of a Couple of those above-mentioned Needles, the
Reader would not have been a little pleased to have seen them
corresponding with one another when they were guarded by Spies and
Watches, or separated by Castles and Adventures.</p><p>In the mean while, if ever this Invention should be revived or put in
practice, I would propose, that upon the Lovers Dial-plate there should
be written not only the four and twenty Letters, but several entire
Words which have always a Place in passionate Epistles, as _Flames,
Darts, Die, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec241.txt')">Language</a>, Absence, Cupid, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec241.txt')">Heart</a>, Eyes, Hang, Drown_, and the
like. This would very much abridge the Lovers Pains in this way of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec241.txt')">writing</a> a Letter, as it would enable him to express the most useful and
significant Words with a single Touch of the Needle.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Orphan, Act II.]</p><p>
