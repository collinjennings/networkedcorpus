<p>No. 243.              Saturday, December 8, 1711.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>Formam quidem ipsam, Marce fili, et tanquam faciem Honesti vides: quæ
si oculis cerneretur, mirabiles amores (ut ait Plato) excitaret
Sapientiæ.</p><p>
Tull. Offic.</p><p></p><p>I do not remember to have read any Discourse written expressly upon the
Beauty and Loveliness of <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec243.txt')">Virtue</a>, without considering it as a Duty, and
as the Means of making us happy both now and hereafter. I design
therefore this Speculation as an Essay upon that Subject, in which I
shall consider Virtue no further than as it is in it self of an amiable
Nature, after having premised, that I understand by the Word Virtue such
a general Notion as is affixed to it by the Writers of Morality, and
which by devout Men generally goes under the Name of Religion, and by
Men of the World under the Name of Honour.</p><p>Hypocrisy it self does great Honour, or rather Justice, to Religion, and
tacitly acknowledges it to be an Ornament to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec243.txt')">human</a> Nature. The Hypocrite
would not be at so much Pains to put on the Appearance of Virtue, if he
did not know it was the most proper and effectual means to gain the Love
and Esteem of Mankind.</p><p>We learn from _Hierodes_, it was a common Saying among the Heathens,
that the Wise Man hates no body, but only loves the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec243.txt')">Virtuous</a>.</p><p>_Tully_ has a very beautiful Gradation of Thoughts to shew how amiable
Virtue is. We love a virtuous Man, says he, who lives in the remotest
Parts of the Earth, though we are altogether out of the Reach of his
Virtue, and can receive from it no Manner of Benefit; nay, one who died
several Ages ago, raises a <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec243.txt')">secret</a> Fondness and Benevolence for him in
our Minds, when we read his Story: Nay, what is still more, one who has
been the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec243.txt')">Enemy</a> of our Country, provided his Wars were regulated by
Justice and Humanity, as in the Instance of _Pyrrhus_ whom _Tully_
mentions on this Occasion in Opposition to _Hannibal_. Such is the
natural Beauty and Loveliness of Virtue.</p><p>Stoicism, which was the Pedantry of Virtue, ascribes all good
Qualifications, of what kind soever, to the virtuous Man. Accordingly
[Cato][1] in the Character _Tully_ has left of him, carried Matters so
far, that he would not allow any one but a virtuous Man to be handsome.
This indeed looks more like a Philosophical Rant than the real Opinion
of a Wise Man; yet this was what _Cato_ very seriously maintained. In
short, the Stoics thought they could not sufficiently represent the
Excellence of Virtue, if they did not comprehend in the Notion of it all
possible Perfection[s]; and therefore did not only suppose, that it was
transcendently beautiful in it self, but that it made the very Body
amiable, and banished every kind of Deformity from the Person in whom it
resided.</p><p>It is a common Observation, that the most abandoned to all Sense of
Goodness, are apt to wish those who are related to them of a different
Character; and it is very observable, that none are more struck with the
Charms of Virtue in the fair Sex, than those who by their very
Admiration of it are carried to a Desire of ruining it.</p><p>A virtuous Mind in a fair Body is indeed a fine Picture in a good Light,
and therefore it is no Wonder that it makes the beautiful Sex all over
Charms.</p><p>As Virtue in general is of an amiable and lovely Nature, there are some
particular kinds of it which are more so than others, and these are such
as dispose us to do Good to Mankind. Temperance and Abstinence, Faith
and Devotion, are in themselves perhaps as laudable as any other
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec243.txt')">Virtues</a>; but those which make a Man popular and beloved, are Justice,
Charity, Munificence, and, in short, all the good Qualities that render
us beneficial to each other. For which Reason even an extravagant Man,
who has nothing else to recommend him but a false Generosity, is often
more beloved and esteemed than a Person of a much more finished
Character, who is defective in this Particular.</p><p>The two great Ornaments of Virtue, which shew her in the most
advantageous Views, and make her altogether lovely, are Chearfulness and
Good-Nature. These generally go together, as a Man cannot be agreeable
to others who is not easy within himself. They are both very requisite
in a virtuous Mind, to keep out Melancholy from the many serious
Thoughts it is engaged in, and to hinder its natural Hatred of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec243.txt')">Vice</a> from
souring into Severity and Censoriousness.</p><p>If Virtue is of this amiable Nature, what can we think of those who can
look upon it with an Eye of Hatred and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec243.txt')">Ill</a>-will, or can suffer their
Aversion for a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec243.txt')">Party</a> to blot out all the Merit of the Person who is
engaged in it. A Man must be excessively stupid, as well as
uncharitable, who believes that there is no Virtue but on his own Side,
and that there are not Men as honest as himself who may differ from him
in Political Principles. Men may oppose one another in some Particulars,
but ought not to carry their Hatred to those Qualities which are of so
amiable a Nature in themselves, and have nothing to do with the Points
in Dispute. Men of Virtue, though of different Interests, ought to
consider themselves as more nearly united with one another, than with
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec243.txt')">vicious</a> Part of Mankind, who embark with them in the same civil
Concerns. We should bear the same Love towards a Man of Honour, who is a
living Antagonist, which _Tully_ tells us in the forementioned Passage
every one naturally does to an Enemy that is dead. In short, we should
esteem Virtue though in a Foe, and abhor Vice though in a Friend.</p><p>I speak this with an Eye to those cruel Treatments which Men of all
Sides are apt to give the Characters of those who do not agree with
them. How many Persons of undoubted Probity, and exemplary Virtue, on
either Side, are blackned and defamed? How many Men of Honour exposed to
publick Obloquy and Reproach? Those therefore who are either the
Instruments or Abettors in such Infernal Dealings, ought to be looked
upon as Persons who make use of Religion to promote their Cause, not of
their Cause to promote Religion.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [we find that _Cato_,]]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
