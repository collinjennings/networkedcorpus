<p>No. 247.              Thursday, December 13, 1711.             Addison.</p><p></p><p>[Greek:--Tôn d akámatos rhéei audàe Ek stomátôn haedeia--Hes.]</p><p></p><p>We are told by some antient Authors, that _Socrates_ was instructed in
Eloquence by a <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec247.txt')">Woman</a>, whose Name, if I am not mistaken, was _Aspasia_. I
have indeed very often looked upon that <a name="topic23" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec247.txt')">Art</a> as the most proper for the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec247.txt')">Female</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec247.txt')">Sex</a>, and I think the Universities would do well to consider
whether they should not fill the Rhetorick Chairs with She Professors.</p><p>It has been said in the Praise of some Men, that they could Talk whole
Hours together upon any Thing; but it must be owned to the Honour of the
other Sex, that there are many among them who can Talk whole Hours
together upon Nothing. I have known a Woman branch out into a long
Extempore Dissertation upon the Edging of a Petticoat, and chide her
Servant for breaking a China Cup, in all the Figures of Rhetorick.</p><p>Were <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec247.txt')">Women</a> admitted to plead in Courts of Judicature, I am perswaded
they would carry the Eloquence of the Bar to greater Heights than it has
yet arrived at. If any one doubts this, let him but be present at those
Debates which frequently arise among the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec247.txt')">Ladies</a> [of the [1]] _British_
Fishery.</p><p>The first Kind therefore of Female Orators which I shall take notice of,
are those who are employed in stirring up the Passions, a Part of
Rhetorick in which _Socrates_ his <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec247.txt')">Wife</a> had perhaps made a greater
Proficiency than his above-mentioned Teacher.</p><p>The second Kind of Female Orators are those who deal in Invectives, and
who are commonly known by the Name of the Censorious. The Imagination
and Elocution of this Set of Rhetoricians is wonderful. With what a
Fluency of Invention, and Copiousness of Expression, will they enlarge
upon every little Slip in the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec247.txt')">Behaviour</a> of another? With how many
different Circumstances, and with what Variety of Phrases, will they
tell over the same Story? I have known an old <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec247.txt')">Lady</a> make an unhappy
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec247.txt')">Marriage</a> the Subject of a Months <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec247.txt')">Conversation</a>. She blamed the Bride in
one Place; pitied her in another; laughed at her in a third; wondered at
her in a fourth; was angry with her in a fifth; and in short, wore out a
Pair of Coach-Horses in expressing her Concern for her. At length, after
having quite exhausted the Subject on this Side, she made a Visit to the
new-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec247.txt')">married</a> Pair, praised the Wife for the prudent Choice she had made,
told her the unreasonable Reflections which some malicious <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec247.txt')">People</a> had
cast upon her, and desired that they might be better acquainted. The
Censure and Approbation of this Kind of Women are therefore only to be
consider'd as Helps to Discourse.</p><p>A third Kind of Female Orators may be comprehended under the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec247.txt')">Word</a>
_Gossips_. Mrs. _Fiddle Faddle_ is perfectly accomplished in this Sort
of Eloquence; she launches out into Descriptions of Christenings, runs
Divisions upon an Headdress, knows every Dish of Meat that is served up
in her Neighbourhood, and entertains her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec247.txt')">Company</a> a whole Afternoon
together with the Wit of her little Boy, before he is able to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec247.txt')">speak</a>.</p><p>The Coquet may be looked upon as a fourth Kind of Female Orator. To give
her self the larger Field for Discourse, she hates and loves in the same
Breath, talks to her Lap-dog or Parrot, is uneasy in all kinds of
Weather, and in every Part of the Room: She has false Quarrels and
feigned Obligations to all the Men of her Acquaintance; sighs when she
is not sad, and Laughs when she is not Merry. The Coquet is in
particular a great Mistress of that Part of Oratory which is called
Action, and indeed seems to speak for no other Purpose, but as it gives
her an Opportunity of stirring a Limb, or varying a Feature, of glancing
her Eyes, or playing with her Fan.</p><p>As for News-mongers, Politicians, Mimicks, Story-Tellers, with other
Characters of that nature, which give Birth to Loquacity, they are as
commonly found among the Men as the Women; for which Reason I shall pass
them over in Silence.</p><p>I have often been puzzled to assign a Cause why Women should have this
Talent of a ready Utterance in so much greater Perfection than Men. I
have sometimes fancied that they have not a retentive Power, or the
Faculty of suppressing their Thoughts, as Men have, but that they are
necessitated to speak every Thing they think, and if so, it would
perhaps furnish a very strong Argument to the _Cartesians_, for the
supporting of their [Doctrine,[2]] that the Soul always thinks. But as
several are of Opinion that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec247.txt')">Fair</a> Sex are not altogether Strangers to
the Art of Dissembling and concealing their Thoughts, I have been forced
to relinquish that Opinion, and have therefore endeavoured to seek after
some better Reason. In order to it, a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec247.txt')">Friend</a> of mine, who is an
excellent Anatomist, has promised me by the first Opportunity to dissect
a Woman's Tongue, and to examine whether there may not be in it certain
Juices which render it so wonderfully voluble [or [3]] flippant, or
whether the Fibres of it may not be made up of a finer or more pliant
Thread, or whether there are not in it some particular Muscles which
dart it up and down by such sudden Glances and Vibrations; or whether in
the last Place, there may not be certain undiscovered Channels running
from the Head and the Heart, to this little Instrument of Loquacity, and
conveying into it a perpetual Affluence of animal Spirits. Nor must I
omit the Reason which _Hudibras_ has given, why those who can talk on
Trifles speak with the greatest Fluency; namely, that the Tongue is like
a Race-Horse, which runs the faster the lesser Weight it carries.</p><p>Which of these Reasons soever may be looked upon as the most probable, I
think the _Irishman's_ Thought was very natural, who after some Hours
Conversation with a Female Orator, told her, that he believed her Tongue
was very glad when she was asleep, for that it had not a Moments Rest
all the while she was awake.</p><p>That excellent old Ballad of _The Wanton Wife of Bath_ has the following
remarkable Lines.</p><p>_I think, quoth_ Thomas, _Womens Tongues
Of Aspen Leaves are made._</p><p>And Ovid, though in the Description of a very barbarous Circumstance,
tells us, That when the Tongue of a beautiful Female was cut out, and
thrown upon the Ground, it could not forbear muttering even in that
Posture.</p><p>--Comprensam forcipe linguam
Abstulit ense fero. Radix micat ultima linguæ,
Ipsa jacet, terræque tremens immurmurat atræ;
Utque salire solet mutilatæ cauda colubræ
Palpitat:--[4]</p><p>If a tongue would be talking without a Mouth, what could it have done
when it had all its Organs of Speech, and Accomplices of Sound about it?
I might here mention the Story of the Pippin-Woman, had not I some
Reason to look upon it as fabulous.</p><p>I must confess I am so wonderfully charmed with the Musick of this
little Instrument, that I would by no Means discourage it. All that I
aim at by this Dissertation is, to cure it of several disagreeable
Notes, and in particular of those little Jarrings and Dissonances which
arise from Anger, Censoriousness, Gossiping and Coquetry. In short, I
would always have it tuned by Good-Nature, Truth, Discretion and
Sincerity.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: that belong to our]</p><p>
