<p>No. 248.               Friday, December 14, 1711.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>Hoc maximè Officii est, ut quisque maximè opis indigeat, ita ei
potissimùm opitulari.</p><p>Tull.</p><p></p><p>There are none who deserve Superiority over others in the Esteem of
Mankind, who do not make it their Endeavour to be beneficial to Society;
and who upon all Occasions which their Circumstances of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec248.txt')">Life</a> can
administer, do not take a certain unfeigned Pleasure in conferring
Benefits of one kind or other. Those whose <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec248.txt')">great</a> Talents and high Birth
have placed them in conspicuous Stations of Life, are indispensably
obliged to exert some noble Inclinations for the Service of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec248.txt')">World</a>,
or else such Advantages become Misfortunes, and Shade and Privacy are a
more eligible Portion. Where Opportunities and Inclinations are given to
the same Person, we sometimes see sublime Instances of Virtue, which so
dazzle our Imaginations, that we look with Scorn on all which in lower
Scenes of Life we may our selves be able to practise. But this is a
vicious Way of Thinking; and it bears some Spice of romantick Madness,
for a Man to imagine that he must grow ambitious, or seek Adventures, to
be able to do great Actions. It is in every Man's Power in the World who
is above meer <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec248.txt')">Poverty</a>, not only to do <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec248.txt')">Things</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec248.txt')">worthy</a> but heroick. The
great Foundation of civil Virtue is Self-Denial; and there is no one
above the Necessities of Life, but has Opportunities of exercising that
noble Quality, and doing as much as his Circumstances will bear for the
Ease and Convenience of other Men; and he who does more than ordinarily
Men practise upon such Occasions as occur in his Life, deserves the
Value of his Friends as if he had done Enterprizes which are usually
attended with the highest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec248.txt')">Glory</a>. Men of publick Spirit differ rather in
their Circumstances than their Virtue; and the Man who does all he can
in a low Station, is more [a[1]] Hero than he who omits any worthy
Action he is able to accomplish in a great one. It is not many Years ago
since _Lapirius_, in Wrong of his elder Brother, came to a great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec248.txt')">Estate</a>
by Gift of his Father, by reason of the dissolute <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec248.txt')">Behaviour</a> of the
First-born. Shame and Contrition reformed the Life of the disinherited
Youth, and he became as remarkable for his good Qualities as formerly
for his Errors. _Lapirius_, who observed his Brothers Amendment, sent
him on a New-Years Day in the Morning the following Letter:</p><p>_Honoured Brother,_</p><p>I enclose to you the Deeds whereby my Father gave me this House and
Land: Had he lived till now, he would not have bestowed it in that
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec248.txt')">Manner</a>; he took it from the Man you were, and I restore it to the Man
you are. I am,</p><p>_SIR,
Your affectionate Brother, and humble Servant,_
P. T.</p><p>As great and exalted Spirits undertake the Pursuit of hazardous Actions
for the Good of others, at the same Time gratifying their Passion for
Glory; so do worthy Minds in the domestick Way of Life deny themselves
many Advantages, to satisfy a generous Benevolence which they bear to
their Friends oppressed with Distresses and Calamities. Such Natures one
may <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec248.txt')">call</a> Stores of Providence, which are actuated by a secret Celestial
Influence to undervalue the ordinary Gratifications of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec248.txt')">Wealth</a>, to give
Comfort to an Heart loaded with Affliction, to save a falling Family, to
preserve a Branch of Trade in their Neighbourhood, and give Work to the
Industrious, preserve the Portion of the helpless Infant, and raise the
Head of the mourning Father. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec248.txt')">People</a> whose Hearts are wholly bent towards
Pleasure, or intent upon Gain, never hear of the noble Occurrences among
Men of Industry and Humanity. It would look like a City Romance, to tell
them of the generous Merchant who the other Day sent this Billet to an
eminent Trader under Difficulties to support himself, in whose Fall many
hundreds besides himself had perished; but because I think there is more
Spirit and true Gallantry in it than in any Letter I have ever read from
_Strepkon_ to _Phillis_, I shall insert it even in the mercantile honest
Stile in which it was sent.</p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>I Have heard of the Casualties which have involved you in extreme
Distress at this Time; and knowing you to be a Man of great
Good-Nature, Industry and Probity, have resolved to stand by you. Be
of good Chear, the Bearer brings with him five thousand Pounds, and
has my Order to answer your drawing as much more on my Account. I did
this in Haste, for fear I should come too late for your Relief; but
you may value your self with me to the Sum of fifty thousand Pounds;
for I can very chearfully run the Hazard of being so much less <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec248.txt')">rich</a>
than I am now, to save an honest Man whom I love.</p><p>_Your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec248.txt')">Friend</a> and Servant_,
[W. S. [2]]</p><p>I think there is somewhere in _Montaigne_ Mention made of a Family-book,
wherein all the Occurrences that happened from one Generation of that
House to another were recorded. Were there such a Method in the
Families, which are concerned in this Generosity, it would be an hard
Task for the greatest in _Europe_ to give, in their own, an Instance of
a Benefit better placed, or conferred with a more graceful Air. It has
been heretofore urged, how barbarous and inhuman is any unjust Step made
to the Disadvantage of a Trader; and by how much such an Act towards him
is detestable, by so much an Act of Kindness towards him is laudable. I
remember to have heard a Bencher of the _Temple_ tell a Story of a
Tradition in their House, where they had formerly a Custom of chusing
Kings for such a Season, and allowing him his Expences at the Charge of
the Society: One of our Kings, said my Friend, carried his Royal
Inclination a little too far, and there was a Committee ordered to look
into the Management of his Treasury. Among other Things it appeared,
that his Majesty walking _incog_, in the Cloister, had overheard a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec248.txt')">poor</a>
Man say to another, Such a small Sum would make me the happiest Man in
the World. The King out of his Royal Compassion privately inquired into
his Character, and finding him a proper Object of Charity, sent him the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec248.txt')">Money</a>. When the Committee read their Report, the House passed his
Account with a Plaudite without further Examination, upon the Recital of
this Article in them.</p><p>_For making a Man happy_    £. : s. : d.:</p><p>10 : 00 : 00</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [an]]</p><p>
