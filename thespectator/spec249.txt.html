<p>No. 249.             Saturday, December 15, 1711.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>[Greek: _Gélôs akairos en brotois deinòn kakòn_]</p><p>Frag. Vet. <a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec249.txt')">Poet</a>.</p><p></p><p>When I make Choice of a Subject that has not been treated on by others,
I throw together my Reflections on it without any Order or Method, so
that they may appear rather in the Looseness and Freedom of an Essay,
than in the Regularity of a Set Discourse. It is after this Manner that
I shall consider <a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec249.txt')">Laughter</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec249.txt')">Ridicule</a> in my present Paper.</p><p>Man is the merriest Species of the Creation, all above and below him are
Serious. He sees things in a different Light from other Beings, and
finds his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec249.txt')">Mirth</a> [a]rising from Objects that perhaps cause something like
Pity or Displeasure in higher Natures. Laughter is indeed a very good
Counterpoise to the Spleen; and it seems but reasonable that we should
be capable of receiving Joy from what is no real Good to us, since we
can receive Grief from what is no real Evil.</p><p>I have in my Forty-seventh Paper raised a Speculation on the Notion of a
Modern Philosopher [1], who describes the first Motive of Laughter to be
a secret Comparison which we make between our selves, and the Persons we
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec249.txt')">laugh</a> at; or, in other <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec249.txt')">Words</a>, that Satisfaction which we receive from
the Opinion of some Pre-eminence in our selves, when we see the
Absurdities of another or when we reflect on any past Absurdities of our
own. This seems to hold in most Cases, and we may observe that the
vainest Part of Mankind are the most addicted to this Passion.</p><p>I have read a Sermon of a Conventual in the Church of _Rome_, on those
Words of the Wise Man, _I said of Laughter, it is mad; and of Mirth,
what does it?_ Upon which he laid it down as a Point of Doctrine, that
Laughter was the Effect of Original Sin, and that _Adam_ could not laugh
before the Fall.</p><p>Laughter, while it lasts, slackens and unbraces the Mind, weakens the
Faculties, and causes a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec249.txt')">kind</a> of Remissness and Dissolution in all the
Powers of the Soul: And thus far it may be looked upon as a Weakness in
the Composition of Human Nature. But if we consider the frequent Reliefs
we receive from it, and how often it breaks the Gloom which is apt to
depress the Mind and damp our Spirits, with transient unexpected Gleams
of Joy, one would take care not to grow too Wise for so great a Pleasure
of Life.</p><p>The Talent of turning Men into Ridicule, and exposing to Laughter those
one converses with, is the Qualification of little ungenerous Tempers. A
young Man with this Cast of Mind cuts himself off from all manner of
Improvement. Every one has his Flaws and Weaknesses; nay, the greatest
Blemishes are often found in the most shining Characters; but what an
absurd Thing is it to pass over all the valuable Parts of a Man, and fix
our Attention on his Infirmities to observe his Imperfections more than
his Virtues; and to make use of him for the Sport of others, rather than
for our own Improvement?</p><p>We therefore very often find, that Persons the most accomplished in
Ridicule are those who are very shrewd at hitting a Blot, without
exerting any thing masterly in themselves. As there are many eminent
Criticks who never writ a good Line, there are many admirable Buffoons
that animadvert upon every single Defect in another, without ever
discovering the least Beauty of their own. By this Means, these unlucky
little Wits often gain Reputation in the Esteem of Vulgar Minds, and
raise themselves above Persons of much more laudable Characters.</p><p>If the Talent of Ridicule were employed to laugh Men out of Vice and
Folly, it might be of some Use to the World; but instead of this, we
find that it is generally made use of to laugh Men out of Virtue and
good Sense, by attacking every thing that is Solemn and Serious, Decent
and Praiseworthy in Human Life.</p><p>We may observe, that in the First Ages of the World, when the great
Souls and Master-pieces of Human Nature were produced, Men shined by a
noble Simplicity of Behaviour, and were Strangers to those little
Embellishments which are so fashionable in our present Conversation. And
it is very remarkable, that notwithstanding we fall short at present of
the Ancients in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec249.txt')">Poetry</a>, Painting, Oratory, History, Architecture, and
all the noble Arts and Sciences which depend more upon <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec249.txt')">Genius</a> than
Experience, we exceed them as much in Doggerel, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec249.txt')">Humour</a>, Burlesque, and
all the trivial Arts of Ridicule. We meet with more Raillery among the
Moderns, but more Good Sense among the Ancients.</p><p>The two great Branches of Ridicule in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec249.txt')">Writing</a> are Comedy and Burlesque.
The first ridicules Persons by drawing them in their proper Characters,
the other by drawing them quite unlike themselves. Burlesque is
therefore of two kinds; the first represents mean Persons in the
Accoutrements of Heroes, the other describes great Persons acting and
speaking like the basest among the People. _Don Quixote_ is an Instance
of the first, and _Lucians_ Gods of the second. It is a Dispute among
the Criticks, whether Burlesque Poetry runs best in Heroick <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec249.txt')">Verse</a>, like
that of the _Dispensary;_ [2] or in Doggerel, like that of _Hudibras_. I
think where the low Character is to be raised, the Heroick is the proper
Measure; but when an Hero is to be pulled down and degraded, it is done
best in Doggerel.</p><p>If _Hudibras_ had been set out with as much <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec249.txt')">Wit</a> and Humour in Heroick
Verse as he is in Doggerel, he would have made a much more agreeable
Figure than he does; though the generality of his Readers are so
wonderfully pleased with the double Rhimes, that I do not expect many
will be of my Opinion in this Particular.</p><p>I shall conclude this Essay upon Laughter with observing that the
Metaphor of Laughing, applied to <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec249.txt')">Fields</a> and Meadows when they are in
Flower, or to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec249.txt')">Trees</a> when they are in Blossom, runs through all
Languages; which I have not observed of any other Metaphor, excepting
that of Fire and Burning when they are applied to Love. This shews that
we naturally regard Laughter, as what is in it self both amiable and
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec249.txt')">beautiful</a>. For this Reason likewise _Venus_ has gained the Title of
[Greek: Philomeídaes,] the Laughter-loving Dame, as _Waller_ has
Translated it, and is represented by _Horace_ as the Goddess who
delights in Laughter. _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec249.txt')">Milton</a>_, in a joyous Assembly of imaginary
Persons [3], has given us a very Poetical Figure of Laughter. His whole
Band of Mirth is so finely described, that I shall [set [4]] down [the
Passage] at length.</p><p>_But come thou Goddess fair and free,
In Heaven ycleped_ Euphrosyne,
_And by Men, heart-easing Mirth,
Whom lovely_ Venus _at a Birth,
With two Sister Graces more,
To Ivy-crowned_ Bacchus _bore:
Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec249.txt')">Jest</a> and youthful jollity,
Quips and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,
Nods, and Becks, and wreathed Smiles,
Such as hang on_ Hebes _Cheek,
And love to live in Dimple sleek:
Sport that wrinkled Care derides,_
And Laughter holding both his Sides.
_Come, and trip it, as you go,
On the light fantastick Toe:
And in thy right Hand lead with thee
The Mountain Nymph, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec249.txt')">sweet</a> Liberty;
And if I give thee Honour due,
Mirth, admit me of thy Crew,
To live with her, and live with thee,
In unreproved Pleasures free_.</p><p>

of _the Dispensary_.</p><p>The piercing Caustics ply their spiteful Powr;
Emetics ranch, and been Cathartics sour.

And Pestles peal a martial Symphony_.]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 3: L'Allegro.]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 4: [set it]]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
