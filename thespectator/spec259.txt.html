<p>No. 259.             Thursday, December 27, 1711.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>Quod decet honestum est, et quod honestum est decet.</p><p>Tull.</p><p></p><p>There are some <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec259.txt')">Things</a> which cannot come under certain Rules, but which
one would think could not need them. Of this kind are outward Civilities
and Salutations. These one would imagine might be regulated by every
Man's Common Sense without the Help of an Instructor; but that which we
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec259.txt')">call</a> Common Sense suffers under that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec259.txt')">Word</a>; for it sometimes implies no
more than that Faculty which is common to all Men, but sometimes
signifies right Reason, and what all Men should consent to. In this
latter Acceptation of the Phrase, it is no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec259.txt')">great</a> Wonder <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec259.txt')">People</a> err so
much against it, since it is not every one who is possessed of it, and
there are fewer, who against common Rules and Fashions, dare obey its
Dictates. As to Salutations, which I was about to talk of, I observe as
I strole about Town, there are great Enormities committed with regard to
this Particular. You shall sometimes see a Man begin the Offer of a
Salutation, and observe a forbidding Air, or escaping Eye, in the Person
he is going to salute, and stop short in the Pole of his Neck. This in
the Person who believed he could do it with a good Grace, and was
refused the Opportunity, is justly resented with a Coldness the whole
ensuing Season. Your great Beauties, People in much Favour, or by any
Means or for any Purpose overflattered, are apt to practise this which
one may call the preventing Aspect, and throw their Attention another
Way, lest they should confer a Bow or a Curtsie upon a Person who might
not appear to deserve that Dignity. Others you shall find so obsequious,
and so very courteous, as there is no escaping their Favours of this
Kind. Of this Sort may be a Man who is in the fifth or sixth Degree of
Favour with a Minister; this good Creature is resolved to shew the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec259.txt')">World</a>, that great Honours cannot at all change his Manners; he is the
same civil Person he ever was; he will venture his Neck to bow out of a
Coach in full Speed, at once, to shew he is full of Business, and yet is
not so taken up as to forget his old <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec259.txt')">Friend</a>. With a Man, who is not so
well formed for Courtship and elegant <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec259.txt')">Behaviour</a>, such a Gentleman as
this seldom finds his Account in the Return of his Compliments, but he
will still go on, for he is in his own Way, and must not omit; let the
Neglect fall on your Side, or where it will, his Business is still to be
well-bred to the End. I think I have read, in one of our _English_
Comedies, a Description of a Fellow that affected knowing every Body,
and for Want of Judgment in Time and Place, would bow and smile in the
Face of a Judge sitting in the Court, would sit in an opposite Gallery
and smile in the Ministers Face as he came up into the Pulpit, and nod
as if he alluded to some Familiarities between them in another Place.
But now I happen to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec259.txt')">speak</a> of Salutation at <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec259.txt')">Church</a>, I must take notice
that several of my Correspondents have importuned me to consider that
Subject, and settle the Point of Decorum in that Particular.</p><p>I do not pretend to be the best Courtier in the World, but I have often
on publick Occasions thought it a very great Absurdity in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec259.txt')">Company</a>
(during the Royal Presence) to exchange Salutations from all Parts of
the Room, when certainly Common Sense should suggest, that all Regards
at that Time should be engaged, and cannot be diverted to any other
Object, without Disrespect to the Sovereign. But as to the Complaint of
my Correspondents, it is not to be imagined what Offence some of them
take at the Custom of Saluting in Places of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec259.txt')">Worship</a>. I have a very angry
Letter from a Lady, who tells me [of] one of her Acquaintance, [who,]
out of meer Pride and a Pretence to be rude, takes upon her to return no
Civilities done to her in Time of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec259.txt')">Divine</a> Service, and is the most
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec259.txt')">religious</a> Woman for no other Reason but to appear a Woman of the best
Quality in the Church. This absurd Custom had better be abolished than
retained, if it were but to prevent Evils of no higher a Nature than
this is; but I am informed of Objections much more considerable: A
Dissenter of Rank and Distinction was lately prevailed upon by a Friend
of his to come to one of the greatest Congregations of the Church of
_England_ about Town: After the Service was over, he declared he was
very well satisfied with the little Ceremony which was used towards <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec259.txt')">God</a>
Almighty; but at the same time he feared he should not be able to go
through those required towards one another: As to this Point he was in a
State of Despair, and feared he was not well-bred enough to be a
Convert. There have been many Scandals of this Kind given to our
Protestant Dissenters from the outward Pomp and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec259.txt')">Respect</a> we take to our
selves in our Religious Assemblies. A Quaker who came one Day into a
Church, fixed his Eyes upon an old Lady with a Carpet larger than that
from the Pulpit before her, expecting when she would hold forth. An
Anabaptist who designs to come over himself, and all his Family, within
few Months, is sensible they want Breeding enough for our Congregations,
and has sent his two [eldest [1]] Daughters to learn to dance, that they
may not misbehave themselves at Church: It is worth considering whether,
in regard to awkward People with scrupulous Consciences, a good
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec259.txt')">Christian</a> of the best Air in the World ought not rather to deny herself
the Opportunity of shewing so many Graces, than keep a bashful Proselyte
without the Pale of the Church.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [elder]]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
