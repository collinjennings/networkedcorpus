<p>No. 265.               Thursday, January 3, 1712.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>Dixerit e multis aliquis, quid virus in angues
Adjicis? et rabidæ tradis ovile lupæ?</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>One of the Fathers, if I am rightly informed, has defined a <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec265.txt')">Woman</a> to be
[Greek: xôon philokôsmon], _an Animal that delights in Finery_. I have
already treated of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec265.txt')">Sex</a> in two or three Papers, conformably to this
Definition, and have in particular observed, that in all Ages they have
been more careful then the Men to adorn that Part of the <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec265.txt')">Head</a>, which we
generally <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec265.txt')">call</a> the Outside.</p><p>This Observation is so very notorious, that when in ordinary Discourse
we say a Man has a fine Head, a long Head, or a good Head, we express
ourselves metaphorically, and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec265.txt')">speak</a> in relation to his Understanding;
whereas when we say of a Woman, she has a fine, a long or a good Head,
we speak only in relation to her Commode.</p><p>It is observed among Birds, that Nature has lavished all her Ornaments
upon the Male, who very often appears in a most beautiful Head-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec265.txt')">dress</a>:
Whether it be a Crest, a Comb, a Tuft of Feathers, or a natural little
Plume, erected like a kind of Pinacle on the very Top of the Head. [As
Nature on the contrary [1] has poured out her Charms in the greatest
Abundance upon the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec265.txt')">Female</a> Part of our Species, so they are very
assiduous in bestowing upon themselves the finest Garnitures of Art. The
Peacock in all his Pride, does not display half the Colours that appear
in the Garments of a _British_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec265.txt')">Lady</a>, when she is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec265.txt')">dressed</a> either for a
Ball or a Birth-day.</p><p>But to return to our Female <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec265.txt')">Heads</a>. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec265.txt')">Ladies</a> have been for some time in
a kind of _moulting Season_, with regard to that Part of their Dress,
having cast great Quantities of Ribbon, Lace, and Cambrick, and in some
measure reduced that Part of the human Figure to the beautiful globular
Form, which is natural to it. We have for a great while expected what
kind of Ornament would be substituted in the Place of those antiquated
Commodes. But our Female Projectors were all the last Summer so taken up
with the Improvement of their Petticoats, that they had not time to
attend to any thing else; but having at length sufficiently adorned
their lower Parts, they now begin to turn their Thoughts upon the other
Extremity, as well remembring the old Kitchen Proverb, that if you light
your Fire at both Ends, the middle will shift for it self.</p><p>I am engaged in this Speculation by a Sight which I lately met with at
the Opera. As I was standing in the hinder Part of the Box, I took
notice of a little Cluster of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec265.txt')">Women</a> sitting together in the prettiest
coloured Hoods that I ever saw. One of them was Blue, another Yellow,
and another Philomot; [2] the fourth was of a Pink Colour, and the fifth
of a pale Green. I looked with as much Pleasure upon this little
party-coloured Assembly, as upon a Bed of Tulips, and did not know at
first whether it might not be an Embassy of _Indian_ Queens; but upon my
going about into the Pit, and taking them in Front, I was immediately
undeceived, and saw so much <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec265.txt')">Beauty</a> in every Face, that I found them all
to be _English_. Such Eyes and Lips, Cheeks and Foreheads, could be the
Growth of no other Country. The Complection of their Faces hindred me
from observing any farther the Colour of their Hoods, though I could
easily perceive by that unspeakable Satisfaction which appeared in their
Looks, that their own Thoughts were wholly taken up on those <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec265.txt')">pretty</a>
Ornaments they wore upon their Heads.</p><p>I am informed that this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec265.txt')">Fashion</a> spreads daily, insomuch that the Whig
and Tory Ladies begin already to hang out different Colours, and to shew
their Principles in their Head-dress. Nay if I may believe my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec265.txt')">Friend</a>
WILL. HONEYCOMB, there is a certain old Coquet of his Acquaintance who
intends to appear very suddenly in a Rainbow Hood, like the _Iris_ in
_Dryden's Virgil_, not questioning but that among such a variety of
Colours she shall have a Charm for every Heart.</p><p>My Friend WILL., who very much values himself upon his great Insights
into Gallantry, tells me, that he can already guess at the Humour a Lady
is in by her Hood, as the Courtiers of _Morocco_ know the Disposition of
their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec265.txt')">present</a> Emperor by the Colour of the Dress which he puts on. When
_Melesinda_ wraps her Head in Flame Colour, her Heart is set upon
Execution. When she covers it with Purple, I would not, says he, advise
her Lover to approach her; but if she appears in White, it is Peace, and
he may hand her out of her Box with Safety.</p><p>Will, informs me likewise, that these Hoods may be used as Signals. Why
else, says he, does _Cornelia_ always put on a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec265.txt')">Black</a> Hood when her
Husband is gone into the Country?</p><p>Such are my Friend HONEYCOMBS Dreams of Gallantry. For my own part, I
impute this Diversity of Colours in the Hoods to the Diversity of
Complexion in the Faces of my pretty Country Women. _Ovid_ in his Art of
Love has given some Precepts as to this Particular, though I find they
are different from those which prevail among the Moderns. He recommends
a Red striped Silk to the pale Complexion; White to the Brown, and Dark
to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec265.txt')">Fair</a>. On the contrary my Friend WILL., who pretends to be a
greater Master in this Art than _Ovid_, tells me, that the palest
Features look the most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec265.txt')">agreeable</a> in white Sarsenet; that a Face which is
overflushed appears to advantage in the deepest Scarlet, and that the
darkest Complexion is not a little alleviated by a Black Hood. In short,
he is for losing the Colour of the Face in that of the Hood, as a Fire
burns dimly, and a Candle goes half out, in the Light of the Sun. This,
says he, your _Ovid_ himself has hinted, where he treats of these
Matters, when he tells us that the blue Water Nymphs are dressed in Sky
coloured Garments; and that _Aurora_, who always appears in the Light of
the Rising Sun, is robed in Saffron.</p><p>Whether these his Observations are justly grounded I cannot tell: but I
have often known him, as we have stood together behind the Ladies,
praise or dispraise the Complexion of a Face which he never saw, from
observing the Colour of her Hood, and has been very seldom out in these
his Guesses.</p><p>As I have Nothing more at Heart than the Honour and Improvement of the
Fair Sex, [3] I cannot conclude this Paper without an Exhortation to the
_British_ Ladies, that they would excel the Women of all other Nations
as much in Virtue and good Sense, as they do in Beauty; which they may
certainly do, if they will be as industrious to cultivate their Minds,
as they are to adorn their Bodies: In the mean while I shall recommend
to their most serious Consideration the Saying of an old _Greek_ Poet,</p><p>[Greek: Gynaikì kósmos ho trópos, k ou chrysía.]</p><p>
