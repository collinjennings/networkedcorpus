<p>No. 266.               Friday, January 4, 1712.                  Steele.</p><p></p><p>Id vero est, quod ego mihi puto palmarium,
Me reperisse, quomodo adolescentulus
Meretricum ingenia et mores possit noscere:
Mature ut cum cogn√≥rit perpetuo oderit.</p><p>Ter. Eun. Act. 5, Sc. 4.</p><p></p><p>No Vice or Wickedness which <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec266.txt')">People</a> fall into from Indulgence to
Desire[s] which are natural to all, ought to place them below the
Compassion of the virtuous Part of the World; which indeed often makes
me a little apt to suspect the Sincerity of their Virtue, who are too
warmly provoked at other Peoples personal Sins. The unlawful Commerce of
the Sexes is of all other the hardest to avoid; and yet there is no one
which you shall hear the rigider Part of Womankind <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec266.txt')">speak</a> of with so
little Mercy. It is very certain that a modest <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec266.txt')">Woman</a> cannot abhor the
Breach of Chastity too much; but pray let her hate it for her self, and
only pity it in others. WILL. HONEYCOMB calls these over-offended
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec266.txt')">Ladies</a>, the Outragiously Virtuous.</p><p>I do not design to fall upon Failures in general, with relation to the
Gift of Chastity, but at present only enter upon that large Field, and
begin with the Consideration of <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec266.txt')">poor</a> and publick Whores. The other
Evening passing along near _Covent-Garden_, I was jogged on the Elbow as
I turned into the Piazza, on the right Hand coming out of
_James-street_, by a slim <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec266.txt')">young</a> Girl of about Seventeen, who with a pert
Air asked me if I was for a Pint of Wine. I do not know but I should
have indulged my Curiosity in having some Chat with her, but that I am
informed the Man of the _Bumper_ knows me; and it would have made a
Story for him not very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec266.txt')">agreeable</a> to some Part of my Writings, though I
have in others so frequently said that I am wholly unconcerned in any
Scene I am in, but meerly as a Spectator. This Impediment being in my
Way, we stood [under [1]] one of the Arches by Twilight; and there I
could observe as exact Features as I had ever seen, the most agreeable
Shape, the finest Neck and Bosom, in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec266.txt')">Word</a>, the whole Person of a Woman
exquisitely Beautiful. She affected to allure me with a forced
Wantonness in her Look and Air; but I saw it checked with Hunger and
Cold: Her Eyes were wan and eager, her Dress thin and tawdry, her Mein
genteel and childish. This strange Figure gave me much Anguish of Heart,
and to avoid being seen with her I went away, but could not forbear
giving her a Crown. The poor thing sighed, curtisied, and with a
Blessing, expressed with the utmost Vehemence, turned from me. This
Creature is what they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec266.txt')">call</a> _newly come upon the Town_, but who, I
suppose, falling into cruel <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec266.txt')">Hands</a> was left in the first Month from her
Dishonour, and exposed to pass through the Hands and Discipline of one
of those Hags of Hell whom we call Bawds. But lest I should grow too
suddenly grave on this Subject, and be my self outragiously good, I
shall turn to a Scene in one of _Fletchers_ Plays, where this Character
is drawn, and the Oeconomy of Whoredom most admirably described. The
Passage I would point to is in the third Scene of the second Act of _The
Humorous Lieutenant. Leucippe_ who is Agent for the Kings Lust, and
bawds at the same time for the whole Court, is very pleasantly
introduced, reading her Minutes as a Person of Business, with two Maids,
her Under-Secretaries, taking Instructions at a Table before her. Her
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec266.txt')">Women</a>, both those under her present Tutelage, and those which she is
laying wait for, are alphabetically set down in her Book; and as she is
looking over the Letter _C_, in a muttering Voice, as if between
Soliloquy and speaking out, she says,</p><p>_Her Maidenhead will yield me; let me see now;
She is not Fifteen they say: For her Complexion_---
<a name="topic26" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('26', 'spec266.txt')">Cloe</a>, Cloe, Cloe, _here I have her_,
Cloe,_ the Daughter of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec266.txt')">Country</a> Gentleman;
Here Age upon Fifteen. Now her Complexion,
A lovely brown; here tis; Eyes black and rolling,
The Body neatly built; she strikes a Lute well,
Sings most enticingly: These Helps consider'd,
Her Maidenhead will amount to some three <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec266.txt')">hundred</a>,
Or three hundred and fifty Crowns, twill bear it handsomly.
Her Fathers poor, some little Share deducted,
To buy him a Hunting Nag_--</p><p>These Creatures are very well instructed in the Circumstances and
Manners of all who are any Way related to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec266.txt')">Fair</a> One whom they have a
Design upon. As _Cloe_ is to be purchased with [350] [2] Crowns, and the
Father taken off with a Pad; the Merchants Wife next to her, who
abounds in Plenty, is not to have downright <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec266.txt')">Money</a>, but the mercenary
Part of her Mind is engaged with a Present of Plate and a little
Ambition. She is made to understand that it is a Man of Quality who dies
for her. The Examination of a young Girl for Business, and the crying
down her Value for being a slight Thing, together with every other
Circumstance in the Scene, are inimitably excellent, and have the true
Spirit of Comedy; tho it were to be wished the Author had added a
Circumstance which should make _Leucippe's_ Baseness more odious.</p><p>It must not be thought a Digression from my intended Speculation, to
talk of Bawds in a Discourse upon Wenches; for a Woman of the Town is
not thoroughly and properly such, without having gone through the
Education of one of these Houses. But the compassionate Case of very
many is, that they are taken into such Hands without any the least
Suspicion, previous Temptation, or Admonition to what Place they are
going. The last Week I went to an Inn in the City to enquire for some
Provisions which were sent by a Waggon out of the Country; and as I
waited in one of the Boxes till the Chamberlain had looked over his
Parcel, I heard an old and a young Voice repeating the Questions and
Responses of the Church- Catechism. I thought it no Breach of good
Manners to peep at a Crevice, and look in at People so well employed;
but who should I see there but the most artful Procuress in the Town,
examining a most beautiful Country-Girl, who had come up in the same
Waggon with my Things, _Whether she was well educated, could forbear
playing the Wanton with Servants, and idle fellows, of which this Town_,
says she, _is too full_: At the same time, _Whether she knew enough of
Breeding, as that if a Squire or a Gentleman, or one that was her
Betters, should give her a civil Salute, she should curtsy and be
humble, nevertheless._ Her innocent _forsooths, yess, and't please
yous, and she would do her Endeavour_, moved the good old <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec266.txt')">Lady</a> to take
her out of the Hands of a Country Bumpkin her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('26', 'spec266.txt')">Brother</a>, and hire her for
her own Maid. I staid till I saw them all marched out to take Coach; the
brother loaded with a great Cheese, he prevailed upon her to take for
her Civilities to [his] Sister. This poor Creatures Fate is not far off
that of hers whom I spoke of above, and it is not to be doubted, but
after she has been long enough a Prey to Lust she will be delivered over
to Famine; the Ironical Commendation of the Industry and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec266.txt')">Charity</a> of
these antiquated Ladies[, these] [3] Directors of Sin, after they can no
longer commit it, makes up the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec266.txt')">Beauty</a> of the inimitable Dedication to
the _Plain-Dealer_, [4] and is a Masterpiece of Raillery on this Vice.
But to understand all the Purleues of this Game the better, and to
illustrate this Subject in future Discourses, I must venture my self,
with my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec266.txt')">Friend</a> WILL, into the Haunts of Beauty and Gallantry; from
pampered Vice in the Habitations of the Wealthy, to distressed indigent
Wickedness expelled the Harbours of the Brothel.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [under in]]</p><p>
