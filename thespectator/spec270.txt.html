<p>No. 270.                Wednesday, January 9, 1712.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>Discit enim citius, meminitque libentius illud,
Quod quis deridet, quam quod probat.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I do not know that I have been in greater Delight for these many Years,
than in beholding the Boxes at the <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec270.txt')">Play</a> the last Time _The Scornful
<a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec270.txt')">Lady</a>_ [1] was acted. So <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec270.txt')">great</a> an Assembly of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec270.txt')">Ladies</a> placed in gradual
Rows in all the Ornaments of Jewels, Silk and Colours, gave so lively
and gay an Impression to the Heart, that methought the Season of the
Year was vanished; and I did not think it an ill Expression of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec270.txt')">young</a>
Fellow who stood near me, that called the Boxes Those Beds of Tulips. It
was a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec270.txt')">pretty</a> Variation of the Prospect, when any one of these fine
Ladies rose up and did <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec270.txt')">Honour</a> to herself and <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec270.txt')">Friend</a> at a Distance, by
curtisying; and gave Opportunity to that Friend to shew her Charms to
the same Advantage in returning the Salutation. Here that Action is as
proper and graceful, as it is at Church unbecoming and impertinent. By
the way, I must take the Liberty to observe that I did not see any one
who is usually so full of Civilities at Church, offer at any such
Indecorum during any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec270.txt')">Part</a> of the Action of the Play.</p><p>Such beautiful Prospects gladden our Minds, and when considered in
general, give innocent and pleasing Ideas. He that dwells upon any one
Object of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec270.txt')">Beauty</a>, may fix his Imagination to his Disquiet; but the
Contemplation of a whole Assembly together, is a Defence against the
Encroachment of Desire: At least to me, who have taken pains to look at
Beauty abstracted from the Consideration of its being the Object of
Desire; at Power, only as it sits upon another, without any Hopes of
partaking any Share of it; at Wisdom and Capacity, without any
Pretensions to rival or envy its Acquisitions: I say to me, who am
really free from forming any Hopes by beholding the Persons of beautiful
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec270.txt')">Women</a>, or warming my self into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec270.txt')">Ambition</a> from the Successes of other Men,
this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec270.txt')">World</a> is not only a meer Scene, but a very pleasant one. Did
Mankind but know the Freedom which there is in keeping thus aloof from
the World, I should have more Imitators, than the powerfullest Man in
the Nation has Followers. To be no Man's Rival in Love, or Competitor in
Business, is a Character which if it does not recommend you as it ought
to Benevolence among those whom you live with, yet has it certainly this
Effect, that you do not stand so much in need of their Approbation, as
you would if you aimed at it more, in setting your Heart on the same
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec270.txt')">things</a> which the Generality doat on. By this means, and with this easy
Philosophy, I am never less at a Play than when I am at the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec270.txt')">Theatre</a>; but
indeed I am seldom so well pleased with the Action as in that Place, for
most Men follow Nature no longer than while they are in their
Night-Gowns, and all the busy Part of the Day are in Characters which
they neither become or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec270.txt')">act</a> in with Pleasure to themselves or their
Beholders. But to return to my Ladies: I was very well pleased to see so
great a Crowd of them assembled at a Play, wherein the Heroine, as the
Phrase is, is so just a Picture of the Vanity of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec270.txt')">Sex</a> in tormenting
their Admirers. The Lady who pines for the Man whom she treats with so
much Impertinence and Inconstancy, is drawn with much Art and Humour.
Her Resolutions to be extremely civil, but her Vanity arising just at
the Instant that she resolved to express her self kindly, are described
as by one who had studied the Sex. But when my Admiration is fixed upon
this excellent Character, and two or three others in the Play, I must
confess I was moved with the utmost Indignation at the trivial,
senseless, and unnatural Representation of the Chaplain. It is possible
there may be a Pedant in Holy Orders, and we have seen one or two of
them in the World; but such a Driveler as Sir _Roger_, so bereft of all
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec270.txt')">manner</a> of Pride, which is the Characteristick of a Pedant, is what one
would not believe could come into the Head of the same Man who drew the
rest of the Play. The Meeting between _Welford_ and him shews a Wretch
without any Notion of the Dignity of his Function; and it is out of all
common Sense that he should give an Account of himself _as one sent four
or five Miles in a Morning on Foot for Eggs._ It is not to be denied,
but his Part and that of the Maid whom he makes Love to, are excellently
well performed; but a Thing which is blameable in it self, grows still
more so by the Success in the Execution of it. It is so mean a Thing to
gratify a loose Age with a scandalous Representation of what is
reputable among Men, not to say what is sacred, that no Beauty, no
Excellence in an Author ought to attone for it; nay, such Excellence is
an Aggravation of his Guilt, and an Argument that he errs against the
Conviction of his own Understanding and Conscience. Wit should be tried
by this Rule, and an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec270.txt')">Audience</a> should rise against such a Scene, as
throws down the Reputation of any thing which the Consideration of
Religion or Decency should preserve from Contempt. But all this Evil
arises from this one Corruption of Mind, that makes Men resent Offences
against their Virtue, less than those against their Understanding. An
Author shall write as if he thought there was not one Man of Honour or
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec270.txt')">Woman</a> of Chastity in the House, and come off with Applause: For an
Insult upon all the Ten Commandments, with the little Criticks, is not
so bad as the Breach of an Unity of Time or Place. Half Wits do not
apprehend the Miseries that must necessarily flow from Degeneracy of
Manners; nor do they know that Order is the Support of Society. Sir
_Roger_ and his Mistress are Monsters of the Poets own forming; the
Sentiments in both of them are such as do not arise in Fools of their
Education. We all know that a silly Scholar, instead of being below
every one he meets with, is apt to be exalted above the Rank of such as
are really his Superiors: His Arrogance is always founded upon
particular Notions of Distinction in his own Head, accompanied with a
pedantick Scorn of all Fortune and Preheminence, when compared with his
Knowledge and Learning. This very one Character of Sir _Roger_, as silly
as it really is, has done more towards the Disparagement of Holy Orders,
and consequently of Virtue it self, than all the Wit that Author or any
other could make up for in the Conduct of the longest Life after it. I
do not pretend, in saying this, to give myself Airs of more Virtue than
my Neighbours, but assert it from the Principles by which Mankind must
always be governed. Sallies of Imagination are to be overlooked, when
they are committed out of Warmth in the Recommendation of what is Praise
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec270.txt')">worthy</a>; but a deliberate advancing of Vice, with all the Wit in the
World, is as ill an Action as any that comes before the Magistrate, and
ought to be received as such by the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec270.txt')">People</a>.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Beaumont and Fletchers. Vol. II.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
