<p>No. 276.                Wednesday, January 16, 1712.             Steele.</p><p></p><p>Errori nomen virtus posuisset honestum.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>I hope you have Philosophy enough to be capable of bearing the Mention
of your Faults. Your Papers which regard the fallen Part of the <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec276.txt')">Fair</a>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec276.txt')">Sex</a>, are, I think, written with an Indelicacy, which makes them
unworthy to be inserted in the Writings of a Moralist who knows the
<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec276.txt')">World</a>. I cannot allow that you are at Liberty to observe upon the
Actions of Mankind with the Freedom which you seem to resolve upon; at
least if you do, you should take along with you the Distinction of
Manners of the World, according to the Quality and Way of Life of the
Persons concerned. A Man of Breeding speaks of even Misfortune among
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec276.txt')">Ladies</a> without giving it the most terrible Aspect it can bear: And
this Tenderness towards them, is much more to be preserved when you
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec276.txt')">speak</a> of Vices. All Mankind are so far related, that Care is to be
taken, in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec276.txt')">things</a> to which all are liable, you do not mention what
concerns one in Terms which shall disgust another. Thus to tell a rich
Man of the Indigence of a Kinsman of his, or abruptly inform a
virtuous <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec276.txt')">Woman</a> of the Lapse of one who till then was in the same
degree of Esteem with her self, is in a kind involving each of them in
some Participation of those Disadvantages. It is therefore expected
from every Writer, to treat his Argument in such a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec276.txt')">Manner</a>, as is most
proper to entertain the sort of Readers to whom his Discourse is
directed. It is not necessary when you write to the Tea-table, that
you should draw Vices which carry all the Horror of Shame and
Contempt: If you paint an impertinent Self-love, an artful Glance, an
assumed Complection, you say all which you ought to suppose they can
possibly be guilty of. When you talk with this Limitation, you behave
your self so as that you may expect others in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec276.txt')">Conversation</a> may second
your Raillery; but when you do it in a Stile which every body else
forbears in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec276.txt')">Respect</a> to their Quality, they have an easy Remedy in
forbearing to read you, and hearing no more of their Faults. A Man
that is now and then guilty of an Intemperance is not to be called a
Drunkard; but the Rule of polite Raillery, is to speak of a Man's
Faults as if you loved him. Of this Nature is what was said by
_Cæsar_: When one was railing with an uncourtly Vehemence, and broke
out, What must we <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec276.txt')">call</a> him who was taken in an Intrigue with another
Man's Wife? Cæsar answered very gravely, _A careless Fellow_. This was
at once a Reprimand for speaking of a Crime which in those Days had
not the Abhorrence attending it as it ought, as well as an Intimation
that all intemperate <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec276.txt')">Behaviour</a> before Superiors loses its Aim, by
accusing in a Method unfit for the Audience. A <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec276.txt')">Word</a> to the Wise. All I
mean here to say to you is, That the most free Person of Quality can
go no further than being [a kind [1]] Woman; and you should never say
of a Man of Figure worse, than that he knows the World.</p><p>I am, SIR,
Your most humble Servant,
Francis Courtly.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,
I am a Woman of an unspotted Reputation, and know nothing I have ever
done which should encourage such Insolence; but here was one the other
Day, and he was dressed like a Gentleman too, who took the Liberty to
name the Words Lusty Fellow in my Presence. I doubt not but you will
resent it in Behalf of,</p><p>SIR,
Your Humble Servant,
CELIA.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,
You lately put out a dreadful Paper, wherein you promise a full
Account of the State of criminal Love; and call all the Fair who have
transgressed in that Kind by one very rude Name which I do not care to
repeat: But 1 desire to know of you whether I am or I am not of those?
My Case is as follows. I am kept by an old Batchelour, who took me so
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec276.txt')">young</a>, that I knew not how he came by me: He is a Bencher of one of
the Inns of Court, a very gay healthy old Man; which is a lucky thing
for him, who has been, he tells me, a Scowrer, a Scamperer, a Breaker
of Windows, an Invader of Constables, in the Days of Yore when all
Dominion ended with the Day, and Males and Females met helter skelter,
and the Scowrers drove before them all who pretended to keep up Order
or Rule to the Interruption of Love and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec276.txt')">Honour</a>. This is his way of
Talk, for he is very gay when he visits me; but as his former
Knowledge of the Town has alarmed him into an invincible Jealousy, he
keeps me in a pair of Slippers, neat Bodice, warm Petticoats, and my
own Hair woven in Ringlets, after a Manner, he says, he remembers. I
am not Mistress of one Farthing of Money, but have all Necessaries
provided for me, under the Guard of one who procured for him while he
had any Desires to gratify. I know nothing of a Wench's Life, but the
Reputation of it: I have a natural Voice, and a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec276.txt')">pretty</a> untaught Step
in Dancing. His Manner is to bring an old Fellow who has been his
Servant from his Youth, and is gray-headed: This Man makes on the
Violin a certain Jiggish Noise to which I dance, and when that is over
I sing to him some loose Air, that has more Wantonness than Musick in
it. You must have seen a strange window'd House near _Hide-Park,_
which is so built that no one can look out of any of the Apartments;
my Rooms are after that manner, and I never see Man, Woman, or Child,
but in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec276.txt')">Company</a> with the two Persons above-mentioned. He sends me in
all the Books, Pamphlets, Plays, Operas and Songs that come out; and
his utmost Delight in me as a Woman, is to talk over old Amours in my
Presence, to play with my Neck, say _the Time was_, give me a Kiss,
and bid me be sure to follow the Directions of my Guardian (the
above-mentioned <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec276.txt')">Lady</a>) and I shall never want. The Truth of my Case is,
I suppose, that I was educated for a Purpose he did not know he should
be unfit for when I came to Years. Now, Sir, what I ask of you, as a
Casuist, is to tell me how far in these Circumstances I am innocent,
though submissive; he guilty, though impotent?
_I am,
SIR,
Your constant Reader,_
PUCELLA.</p><p>
_To the Man called the_ SPECTATOR.</p><p>_<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec276.txt')">Friend</a>,_
Forasmuch as at the Birth of thy Labour, thou didst promise upon thy
Word, that letting alone the Vanities that do abound, thou wouldst
only endeavour to strengthen the crooked Morals of this our _Babylon_,
I gave Credit to thy fair Speeches, and admitted one of thy Papers,
every Day save _Sunday_, into my House; for the Edification of my
Daughter _Tabitha_, and to the end that Susannah the Wife of my Bosom
might profit thereby. But alas, my Friend, I find that thou art a
Liar, and that the Truth is not in thee; else why didst thou in a
Paper which thou didst lately put forth, make mention of those vain
Coverings for the Heads of our Females, which thou lovest to liken
unto Tulips, and which are lately sprung up amongst us? Nay why didst
thou make mention of them in such a seeming, as if thou didst approve
the Invention, insomuch that my Daughter _Tabitha_ beginneth to wax
wanton, and to lust after these foolish Vanities? Surely thou dost see
with the Eyes of the Flesh. Verily therefore, unless thou dost
speedily amend and leave off following thine own Imaginations, I will
leave off thee.</p><p>_Thy Friend as hereafter thou dost demean thyself,_
Hezekiah Broadbrim.</p><p>
