<p>No. 277.            Thursday, January 17, 1712.               Budgell.</p><p></p><p>--fas est et ab hoste doceri.</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>I presume I need not inform the Polite Part of my Readers,
that before our Correspondence with _<a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec277.txt')">France</a>_ was unhappily
interrupted by the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec277.txt')">War</a>, our <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec277.txt')">Ladies</a> had all their Fashions from
thence; which the Milliners took care to furnish them with by
means of a Jointed Baby, that came regularly over, once a
Month, habited after the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec277.txt')">manner</a> of the most Eminent Toasts
in _Paris_.</p><p>I am credibly informed, that even in the hottest time of the
War, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec277.txt')">Sex</a> made several Efforts, and raised large Contributions
towards the Importation of this Wooden _Madamoiselle._</p><p>Whether the Vessel they set out was lost or taken, or whether
its Cargo was seized on by the Officers of the Custom-house, as
a piece of Contraband Goods, I have not yet been able to
learn; it is, however, certain their first Attempts were without
Success, to the no small Disappointment of our whole <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec277.txt')">Female</a>
World; but as their Constancy and Application, in a matter of
so great Importance, can never be sufficiently commended, I
am glad to find that in Spight of all Opposition, they have at
length carried their Point, of which I received Advice by the
two following Letters.</p><p>
_Mr._ SPECTATOR,
I am so great a Lover of whatever is _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec277.txt')">French</a>_, that I lately
discarded an humble Admirer, because he neither spoke that Tongue, nor
drank Claret. I have long bewailed, in secret, the Calamities of my
Sex during the War, in all which time we have laboured under the
insupportable Inventions of _English_ Tire-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec277.txt')">Women</a>, who, tho they
sometimes copy indifferently well, can never compose with that _Goút_
they do in _France_.</p><p>I was almost in Despair of ever more seeing a Model from that dear
Country, when last Sunday I over-heard a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec277.txt')">Lady</a>, in the next Pew to me,
whisper another, that at the _Seven Stars_ in _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec277.txt')">King</a>-street
Covent-garden_, there was a _Madamoiselle_ compleatly <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec277.txt')">dressed</a> just
come from _Paris_.</p><p>I was in the utmost Impatience during the remaining part of the
Service, and as soon as ever it was over, having learnt the Millener's
_Addresse_, I went directly to her House in _King-street_, but was
told that the _French_ Lady was at a Person of Quality's in
_Pall-mall_, and would not be back again till very late that Night. I
was therefore obliged to renew my Visit very early this Morning, and
had then a full View of the dear Moppet from <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec277.txt')">Head</a> to Foot.</p><p>You cannot imagine, worthy Sir, how ridiculously I find we have all
been trussed up during the War, and how infinitely the _French_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec277.txt')">Dress</a>
excels ours.</p><p>The Mantua has no Leads in the Sleeves, and I hope we are not lighter
than the _French_ Ladies, so as to want that kind of Ballast; the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec277.txt')">Petticoat</a> has no Whale-bone; but fits with an Air altogether galant
and _degagé_: the _Coiffeure_ is inexpressibly <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec277.txt')">pretty</a>, and in short,
the whole Dress has a thousand Beauties in it, which I would not have
as yet made too publick.</p><p>I thought fit, however, to give this Notice, that you may not be
surprized at my appearing _à la mode de Paris_ on the next
Birth-Night. _I am, SIR,
Your humble Servant,_
Teraminta.</p><p>
Within an Hour after I had read this Letter, I received another from the
Owner of the Puppet.</p><p>SIR,
On Saturday last, being the 12th Instant, there arrived at my House
in _King-street, Covent-Garden_, a _French_ Baby for the Year 1712. I
have taken the utmost Care to have her dressed by the most celebrated
Tyre-women and Mantua-makers in _Paris_, and do not find that I have
any Reason to be sorry for the Expence I have been at in her Cloaths
and Importation: However, as I know no Person who is so good a Judge
of Dress as your self, if you please to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec277.txt')">call</a> at my House in your Way
to the City, and take a View of her, I promise to amend whatever you
shall disapprove in your next Paper, before I exhibit her as a Pattern
to the Publick.
_I am, SIR,
Your most humble Admirer,
and most obedient Servant,_
Betty Cross-stitch.</p><p>
As I am willing to do any thing in reason for the Service of my
Country-women, and had much rather prevent Faults than find them, I went
last Night to the House of the above-mentioned Mrs. _Cross-stitch_. As
soon as I enter'd, the Maid of the Shop, who, I suppose, was prepared
for my coming, without asking me any Questions, introduced me to the
little Damsel, and ran away to call her Mistress.</p><p>The Puppet was dressed in a Cherry-coloured Gown and Petticoat, with a
short working Apron over it, which discovered her Shape to the most
Advantage. Her Hair was cut and divided very prettily, with several
Ribbons stuck up and down in it. The Millener assured me, that her
Complexion was such as was worn by all the Ladies of the best <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec277.txt')">Fashion</a> in
_Paris_. Her Head was extreamly high, on which Subject having long since
declared my Sentiments, I shall say nothing more to it at <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec277.txt')">present</a>. I was
also offended at a small Patch she wore on her Breast, which I cannot
suppose is placed there with any good Design.</p><p>Her Necklace was of an immoderate Length, being tied before in such a
manner that the two Ends hung down to her Girdle; but whether these
supply the Place of Kissing-Strings in our Enemy's Country, and whether
our _British_ Ladies have any occasion for them, I shall leave to their
serious Consideration.</p><p>After having observed the Particulars of her Dress, as I was taking a
view of it altogether, the Shop-maid, who is a pert Wench, told me that
_Mademoiselle_ had something very Curious in the tying of her Garters;
but as I pay a due Respect even to a pair of Sticks when they are in
Petticoats, I did not examine into that Particular.</p><p>Upon the whole I was well enough pleased with the Appearance of this gay
Lady, and the more so because she was not Talkative, a Quality very
rarely to be met with in the rest of her Countrywomen.</p><p>As I was taking my leave, the Millener farther informed me, that with
the Assistance of a Watchmaker, who was her Neighbour, and the ingenious
Mr. _Powell_, she had also contrived another Puppet, which by the help
of several little Springs to be wound up within it, could move all its
Limbs, and that she had sent it over to her Correspondent in _Paris_ to
be taught the various Leanings and Bendings of the Head, the Risings of
the Bosom, the Curtesy and Recovery, the genteel Trip, and the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec277.txt')">agreeable</a>
Jet, as they are now practised in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec277.txt')">Court</a> of _France_.</p><p>She added that she hoped she might depend upon having my Encouragement
as soon as it arrived; but as this was a Petition of too great
Importance to be answered _extempore_, I left her without a Reply, and
made the best of my way to WILL. HONEYCOMBS Lodgings, without whose
Advice I never communicate any thing to the Publick of this Nature.</p><p>X.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
