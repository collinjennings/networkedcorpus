<p>No. 278.               Friday, January 18, 1712.                Steele.</p><p>
Sermones ego mallem
Repentes per humum.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,
_SIR_,</p><p>Your having done considerable Service in this great City, by
rectifying the Disorders of Families, and several Wives having
preferred your Advice and Directions to those of their <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec278.txt')">Husbands</a>,
emboldens me to apply to you at this Time. I am a Shop-keeper, and tho
but a young Man, I find by Experience that nothing but the utmost
Diligence both of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec278.txt')">Husband</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec278.txt')">Wife</a> (among trading <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec278.txt')">People</a>) can keep
Affairs in any tolerable Order. My Wife at the Beginning of our
Establishment shewed her self very assisting to me in my Business as
much as could lie in her Way, and I have Reason to believe twas with
her Inclination; but of late she has got acquainted with a Schoolman,
who values himself for his great Knowledge in the _Greek_ Tongue. He
entertains her frequently in the Shop with Discourses of the Beauties
and Excellencies of that <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec278.txt')">Language</a>; and repeats to her several Passages
out of the _Greek_ Poets, wherein he tells her there is unspeakable
Harmony and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec278.txt')">agreeable</a> Sounds that all other Languages are wholly
unacquainted with. He has so infatuated her with his Jargon, that
instead of using her former Diligence in the Shop, she now neglects
the Affairs of the <a name="topic47" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec278.txt')">House</a>, and is wholly taken up with her Tutor in
learning by Heart Scraps of _Greek_, which she vents upon all
Occasions. She told me some Days ago, that whereas I use some _Latin_
Inscriptions in my Shop, she advised me with a great deal of Concern
to have them changed into _Greek;_ it being a Language less
understood, would be more conformable to the Mystery of my Profession;
that our good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec278.txt')">Friend</a> would be assisting to us in this Work; and that a
certain Faculty of Gentlemen would find themselves so much obliged to
me, that they would infallibly make my Fortune: In short her frequent
Importunities upon this and other Impertinences of the like Nature
make me very uneasy; and if your Remonstrances have no more Effect
upon her than mine, I am afraid I shall be obliged to ruin my self to
procure her a Settlement at _Oxford_ with her Tutor, for she's already
too mad for _Bedlam_. Now, Sir, you see the Danger my Family is
exposed to, and the Likelihood of my Wife's becoming both troublesome
and useless, unless her reading her self in your Paper may make her
reflect. She is so very learned that I cannot pretend by <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec278.txt')">Word</a> of Mouth
to argue with her. She laughed out at your ending a Paper in _Greek_,
and said twas a Hint to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec278.txt')">Women</a> of Literature, and very civil not to
translate it to expose them to the Vulgar. You see how it is with,</p><p>_SIR_,
_Your humble Servant_.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,
If you have that Humanity and Compassion in your Nature that you take
such Pains to make one think you have, you will not deny your Advice
to a distressed Damsel, who intends to be determined by your Judgment
in a Matter of great Importance to her. You must know then, There is
an agreeable young Fellow, to whose Person, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec278.txt')">Wit</a>, and Humour no body
makes any Objection, that pretends to have been long in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec278.txt')">Love</a> with me.
To this I must add, (whether it proceeds from the Vanity of my Nature,
or the seeming Sincerity of my Lover, I wont pretend to say) that I
verily believe he has a real Value for me; which if true, you'll allow
may justly augment his Merit for his Mistress. In short, I am so
sensible of his good Qualities, and what I owe to his Passion, that I
think I could sooner resolve to give up my Liberty to him than any
body else, were there not an Objection to be made to his Fortunes, in
regard they don't answer the utmost mine may expect, and are not
sufficient to secure me from undergoing the reproachful Phrase so
commonly used, That she has played the Fool. Now, tho I am one of
those few who heartily despise Equipage, Diamonds, and a Coxcomb, yet
since such opposite Notions from mine prevail in the World, even
amongst the best, and such as are esteemed the most prudent People, I
cant find in my Heart to resolve upon incurring the Censure of those
wise Folks, which I am conscious I shall do, if when I enter into a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec278.txt')">married</a> State, I discover a Thought beyond that of equalling, if not
advancing my Fortunes. Under this Difficulty I now labour, not being
in the least determined whether I shall be governed by the vain World,
and the frequent Examples I meet with, or hearken to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec278.txt')">Voice</a> of my
Lover, and the Motions I find in my Heart in favour of him. Sir, Your
Opinion and Advice in this Affair, is the only thing I know can turn
the Ballance; and which I earnestly intreat I may receive soon; for
till I have your Thoughts upon it, I am engaged not to give my Swain a
final Discharge.</p><p>Besides the particular Obligation you will lay on me, by giving this
Subject Room in one of your Papers, tis possible it may be of use to
some others of my Sex, who will be as grateful for the Favour as,
_SIR,
Your Humble Servant,_
Florinda.</p><p>P. S. _To tell you the Truth I am Married to Him already, but pray say
something to justify me._</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,
You will forgive Us Professors of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec278.txt')">Musick</a> if We make a second
Application to You, in order to promote our Design of exhibiting
Entertainments of Musick in _York-Buildings._ It is industriously
insinuated that Our Intention is to destroy Operas in General, but we
beg of you to insert this plain Explanation of our selves in your
Paper. Our Purpose is only to improve our Circumstances, by improving
the Art which we profess. We see it utterly destroyed at present; and
as we were the Persons who introduced Operas, we think it a groundless
Imputation that we should set up against the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec278.txt')">Opera</a> in it self. What we
pretend to assert is, That the Songs of different <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec278.txt')">Authors</a>
injudiciously put together, and a Foreign Tone and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec278.txt')">Manner</a> which are
expected in every thing now performed among us, has put Musick it self
to a stand; insomuch that the Ears of the People cannot now be
entertained with any thing but what has an impertinent Gayety, without
any just Spirit, or a Languishment of Notes, without any Passion or
common Sense. We hope those Persons of Sense and Quality who have done
us the Honour to subscribe, will not be ashamed of their Patronage
towards us, and not receive Impressions that patronising us is being
for or against the Opera, but truly promoting their own Diversions in
a more just and elegant Manner than has been hitherto performed. _We
are, SIR,
Your most humble Servants,_
Thomas Clayton.
Nicolino Haym.
Charles Dieupart. [1]</p><p>
_There will be no Performances in_ York-buildings _till after that
of the Subscription._</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: See No. 258.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
