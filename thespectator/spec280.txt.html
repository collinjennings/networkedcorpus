The Desire of Pleasing makes a Man <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec280.txt')">agreeable</a> or unwelcome to those with
whom he converses, according to the Motive from which that Inclination
appears to flow. If your Concern for pleasing others arises from innate
Benevolence, it never fails of Success; if from a Vanity to excel, its
Disappointment is no less certain. What we <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec280.txt')">call</a> an agreeable Man, is he
who is endowed with [the [1]] natural Bent to do acceptable <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec280.txt')">things</a> from
a Delight he takes in them meerly as such; and the Affectation of that
Character is what constitutes a Fop. Under these Leaders one may draw up
all those who make any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec280.txt')">Manner</a> of Figure, except in dumb Show. A rational
and select <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec280.txt')">Conversation</a> is composed of Persons, who have the Talent of
Pleasing with Delicacy of Sentiments flowing from habitual Chastity of
Thought; but mixed <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec280.txt')">Company</a> is frequently made up of Pretenders to Mirth,
and is usually pestered with constrained, obscene, and painful
Witticisms. Now and then you meet with a Man so exactly formed for
Pleasing, that it is no matter what he is doing or saying, that is to
say, that there need no Manner of Importance in it, to make him gain
upon every Body who hears or beholds him. This Felicity is not the Gift
of Nature only, but must be attended with happy Circumstances, which add
a Dignity to the familiar <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec280.txt')">Behaviour</a> which distinguishes him whom we call
an agreeable Man. It is from this that every Body loves and esteems
_Polycarpus_. He is in the Vigour of his Age and the Gayety of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec280.txt')">Life</a>, but
has passed through very conspicuous Scenes in it; though no Soldier, he
has shared the Danger, and acted with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec280.txt')">great</a> Gallantry and Generosity on
a decisive Day of Battle. To have those Qualities which only make other
Men conspicuous in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec280.txt')">World</a> as it were supernumerary to him, is a
Circumstance which gives Weight to his most indifferent Actions; for as
a known Credit is ready Cash to a Trader, so is acknowledged <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec280.txt')">Merit</a>
immediate Distinction, and serves in the Place of Equipage to a
Gentleman. This renders _Polycarpus_ graceful in Mirth, important in
Business, and regarded with Love in every ordinary Occurrence. But not
to dwell upon Characters which have such particular Recommendations to
our Hearts, let us turn our Thoughts rather to the Methods of Pleasing
which must carry Men through the World who cannot pretend to such
Advantages. Falling in with the particular Humour or Manner of one above
you, abstracted from the general Rules of good Behaviour, is the Life of
a Slave. A Parasite differs in nothing from the meanest Servant, but
that the Footman hires himself for bodily Labour, subjected to go and
come at the Will of his Master, but the other gives up his very Soul: He
is prostituted to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec280.txt')">speak</a>, and professes to think after the Mode of him
whom he courts. This Servitude to a Patron, in an honest Nature, would
be more grievous than that of wearing his Livery; therefore we will
speak of those Methods only which are <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec280.txt')">worthy</a> and ingenuous.</p><p>The happy Talent of Pleasing either those above you or below you, seems
to be wholly owing to the Opinion they have of your Sincerity. This
Quality is to attend the agreeable Man in all the Actions of his Life;
and I think there need no more be said in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec280.txt')">Honour</a> of it, than that it is
what forces the Approbation even of your Opponents. The guilty Man has
an Honour for the Judge who with Justice pronounces against him the
Sentence of Death it self. The Author of the Sentence at the Head of
this Paper, was an excellent Judge of human Life, and passed his own in
Company the most agreeable that ever was in the World. _Augustus_ lived
amongst his Friends as if he had his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec280.txt')">Fortune</a> to make in his own Court:
Candour and Affability, accompanied with as much Power as ever Mortal
was vested with, were what made him in the utmost Manner agreeable among
a Set of admirable Men, who had Thoughts too high for <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec280.txt')">Ambition</a>, and
Views too large to be gratified by what he could give them in the
Disposal of an Empire, without the Pleasures of their mutual
Conversation. A certain Unanimity of Taste and Judgment, which is
natural to all of the same Order in the Species, was the Band of this
Society; and the Emperor assumed no Figure in it but what he thought was
his Due from his private Talents and Qualifications, as they contributed
to advance the Pleasures and Sentiments of the Company.</p><p>Cunning <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec280.txt')">People</a>, Hypocrites, all who are but half virtuous, or half wise,
are incapable of tasting the refined Pleasure of such an equal Company
as could wholly exclude the Regard of Fortune in their Conversations.
_Horace_, in the Discourse from whence I take the Hint of the present
Speculation, lays down excellent Rules for Conduct in Conversation with
Men of Power; but he speaks it with an Air of one who had no Need of
such an Application for any thing which related to himself. It shews he
understood what it was to be a skilful Courtier, by just Admonitions
against Importunity, and shewing how forcible it was to speak Modestly
of your own Wants. There is indeed something so shameless in taking all
Opportunities to speak of your own Affairs, that he who is guilty of it
towards him upon whom he depends, fares like the Beggar who exposes his
Sores, which instead of moving Compassion makes the Man he begs of turn
away from the Object.</p><p>I cannot tell what is become of him, but I remember about sixteen Years
ago an honest Fellow, who so justly understood how disagreeable the
Mention or Appearance of his Wants would make him, that I have often
reflected upon him as a Counterpart of _Irus_, whom I have formerly
mentioned. This Man, whom I have missed for some Years in my Walks, and
have heard was someway employed about the Army, made it a Maxim, That
good Wigs, delicate Linen, and a chearful Air, were to a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec280.txt')">poor</a> Dependent
the same that working Tools are to a poor Artificer. It was no small
Entertainment to me, who knew his Circumstances, to see him, who had
fasted two Days, attribute the Thinness they told him of to the Violence
of some Gallantries he had lately been guilty of. The skilful Dissembler
carried this on with the utmost Address; and if any suspected his
Affairs were narrow, it was attributed to indulging himself in some
fashionable Vice rather than an irreproachable <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec280.txt')">Poverty</a>, which saved his
Credit with those on whom he depended.</p><p>The main Art is to be as little troublesome as you can, and make all you
hope for come rather as a Favour from your Patron than Claim from you.
But I am here prating of what is the Method of Pleasing so as to succeed
in the World, when there are Crowds who have, in City, Town, Court, and
Country, arrived at considerable Acquisitions, and yet seem incapable of
acting in any constant Tenour of Life, but have gone on from one
successful Error to another: Therefore I think I may shorten this
Enquiry after the Method of Pleasing; and as the old Beau said to his
Son, once for all, Pray, Jack, _be a fine Gentleman_, so may I, to my
Reader, abridge my Instructions, and finish the Art of Pleasing in a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec280.txt')">Word</a>, Be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec280.txt')">rich</a>.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [that]]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
