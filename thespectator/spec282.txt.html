<p>No. 282.               Wednesday, January 23, 1712.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>[--Spes incerta futuri.</p><p>Virg. [1]]</p><p></p><p>It is a lamentable thing that every Man is full of Complaints, and
constantly uttering Sentences against the Fickleness of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec282.txt')">Fortune</a>, when
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec282.txt')">People</a> generally bring upon themselves all the Calamities they fall
into, and are constantly heaping up Matter for their own <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec282.txt')">Sorrow</a> and
Disappointment. That which produces the greatest Part of the [Delusions
[2]] of Mankind, is a false Hope which People indulge with so sanguine a
Flattery to themselves, that their Hearts are bent upon fantastical
Advantages which they had no Reason to believe should ever have arrived
to them. By this unjust Measure of calculating their Happiness, they
often mourn with real <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec282.txt')">Affliction</a> for imaginary Losses. When I am talking
of this unhappy way of accounting for our selves, I cannot but reflect
upon a particular Set of People, who, in their own Favour, resolve every
thing that is possible into what is probable, and then reckon on that
Probability as on what must certainly happen. WILL. HONEYCOMB, upon my
observing his looking on a <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec282.txt')">Lady</a> with some particular Attention, gave me
an Account of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec282.txt')">great</a> Distresses which had laid waste that her very
fine Face, and had given an Air of Melancholy to a very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec282.txt')">agreeable</a>
Person, That Lady, and a couple of Sisters of hers, were, said WILL.,
fourteen Years ago, the greatest Fortunes about Town; but without having
any Loss by bad Tenants, by bad Securities, or any Damage by Sea or
Land, are reduced to very narrow Circumstances. They were at that time
the most inaccessible haughty Beauties in Town; and their Pretensions to
take upon them at that unmerciful rate, was rais'd upon the following
Scheme, according to which all their Lovers were answered.</p><p>Our Father is a youngish Man, but then our Mother is somewhat older,
and not likely to have any Children: His <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec282.txt')">Estate</a>, being £800 per Annum,
at 20 Years Purchase, is worth £16,000. Our Uncle who is above 50, has
£400 _per Annum_, which at the foresaid Rate, is £8000. There's a Widow
Aunt, who has £10,000 at her own Disposal left by her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec282.txt')">Husband</a>, and an
old Maiden Aunt who has £6000. Then our Fathers Mother has £900 _per
Annum_, which is worth £18,000 and £1000 each of us has of her own,
which cant be taken from us. These summ'd up together stand thus.</p><p>Fathers 800- 16,000  This equally divided between
Uncles  400-   8000  us three amounts to £20,000
Aunts 10,000          each; and Allowance being
6000- 16,000  given for Enlargement upon
Grandmother 900- 18,000  common <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec282.txt')">Fame</a>, we may lawfully
Own 1000 each-   3000  pass for £30,000 Fortunes.
Total- 61,000</p><p>In Prospect of this, and the Knowledge of her own personal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec282.txt')">Merit</a>, every
one was contemptible in their Eyes, and they refus'd those Offers which
had been frequently made em. But _mark the End:_ The Mother dies, the
Father is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec282.txt')">married</a> again, and has a Son, on him was entail'd the
Fathers, Uncles, and Grand-mothers Estate. This cut off £43,000. The
Maiden Aunt married a tall Irishman, and with her went the £6000. The
Widow died, and left but enough to pay her Debts and bury her; so that
there remained for these three Girls but their own £1000. They had [by]
this time passed their Prime, and got on the wrong side of Thirty; and
must pass the Remainder of their Days, upbraiding Mankind that they mind
nothing but <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec282.txt')">Money</a>, and bewailing that Virtue, Sense and Modesty are had
at present in no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec282.txt')">manner</a> of Estimation.</p><p>I mention this Case of Ladies before any other, because it is the most
irreparable: For tho Youth is the Time less capable of Reflection, it
is in that Sex the only Season in which they can advance their Fortunes.
But if we turn our Thoughts to the Men, we see such Crowds of Unhappy
from no other Reason, but an ill-grounded Hope, that it is hard to say
which they rather deserve, our Pity or Contempt. It is not unpleasant to
see a Fellow after grown old in Attendance, and after having passed half
a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec282.txt')">Life</a> in Servitude, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec282.txt')">call</a> himself the unhappiest of all Men, and pretend
to be disappointed because a Courtier broke his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec282.txt')">Word</a>. He that promises
himself any thing but what may naturally arise from his own Property or
Labour, and goes beyond the Desire of possessing above two Parts in
three even of that, lays up for himself an encreasing Heap of
Afflictions and Disappointments. There are but two Means in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec282.txt')">World</a> of
gaining by other Men, and these are by being either agreeable or
considerable. The Generality of Mankind do all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec282.txt')">things</a> for their own
sakes; and when you hope any thing from Persons above you, if you cannot
say, I can be thus agreeable or thus serviceable, it is ridiculous to
pretend to the Dignity of being unfortunate when they leave you; you
were injudicious, in hoping for any other than to be neglected, for such
as can come within these Descriptions of being capable to please or
serve your Patron, when his Humour or Interests call for their Capacity
either way.</p><p>It would not methinks be an useless Comparison between the Condition of
a Man who shuns all the Pleasures of Life, and of one who makes it his
Business to pursue them. Hope in the Recluse makes his Austerities
comfortable, while the luxurious Man gains nothing but Uneasiness from
his Enjoyments. What is the Difference in the Happiness of him who is
macerated by Abstinence, and his who is surfeited with Excess? He who
resigns the World, has no Temptation to Envy, Hatred, Malice, Anger, but
is in constant Possession of a serene Mind; he who follows the Pleasures
of it, which are in their very Nature disappointing, is in constant
Search of Care, Solicitude, Remorse, and Confusion.</p><p>
_January the 14th, 1712_.</p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec282.txt')">Woman</a> and have my Fortune to make; for which Reason I
come constantly to Church to hear Divine Service, and make Conquests:
But one great Hindrance in this my Design, is, that our Clerk, who was
once a Gardener, has this _Christmas_ so over-deckt the Church with
Greens, that he has quite spoilt my Prospect, insomuch that I have
scarce seen the young Baronet I dress at these three Weeks, though we
have both been very constant at our Devotions, and don't sit above
three Pews off. The Church, as it is now equipt, looks more like a
Green-house than a Place of Worship: The middle Isle is a very pretty
shady Walk, and the Pews look like so many Arbours of each Side of it.
The Pulpit itself has such Clusters of Ivy, Holly, and Rosemary about
it, that a light Fellow in our Pew took occasion to say, that the
Congregation heard the Word out of a Bush, like _Moses_. Sir _Anthony
Loves_ Pew in particular is so well hedged, that all my Batteries
have no Effect. I am obliged to shoot at random among the Boughs,
without taking any manner of Aim. _Mr_. SPECTATOR, unless you'll give
Orders for removing these Greens, I shall grow a very awkward Creature
at Church, and soon have little else to do there but to say my
Prayers. I am in haste,</p><p>_<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec282.txt')">Dear</a> SIR_,
_Your most Obedient Servant_,
Jenny Simper.</p><p>
