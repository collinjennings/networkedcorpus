<p>No. 283.               Thursday, January 24, 1712.             Budgell.</p><p></p><p>Magister artis et largitor ingeni
Venter</p><p>Pers.</p><p></p><p>Lucian [1] rallies the Philosophers in his Time, who could not agree
whether they should admit _<a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec283.txt')">Riches</a>_ into the number of _real Goods_; the
Professors of the Severer Sects threw them quite out, while others as
resolutely inserted them.</p><p>I am apt to believe, that as the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec283.txt')">World</a> grew more Polite, the rigid
Doctrines of the first were wholly discarded; and I do not find any one
so hardy at present, as to deny that there are very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec283.txt')">great</a> Advantages in
the Enjoyment of a plentiful <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec283.txt')">Fortune</a>. Indeed the best and wisest of Men,
tho they may possibly despise a good Part of those <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec283.txt')">things</a> which the
World calls Pleasures, can, I think, hardly be insensible of that Weight
and Dignity which a moderate Share of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec283.txt')">Wealth</a> adds to their Characters,
Councils, and Actions.</p><p>We find it is a General Complaint in Professions and Trades, that the
richest Members of them are chiefly encouraged, and this is falsly
imputed to the Ill-nature of Mankind, who are ever bestowing their
Favours on such as least want them. Whereas if we fairly consider their
Proceedings in this Case, we shall find them founded on undoubted
Reason: Since supposing both equal in their natural Integrity, I ought,
in common Prudence, to fear foul Play from an Indigent Person, rather
than from one whose Circumstances seem to have placed him above the bare
Temptation of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec283.txt')">Money</a>.</p><p>This Reason also makes the Common-wealth regard her richest <a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec283.txt')">Subjects</a>, as
those who are most concerned for her Quiet and Interest, and
consequently fittest to be intrusted with her highest Imployments. On
the contrary, _Cataline's_ Saying to those Men of desperate Fortunes,
who applied themselves to him, and of whom he afterwards composed his
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec283.txt')">Army</a>, that _they had nothing to hope for but a Civil <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec283.txt')">War</a>_, was too true
not to make the Impressions he desired.</p><p>I believe I need not fear but that what I have said in Praise of Money,
will be more than sufficient with most of my Readers to excuse the
Subject of my present Paper, which I intend as an Essay on _The Ways to
raise a Man's Fortune_, or, _The Art of growing <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec283.txt')">Rich</a>._</p><p>The first and most infallible Method towards the attaining of this End,
is _Thrift:_ All Men are not equally qualified for getting Money, but it
is in the Power of every one alike to practise this Virtue, and I
believe there are very few Persons, who, if they please to reflect on
their past Lives, will not find that had they saved all those Little
Sums which they have spent unnecessarily, they might at present have
been Masters of a competent Fortune. _Diligence_ justly claims the next
Place to _Thrift:_ I find both these excellently well recommended to
common use in the three following _Italian_ Proverbs,</p><p>Never do that by Proxy which you can do yourself.
Never defer that till To-morrow which you can do To-day.
Never neglect small Matters and Expences.</p><p>A third Instrument of growing Rich, is _Method in Business_, which, as
well as the two former, is also attainable by Persons of the meanest
Capacities.</p><p>The famous _De Wit_, one of the greatest Statesmen of the Age in which
he lived, being asked by a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec283.txt')">Friend</a>, How he was able to dispatch that
Multitude of Affairs in which he was engaged? reply'd, That his whole
Art consisted in doing _one thing at once_. If, says he, I have any
necessary Dispatches to make, I think of nothing else till those are
finished; If any Domestick Affairs require my Attention, I give myself
up wholly to them till they are set in Order.</p><p>In short, we often see Men of dull and phlegmatick Tempers, arriving to
great Estates, by making a regular and orderly Disposition of their
Business, and that without it the greatest Parts and most lively
Imaginations rather puzzle their Affairs, than bring them to an happy
Issue.</p><p>From what has been said, I think I may lay it down as a Maxim, that
every Man of good common Sense may, if he pleases, in his particular
Station of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec283.txt')">Life</a>, most certainly be Rich. The Reason why we sometimes see
that Men of the greatest Capacities are not so, is either because they
despise Wealth in Comparison of something else; or at least are not
content to be getting an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec283.txt')">Estate</a>, unless they may do it their own way,
and at the same time enjoy all the Pleasures and Gratifications of Life.</p><p>But besides these ordinary Forms of growing Rich, it must be allowed
that there is Room for Genius, as well in this as in all other
Circumstances of Life.</p><p>Tho the Ways of getting Money were long since very numerous; and tho
so many new ones have been found out of late Years, there is certainly
still remaining so large a Field for Invention, that a Man of an
indifferent Head might easily sit down and draw up such a Plan for the
Conduct and support of his Life, as was never yet once thought of.</p><p>We daily see Methods put in practice by hungry and ingenious Men, which
demonstrate the Power of Invention in this Particular.</p><p>It is reported of _Scaramouch_, the first famous Italian Comedian, that
being at _Paris_ and in great Want, he bethought himself of constantly
plying near the Door of a noted Perfumer in that City, and when any one
came out who had been buying Snuff, never failed to desire a Taste of
them: when he had by this Means got together a Quantity made up of
several different Sorts, he sold it again at a lower Rate to the same
Perfumer, who finding out the Trick, called it _Tabac de mille fleures_,
or _Snuff of a thousand Flowers_. The Story farther tells us, that by
this means he got a very comfortable Subsistence, till making too much
haste to grow Rich, he one Day took such an unreasonable Pinch out of
the Box of a _Swiss_ Officer, as engaged him in a Quarrel, and obliged
him to quit this Ingenious Way of Life.</p><p>Nor can I in this Place omit doing Justice to a Youth of my own Country,
who, tho he is scarce yet twelve Years old, has with great Industry and
Application attained to the Art of beating the Grenadiers March on his
Chin. I am credibly informed that by this means he does not only
maintain himself and his Mother, but that he is laying up Money every
Day, with a Design, if the War continues, to purchase a Drum at least,
if not a Colours.</p><p>I shall conclude these Instances with the Device of the famous
_Rabelais_, when he was at a great Distance from _Paris_, and without
Money to bear his Expences thither. This ingenious Author being thus
sharp set, got together a convenient Quantity of Brick-Dust, and having
disposed of it into several Papers, writ upon one _Poyson for Monsieur_,
upon a second, _Poyson for the Dauphin_, and on a third, _Poyson for the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec283.txt')">King</a>_. Having made this Provision for the Royal Family of _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec283.txt')">France</a>_, he
laid his Papers so that his Landlord, who was an Inquisitive Man, and a
good Subject, might get a Sight of them.</p><p>The Plot succeeded as he desired: The Host gave immediate Intelligence
to the Secretary of State. The Secretary presently sent down a Special
Messenger, who brought up the Traitor to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec283.txt')">Court</a>, and provided him at the
Kings Expence with proper Accommodations on the Road. As soon as he
appeared he was known to be the Celebrated _Rabelais_, and his Powder
upon Examination being found very Innocent, the Jest was only laught at;
for which a less eminent _Drole_ would have been sent to the Gallies.</p><p>Trade and Commerce might doubtless be still varied a thousand Ways, out
of which would arise such Branches as have not yet been touched. The
famous _Doily_ is still fresh in every ones Memory, who raised a
Fortune by finding out Materials for such Stuffs as might at once be
cheap and genteel. I have heard it affirmed, that had not he discovered
this frugal Method of gratifying our Pride, we should hardly have been
[able[1]] to carry on the last War.</p><p>I regard Trade not only as highly advantageous to the Commonwealth in
general; but as the most natural and likely Method of making a Man's
Fortune, having observed, since my being a _Spectator_ in the World,
greater Estates got about _Change_, than at _Whitehall_ or at St.
_James's_. I believe I may also add, that the first Acquisitions are
generally attended with more Satisfaction, and as good a Conscience.</p><p>I must not however close this Essay, without observing that what has
been said is only intended for Persons in the common ways of Thriving,
and is not designed for those Men who from low Beginnings push
themselves up to the Top of States, and the most considerable Figures in
Life. My Maxim of _Saving_ is not designed for such as these, since
nothing is more usual than for _Thrift_ to disappoint the Ends of
_<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec283.txt')">Ambition</a>_; it being almost impossible that the Mind should [be [2]]
intent upon Trifles, while it is at the same time forming some great
Design.</p><p>I may therefore compare these Men to a great Poet, who, as _Longinus_
says, while he is full of the most magnificent Ideas, is not always at
leisure to mind the little Beauties and Niceties of his Art.</p><p>I would however have all my Readers take great care how they mistake
themselves for uncommon _Genius's_, and Men above Rule, since it is very
easy for them to be deceived in this Particular.</p><p>X.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: In his Auction of Philosophers.]</p><p>
