<p>No. 288.              Wednesday, January 30, 1712.             Steele</p><p></p><p>--Pavor est utrique molestus.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>When you spoke of the Jilts and Coquets, you then promised to be very
impartial, and not to spare even your own <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec288.txt')">Sex</a>, should any of their
secret or open Faults come under your Cognizance; which has given me
Encouragement to describe a certain Species of Mankind under the
Denomination of Male Jilts. They are Gentlemen who do not design to
marry, yet, that they may appear to have some Sense of Gallantry,
think they must pay their Devoirs to one particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec288.txt')">Fair</a>; in order to
which they single out from amongst the Herd of Females her to whom
they design to make their fruitless Addresses. This done, they first
take every Opportunity of being in her <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec288.txt')">Company</a>, and then never fail
upon all Occasions to be particular to her, laying themselves at her
Feet, protesting the Reality of their Passion with a thousand Oaths,
solliciting a Return, and saying as many fine <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec288.txt')">Things</a> as their Stock of
Wit will allow; and if they are not deficient that way, generally
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec288.txt')">speak</a> so as to admit of a double Interpretation; which the credulous
Fair is apt to turn to her own Advantage, since it frequently happens
to be a raw, innocent, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec288.txt')">young</a> Creature, who thinks all the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec288.txt')">World</a> as
sincere as her self, and so her unwary Heart becomes an easy Prey to
those deceitful Monsters, who no sooner perceive it, but immediately
they grow cool, and shun her whom they before seemed so much to
admire, and proceed to act the same common-place Villany towards
another. A Coxcomb flushed with many of these infamous Victories shall
say he is sorry for the <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec288.txt')">poor</a> Fools, protest and vow he never thought
of Matrimony, and wonder talking civilly can be so strangely
misinterpreted. Now, Mr. SPECTATOR, you that are a professed <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec288.txt')">Friend</a> to
Love, will, I hope, observe upon those who abuse that noble Passion,
and raise it in innocent Minds by a deceitful Affectation of it, after
which they desert the Enamoured. Pray bestow a little of your Counsel
to those fond believing Females who already have or are in Danger of
broken Hearts; in which you will oblige a <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec288.txt')">great</a> Part of this Town, but
in a particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec288.txt')">Manner</a>,</p><p>SIR Your (yet Heart-whole) Admirer,
and devoted humble Servant,
Melainia.</p><p></p><p>Melainie's Complaint is occasioned by so general a Folly, that it is
wonderful one could so long overlook it. But this false Gallantry
proceeds from an Impotence of Mind, which makes those who are guilty of
it incapable of pursuing what they themselves approve. Many a Man wishes
a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec288.txt')">Woman</a> his Wife whom he dares not take for such. Tho no one has Power
over his Inclinations or Fortunes, he is a Slave to common <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec288.txt')">Fame</a>. For
this Reason I think Melainia gives them too soft a Name in that of Male
Coquets. I know not why Irresolution of Mind should not be more
contemptible than Impotence of Body; and these frivolous Admirers would
be but tenderly used, in being only included in the same Term with the
Insufficient another Way. They whom my Correspondent calls Male Coquets,
shall hereafter be called Fribblers. A Fribbler is one who professes
Rapture and Admiration for the Woman to whom he addresses, and dreads
nothing so much as her Consent. His Heart can flutter by the Force of
Imagination, but cannot fix from the Force of Judgment. It is not
uncommon for the Parents of young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec288.txt')">Women</a> of moderate <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec288.txt')">Fortune</a> to wink at
the Addresses of Fribblers, and expose their Children to the ambiguous
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec288.txt')">Behaviour</a> which Melainia complains of, till by the Fondness to one they
are to lose, they become incapable of Love towards others, and by
Consequence in their future Marriage lead a joyless or a miserable <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec288.txt')">Life</a>.
As therefore I shall in the Speculations which regard Love be as severe
as I ought on Jilts and Libertine Women, so will I be as little merciful
to insignificant and mischievous Men. In order to this, all Visitants
who frequent Families wherein there are young Females, are forthwith
required to declare themselves, or absent from Places where their
Presence banishes such as would pass their Time more to the Advantage of
those whom they visit. It is a Matter of too great Moment to be dallied
with; and I shall expect from all my young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec288.txt')">People</a> a satisfactory Account
of Appearances. Strephon has from the Publication hereof seven Days to
explain the Riddle he presented to Eudamia; and Chloris an Hour after
this comes to her Hand, to declare whether she will have Philotas, whom
a Woman of no less <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec288.txt')">Merit</a> than her self, and of superior Fortune,
languishes to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec288.txt')">call</a> her own.</p><p></p><p>To the SPECTATOR.</p><p>SIR, [1]
Since so many Dealers turn Authors, and write quaint Advertisements
in praise of their Wares, one who from an Author turn'd Dealer may be
allowed for the Advancement of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec288.txt')">Trade</a> to turn Author again. I will not
however set up like some of em, for selling cheaper than the most
able honest Tradesman can; nor do I send this to be better known for
Choice and Cheapness of China and Japan Wares, Tea, Fans, Muslins,
Pictures, Arrack, and other Indian Goods. Placed as I am in
Leadenhall-street, near the India-Company, and the Centre of that
Trade, Thanks to my fair Customers, my Warehouse is graced as well as
the Benefit Days of my Plays and Operas; and the foreign Goods I sell
seem no less acceptable than the foreign Books I translated, Rabelais
and Don Quixote: This the Criticks allow me, and while they like my
Wares they may dispraise my Writing. But as tis not so well known yet
that I frequently cross the Seas of late, and speaking Dutch and
French, besides other Languages, I have the Conveniency of buying and
importing <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec288.txt')">rich</a> Brocades, Dutch Atlasses, with Gold and Silver, or
without, and other foreign Silks of the newest Modes and best
Fabricks, fine Flanders Lace, Linnens, and Pictures, at the best Hand:
This my new way of Trade I have fallen into I cannot better publish
than by an Application to you. My Wares are fit only for such as your
Readers; and I would beg of you to print this Address in your Paper,
that those whose Minds you adorn may take the Ornaments for their
Persons and Houses from me. This, Sir, if I may presume to beg it,
will be the greater Favour, as I have lately received rich Silks and
fine Lace to a considerable Value, which will be sold cheap for a
quick Return, and as I have also a large Stock of other Goods. Indian
Silks were formerly a great Branch of our Trade; and since we must not
sell em, we must seek Amends by dealing in others. This I hope will
plead for one who would lessen the Number of Teazers of the Muses, and
who, suiting his Spirit to his Circumstances, humbles the Poet to
exalt the Citizen. Like a true Tradesman, I hardly ever look into any
Books but those of Accompts. To say the Truth, I cannot, I think, give
you a better Idea of my being a downright Man of Traffick, than by
acknowledging I oftener read the Advertisements, than the Matter of
even your Paper. I am under a great Temptation to take this
Opportunity of admonishing other Writers to follow my Example, and
trouble the Town no more; but as it is my present Business to increase
the Number of Buyers rather than Sellers, I hasten to tell you that I
am,
SIR, Your most humble,
and most obedient Servant,
Peter Motteux.</p><p>

in Normandy, and came as a refugee to England at the Revocation of the

also as a trader in Leadenhall Street. He had a wife and a fine young
family when (at the age of 56, and six years after the date of this
letter) he was found dead in a house of ill fame near Temple Bar under
