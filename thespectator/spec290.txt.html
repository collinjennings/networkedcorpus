<p>No. 290.              Friday, February 1, 1712.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>[Projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba.</p><p>Hor. [1]]</p><p></p><p>The Players, who know I am very much their <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec290.txt')">Friend</a>, take all
Opportunities to express a Gratitude to me for being so. They could not
have a better Occasion of Obliging me, than one which they lately took
hold of. They desired my Friend WILL. HONEYCOMB to bring me to the
Reading of a new <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec290.txt')">Tragedy</a>; it is called The distressed Mother. [2] I must
confess, tho some Days are passed since I enjoyed that Entertainment,
the Passions of the several Characters dwell strongly upon my
Imagination; and I congratulate to the Age, that they are at last to see
Truth and humane Life represented in the Incidents which concern Heroes
and Heroines. The Stile of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec290.txt')">Play</a> is such as becomes those of the
first Education, and the Sentiments <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec290.txt')">worthy</a> those of the highest Figure.
It was a most exquisite Pleasure to me, to observe real <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec290.txt')">Tears</a> drop from
the Eyes of those who had long made it their Profession to dissemble
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec290.txt')">Affliction</a>; and the Player, who read, frequently throw down the Book,
till he had given vent to the Humanity which rose in him at some
irresistible Touches of the imagined <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec290.txt')">Sorrow</a>. We have seldom had any
Female <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec290.txt')">Distress</a> on the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec290.txt')">Stage</a>, which did not, upon cool Examination,
appear to flow from the Weakness rather than the Misfortune of the
Person represented: But in this Tragedy you are not entertained with the
ungoverned Passions of such as are enamoured of each other merely as
they are Men and <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec290.txt')">Women</a>, but their Regards are founded upon high
Conceptions of each others Virtue and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec290.txt')">Merit</a>; and the Character which
gives Name to the Play, is one who has behaved her self with heroic
Virtue in the most important Circumstances of a Female Life, those of a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec290.txt')">Wife</a>, a Widow, and a Mother. If there be those whose Minds have been too
attentive upon the Affairs of Life, to have any Notion of the Passion of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec290.txt')">Love</a> in such Extremes as are known only to particular Tempers, yet, in
the above-mentioned Considerations, the Sorrow of the Heroine will move
even the Generality of Mankind. Domestick Virtues concern all the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec290.txt')">World</a>,
and there is no one living who is not interested that Andromache should
be an imitable Character. The generous Affection to the Memory of her
deceased <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec290.txt')">Husband</a>, that tender Care for her Son, which is ever heightned
with the Consideration of his Father, and these Regards preserved in
spite of being tempted with the Possession of the highest Greatness, are
what cannot but be venerable even to such an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec290.txt')">Audience</a> as at present
frequents the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec290.txt')">English</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec290.txt')">Theatre</a>. My Friend WILL HONEYCOMB commended
several tender <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec290.txt')">things</a> that were said, and told me they were very
genteel; but whisper'd me, that he feared the Piece was not busy enough
for the present Taste. To supply this, he recommended to the Players to
be very careful in their Scenes, and above all Things, that every <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec290.txt')">Part</a>
should be perfectly new dressed. I was very glad to find that they did
not neglect my Friends Admonition, because there are a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec290.txt')">great</a> many in
his Class of Criticism who may be gained by it; but indeed the Truth is,
that as to the Work it self, it is every where Nature. The Persons are
of the highest Quality in Life, even that of Princes; but their Quality
is not represented by the Poet with Direction that Guards and Waiters
should follow them in every Scene, but their Grandeur appears in
Greatness of  Sentiment[s], flowing from Minds worthy their Condition.
To make a Character truly Great, this Author understands that it should
have its Foundation in superior Thoughts and Maxims of Conduct. It is
very certain, that many an honest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec290.txt')">Woman</a> would make no Difficulty, tho
she had been the Wife of Hector, for the sake of a Kingdom, to marry the
Enemy of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec290.txt')">Husbands</a> Family and Country; and indeed who can deny but
she might be still an honest Woman, but no Heroine? That may be
defensible, nay laudable in one Character, which would be in the highest
Degree exceptionable in another. When Cato Uticensis killed himself,
Cottius a Roman of ordinary Quality and Character did the same thing;
upon which one said, smiling, Cottius might have lived, tho CÃ¦sar has
seized the Roman Liberty. Cottius's Condition might have been the
same, let things at the upper End of the World pass as they would. What
is further very extraordinary in this Work, is, that the Persons are all
of them laudable, and their Misfortunes arise rather from unguarded
Virtue than Propensity to Vice. The Town has an Opportunity of doing
itself Justice in supporting the Representation of Passion, Sorrow,
Indignation, even Despair itself, within the Rules of Decency, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec290.txt')">Honour</a>
and Good-breeding; and since there is no one can flatter himself his
Life will be always fortunate, they may here see Sorrow as they would
wish to bear it whenever it arrives.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am appointed to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec290.txt')">act</a> a Part in the new Tragedy called The Distressed
Mother: It is the celebrated <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec290.txt')">Grief</a> of Orestes which I am to personate;
but I shall not act it as I ought, for I shall feel it too intimately
to be able to utter it. I was last Night repeating a Paragraph to my
self, which I took to be an Expression of Rage, and in the middle of
the Sentence there was a Stroke of Self-pity which quite unmanned me.
Be pleased, Sir, to print this Letter, that when I am oppressed in
this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec290.txt')">manner</a> at such an Interval, a certain Part of the Audience may
not think I am out; and I hope with this Allowance to do it to
Satisfaction. I am, SIR,
Your most humble Servant,
George Powell.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>As I was walking tother Day in the Park, I saw a Gentleman with a
very short Face; I desire to know whether it was you. Pray inform me
as soon as you can, lest I become the most heroick Hecatissa's Rival.</p><p>Your humble Servant to command,</p><p>SOPHIA.</p><p>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec290.txt')">Dear</a> Madam,</p><p>It is not me you are in love with, for I was very ill and kept my
Chamber all that Day.</p><p>Your most humble Servant,</p><p>The SPECTATOR.</p><p>
T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1:</p><p>[Spirat Tragicum satis, et foeliciter Audet.</p><p>Hor.]]</p><p>

Philips, who had now been adapting Racine's Andromaque.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
