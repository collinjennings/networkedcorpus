<p>No. 294.            Wednesday, February 6, 1712.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>Difficile est plurimum virtutem revereri qui semper secunda fortuna
sit usus.</p><p>Tull. ad Herennium.</p><p></p><p>Insolence is the Crime of all others which every Man is most apt to rail
at; and yet is there one <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec294.txt')">Respect</a> in which almost all Men living are
guilty of it, and that is in the Case of laying a greater Value upon the
Gifts of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec294.txt')">Fortune</a> than we ought. It is here in England come into our very
Language, as a Propriety of Distinction, to say, when we would <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec294.txt')">speak</a> of
Persons to their Advantage, they are <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec294.txt')">People</a> of Condition. There is no
doubt but the proper Use of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec294.txt')">Riches</a> implies that a Man should exert all
the good Qualities imaginable; and if we mean by a Man of Condition or
Quality, one who, according to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec294.txt')">Wealth</a> he is Master of, shews himself
just, beneficent, and charitable, that Term ought very deservedly to be
had in the highest Veneration; but when Wealth is used only as it is the
Support of Pomp and Luxury, to be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec294.txt')">rich</a> is very far from being a
Recommendation to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec294.txt')">Honour</a> and Respect. It is indeed the greatest
Insolence imaginable, in a Creature who would feel the Extreams of
Thirst and Hunger, if he did not prevent his Appetites before they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec294.txt')">call</a>
upon him, to be so forgetful of the common Necessity of Human Nature, as
never to cast an Eye upon the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec294.txt')">Poor</a> and Needy. The Fellow who escaped
from a Ship which struck upon a Rock in the West, and join'd with the
Country People to destroy his Brother Sailors and make her a Wreck, was
thought a most execrable Creature; but does not every Man who enjoys the
Possession of what he naturally wants, and is unmindful of the
unsupplied Distress of other Men, betray the same Temper of Mind? When a
Man looks about him, and with regard to Riches and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec294.txt')">Poverty</a> beholds some
drawn in Pomp and Equipage, and they and their very Servants with an Air
of Scorn and Triumph overlooking the Multitude that pass by them; and,
in the same Street, a Creature of the same Make crying out in the Name
of all that is Good and Sacred to behold his Misery, and give him some
Supply against Hunger and Nakedness, who would believe these two Beings
were of the same Species? But so it is, that the Consideration of
Fortune has taken up all our Minds, and, as I have often complained,
Poverty and Riches stand in our Imaginations in the Places of Guilt and
Innocence. But in all Seasons there will be some Instances of Persons
who have Souls too large to be taken with popular Prejudices, and while
the rest of Mankind are contending for Superiority in Power and Wealth,
have their Thoughts bent upon the Necessities of those below them. The
Charity-Schools which have been erected of late Years, are the greatest
Instances of publick Spirit the Age has produced: But indeed when we
consider how long this Sort of Beneficence has been on Foot, it is
rather from the good Management of those Institutions, than from the
Number or Value of the Benefactions to them, that they make so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec294.txt')">great</a> a
Figure. One would think it impossible, that in the Space of fourteen
Years there should not have been five thousand Pounds bestowed in Gifts
this Way, nor sixteen hundred Children, including Males and Females, put
out to Methods of Industry. It is not allowed me to speak of Luxury and
Folly with the severe Spirit they deserve; I shall only therefore say, I
shall very readily compound with any Lady in a Hoop-Petticoat, if she
gives the Price of one half Yard of the Silk towards Cloathing, Feeding
and Instructing an Innocent helpless Creature of her own Sex in one of
these Schools. The Consciousness of such an Action will give her
Features a nobler <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec294.txt')">Life</a> on this illustrious Day, [1] than all the Jewels
that can hang in her Hair, or can be clustered at her Bosom. It would be
uncourtly to speak in harsher Words to the Fair, but to Men one may take
a little more Freedom. It is monstrous how a Man can live with so little
Reflection, as to fancy he is not in a Condition very unjust and
disproportioned to the rest of Mankind, while he enjoys Wealth, and
exerts no Benevolence or Bounty to others. As for this particular
Occasion of these Schools, there cannot any offer more <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec294.txt')">worthy</a> a generous
Mind. Would you do an handsome thing without Return? do it for an Infant
that is not sensible of the Obligation: Would you do it for publick
Good? do it for one who will be an honest Artificer: Would you do it for
the Sake of Heaven? give it to one who shall be instructed in the
Worship of him for whose Sake you gave it. It is methinks a most
laudable Institution this, if it were of no other Expectation than that
of producing a Race of good and useful Servants, who will have more than
a liberal, a religious Education. What would not a Man do, in common
Prudence, to lay out in Purchase of one about him, who would add to all
his Orders he gave the Weight of the Commandments to inforce an
Obedience to them? for one who would consider his Master as his Father,
his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec294.txt')">Friend</a>, and Benefactor, upon the easy Terms, and in Expectation of
no other Return but moderate Wages and gentle Usage? It is the common
Vice of Children to run too much among the Servants; from such as are
educated in these Places they would see nothing but Lowliness in the
Servant, which would not be disingenuous in the Child. All the ill
Offices and defamatory Whispers which take their Birth from Domesticks,
would be prevented, if this Charity could be made universal; and a good
Man might have a Knowledge of the whole Life of the Persons he designs
to take into his House for his own Service, or that of his Family or
Children, long before they were admitted. This would create endearing
Dependencies: and the Obligation would have a paternal Air in the
Master, who would be relieved from much Care and Anxiety from the
Gratitude and Diligence of an humble Friend attending him as his
Servant. I fall into this Discourse from a Letter sent to me, to give me
Notice that Fifty Boys would be Cloathed, and take their Seats (at the
Charge of some generous Benefactors) in St. Brides Church on Sunday
next. I wish I could promise to my self any thing which my Correspondent
seems to expect from a Publication of it in this Paper; for there can be
nothing added to what so many excellent and learned Men have said on
this Occasion: But that there may be something here which would move a
generous Mind, like that of him who writ to me, I shall transcribe an
handsome Paragraph of Dr. Snape's Sermon on these Charities, which my
Correspondent enclosed with this Letter.</p><p>The wise Providence has amply compensated the Disadvantages of the
Poor and Indigent, in wanting many of the Conveniencies of this Life,
by a more abundant Provision for their Happiness in the next. Had they
been higher born, or more richly endowed, they would have wanted this
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec294.txt')">Manner</a> of Education, of which those only enjoy the Benefit, who are
low enough to submit to it; where they have such Advantages without
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec294.txt')">Money</a>, and without Price, as the Rich cannot purchase with it. The
Learning which is given, is generally more edifying to them, than that
which is sold to others: Thus do they become more exalted in Goodness,
by being depressed in Fortune, and their Poverty is, in Reality, their
Preferment. [2]</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Queen Anne's birthday. She was born Feb. 6, 1665, and died
