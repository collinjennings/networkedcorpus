<p>No. 295.            Thursday, February 7, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>Prodiga non sentit pereuntem fæmina censum:
At velut exhaustâ redivivus pullulet arcâ
Nummus, et è pleno semper tollatur acervo,
Non unquam reputat quanti sibi gandia constent.</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am turned of my <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec295.txt')">great</a> Climacteric, and am naturally a Man of a meek
Temper. About a dozen Years ago I was <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec295.txt')">married</a>, for my Sins, to a young
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec295.txt')">Woman</a> of a good Family, and of an high Spirit; but could not bring her
to close with me, before I had entered into a Treaty with her longer
than that of the Grand Alliance. Among other Articles, it was therein
stipulated, that she should have £400 a Year for Pin-<a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec295.txt')">money</a>, which I
obliged my self to pay Quarterly into the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec295.txt')">hands</a> of one who had acted
as her Plenipotentiary in that Affair. I have ever since religiously
observed my part in this solemn Agreement. Now, Sir, so it is, that
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec295.txt')">Lady</a> has had several Children since I married her; to which, if I
should credit our malicious Neighbours, her Pin-money has not a little
contributed. The Education of these my Children, who, contrary to my
Expectation, are born to me every Year, streightens me so much, that I
have begged their Mother to free me from the Obligation of the
above-mentioned Pin-money, that it may go towards making a Provision
for her Family. This Proposal makes her noble Blood swell in her
Veins, insomuch that finding me a little tardy in her last Quarters
Payment, she threatens me every Day to arrest me; and proceeds so far
as to tell me, that if I do not do her Justice, I shall die in a Jayl.
To this she adds, when her Passion will let her argue calmly, that she
has several Play-Debts on her Hand, which must be discharged very
suddenly, and that she cannot lose her Money as becomes a Woman of her
<a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec295.txt')">Fashion</a>, if she makes me any Abatements in this Article. I hope, Sir,
you will take an Occasion from hence to give your Opinion upon a
Subject which you have not yet touched, and inform us if there are any
Precedents for this Usage among our Ancestors; or whether you find any
mention of Pin-money in Grotius, Puffendorf, or any other of the
Civilians.</p><p>I am ever
the humblest of your Admirers,
Josiah Fribble, Esq.</p><p>
As there is no Man living who is a more professed Advocate for the Fair
Sex than my self, so there is none that would be more unwilling to
invade any of their ancient Rights and Privileges; but as the Doctrine
of Pin-money is of a very late Date, unknown to our Great Grandmothers,
and not yet received by many of our Modern Ladies, I think it is for the
Interest of both Sexes to keep it from spreading.</p><p>Mr. Fribble may not, perhaps, be much mistaken where he intimates, that
the supplying a Man's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec295.txt')">Wife</a> with Pin-money, is furnishing her with Arms
against himself, and in a manner becoming accessary to his own
Dishonour. We may indeed, generally observe, that in proportion as a
Woman is more or less Beautiful, and her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec295.txt')">Husband</a> advanced in Years, she
stands in need of a greater or less number of Pins, and upon a Treaty of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec295.txt')">Marriage</a>, rises or falls in her Demands accordingly. It must likewise be
owned, that high Quality in a Mistress does very much inflame this
Article in the Marriage Reckoning.</p><p>But where the Age and Circumstances of both Parties are pretty much upon
a level, I cannot but think the insisting upon Pin-money is very
extraordinary; and yet we find several Matches broken off upon this very
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec295.txt')">Head</a>. What would a Foreigner, or one who is a Stranger to this Practice,
think of a Lover that forsakes his Mistress, because he is not willing
to keep her in Pins; but what would he think of the Mistress, should he
be informed that she asks five or six <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec295.txt')">hundred</a> Pounds a Year for this
use? Should a Man unacquainted with our Customs be told the Sums which
are allowed in Great Britain, under the Title of Pin-money, what a
prodigious Consumption of Pins would he think there was in this Island?
A Pin a Day, says our frugal Proverb, is a Groat a Year, so that
according to this Calculation, my Friend Fribbles Wife must every Year
make use of Eight Millions six hundred and forty thousand new Pins.</p><p>I am not ignorant that our British Ladies allege they comprehend under
this general Term several other Conveniencies of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec295.txt')">Life</a>; I could therefore
wish, for the Honour of my Countrywomen, that they had rather called it
Needle-Money, which might have implied something of Good-housewifry, and
not have given the malicious World occasion to think, that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec295.txt')">Dress</a> and
Trifles have always the uppermost Place in a Woman's Thoughts.</p><p>I know several of my fair Reasoners urge, in defence of this Practice,
that it is but a necessary Provision they make for themselves, in case
their Husband proves a Churl or a Miser; so that they consider this
Allowance as a kind of Alimony, which they may lay their Claim to,
without actually separating from their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec295.txt')">Husbands</a>. But with Submission, I
think a Woman who will give up her self to a Man in Marriage, where
there is the least Room for such an Apprehension, and trust her Person
to one whom she will not rely on for the common Necessaries of Life, may
very properly be accused (in the Phrase of an homely Proverb) of being
Penny wise and Pound foolish.</p><p>It is observed of over-cautious Generals, that they never engage in a
Battel without securing a Retreat, in case the Event should not answer
their Expectations; on the other hand, the greatest Conquerors have
burnt their Ships, or broke down the Bridges behind them, as being
determined either to succeed or die in the Engagement. In the same
manner I should very much suspect a Woman who takes such Precautions for
her Retreat, and contrives Methods how she may live happily, without the
Affection of one to whom she joins herself for Life. Separate Purses
between Man and Wife are, in my Opinion, as unnatural as separate Beds.
A Marriage cannot be happy, where the Pleasures, Inclinations, and
Interests of both Parties are not the same. There is no greater
Incitement to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec295.txt')">Love</a> in the Mind of Man, than the Sense of a Persons
depending upon him for her Ease and Happiness; as a Woman uses all her
Endeavours to please the Person whom she looks upon as her Honour, her
Comfort, and her Support.</p><p>For this Reason I am not very much surprized at the Behaviour of a rough
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec295.txt')">Country</a> Squire, who, being not a little shocked at the Proceeding of a
young Widow that would not recede from her Demands of Pin-money, was so
enraged at her mercenary Temper, that he told her in great Wrath, As
much as she thought him her Slave, he would shew all the World he did
not care a Pin for her. Upon which he flew out of the Room, and never
saw her more.</p><p>Socrates, in Plato's Altibiades, says, he was informed by one, who had
travelled through Persia, that as he passed over a great Tract of Lands,
and enquired what the Name of the Place was, they told him it was the
Queens Girdle; to which he adds, that another wide Field which lay by
it, was called the Queens Veil; and that in the same Manner there was a
large Portion of Ground set aside for every part of Her Majesty's
Dress. These Lands might not be improperly called the Queen of Persia's
Pin-money.</p><p>I remember my Friend Sir ROGER, who I dare say never read this Passage
in Plato, told me some time since, that upon his courting the Perverse
Widow (of whom I have given an Account in former Papers) he had disposed
of an hundred Acres in a Diamond-Ring, which he would have presented her
with, had she thought fit to accept it; and that upon her Wedding-Day
she should have carried on her Head fifty of the tallest Oaks upon his
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec295.txt')">Estate</a>. He further informed me that he would have given her a Cole-pit
to keep her in clean Linnen, that he would have allowed her the Profits
of a Windmill for her Fans, and have presented her once in three Years
with the Sheering of his Sheep [for her [1]] Under-Petticoats. To which
the Knight always adds, that though he did not care for fine Cloaths
himself, there should not have been a Woman in the Country better
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec295.txt')">dressed</a> than my Lady Coverley. Sir ROGER perhaps, may in this, as well
as in many other of his Devices, appear something odd and singular, but
if the Humour of Pin-money prevails, I think it would be very proper for
every Gentleman of an Estate to mark out so many Acres of it under the
Title of The Pins.</p><p>L.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [to keep her in]]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
