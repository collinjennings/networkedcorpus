<p>No. 298.              Monday, February 11, 1712.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>Nusquam Tuta fides.</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>London, Feb. 9, 1711-12.</p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a Virgin, and in no Case despicable; but yet such as I am I must
remain, or else become, tis to be feared, less happy: for I find not
the least good Effect from the just Correction you some time since
gave, that too free, that looser Part of our <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec298.txt')">Sex</a> which spoils the Men;
the same Connivance at the Vices, the same easie Admittance of
Addresses, the same vitiated Relish of the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec298.txt')">Conversation</a> of the
greatest of Rakes (or in a more fashionable Way of expressing ones
self, of such as have seen the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec298.txt')">World</a> most) still abounds, increases,
multiplies.</p><p>The humble Petition therefore of many of the most strictly <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec298.txt')">virtuous</a>,
and of my self, is, That you'll once more exert your Authority, and
that according to your late Promise, your full, your impartial
Authority, on this sillier Branch of our Kind: For why should they be
the uncontroulable Mistresses of our Fate? Why should they with
Impunity indulge the Males in Licentiousness whilst single, and we
have the dismal Hazard and Plague of reforming them when <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec298.txt')">married</a>?
Strike home, Sir, then, and spare not, or all our maiden Hopes, our
gilded Hopes of nuptial Felicity are frustrated, are vanished, and you
your self, as well as Mr. Courtly, will, by smoothing over immodest
Practices with the Gloss of soft and harmless Names, for ever forfeit
our Esteem. Nor think that I'm herein more severe than need be: If I
have not reason more than enough, do you and the World judge from this
ensuing Account, which, I think, will prove the Evil to be universal.</p><p>You must know then, that since your Reprehension of this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec298.txt')">Female</a>
Degeneracy came out, I've had a Tender of Respects from no less than
five Persons, of tolerable Figure too as Times go: But the Misfortune
is, that four of the five are professed Followers of the Mode. They
would face me down, that all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec298.txt')">Women</a> of good Sense ever were, and ever
will be, Latitudinarians in Wedlock; and always did, and will, give
and take what they profanely term Conjugal Liberty of Conscience.</p><p>The two first of them, a Captain and a Merchant, to strengthen their
Argument, pretend to repeat after a Couple, a Brace of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec298.txt')">Ladies</a> of
Quality and Wit, That Venus was always kind to Mars; and what Soul
that has the least spark of Generosity, can deny a Man of Bravery any
thing? And how pitiful a Trader that, whom no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec298.txt')">Woman</a> but his own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec298.txt')">Wife</a>
will have Correspondence and Dealings with? Thus these; whilst the
third, the Country Squire, confessed, That indeed he was surprized
into good Breeding, and entered into the Knowledge of the World
unawares. That dining tother Day at a Gentleman's House, the Person
who entertained was obliged to leave him with his Wife and Nieces;
where they spoke with so much Contempt of an absent Gentleman for
being slow at a Hint, that he had resolved never to be drowsy,
unmannerly, or stupid for the future at a Friends House; and on a
hunting Morning, not to pursue the Game either with the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec298.txt')">Husband</a>
abroad, or with the Wife at home.</p><p>The next that came was a Tradesman, [no [1]] less full of the Age
than the former; for he had the Gallantry to tell me, that at a late
Junket which he was invited to, the Motion being made, and the
Question being put, twas by Maid, Wife and Widow resolved nemine
contradicente, That a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec298.txt')">young</a> sprightly Journeyman is absolutely
necessary in their Way of Business: To which they had the Assent and
Concurrence of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec298.txt')">Husbands</a> present. I dropped him a Curtsy, and gave
him to understand that was his Audience of Leave.</p><p>I am reckoned <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec298.txt')">pretty</a>, and have had very many Advances besides these;
but have been very averse to hear any of them, from my Observation on
these above-mentioned, till I hoped some Good from the Character of
my present Admirer, a Clergyman. But I find even amongst them there
are indirect Practices in relation to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec298.txt')">Love</a>, and our Treaty is at
present a little in Suspence, till some Circumstances are cleared.
There is a Charge against him among the Women, and the Case is this:
It is alledged, That a certain endowed Female would have appropriated
her self to and consolidated her self with a Church, which my Divine
now enjoys; (or, which is the same thing, did prostitute her self to
her Friends doing this for her): That my Ecclesiastick, to obtain the
one, did engage himself to take off the other that lay on Hand; but
that on his Success in the Spiritual, he again renounced the Carnal.</p><p>I put this closely to him, and taxed him with Disingenuity. He to
clear himself made the subsequent Defence, and that in the most solemn
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec298.txt')">Manner</a> possible: That he was applied to and instigated to accept of a
Benefice: That a conditional Offer thereof was indeed made him at
first, but with Disdain by him rejected: That when nothing (as they
easily perceived) of this Nature could bring him to their Purpose,
Assurance of his being entirely unengaged before-hand, and safe from
all their After-Expectations (the only Stratagem left to draw him in)
was given him: That pursuant to this the Donation it self was without
Delay, before several reputable Witnesses, tendered to him gratis,
with the open Profession of not the least Reserve, or most minute
Condition; but that yet immediately after Induction, his insidious
Introducer (or her crafty Procurer, which you will) industriously
spread the Report, which had reached my Ears, not only in the
Neighbourhood of that said Church, but in London, in the University,
in mine and his own County, and where-ever else it might probably
obviate his Application to any other Woman, and so confine him to this
alone: And, in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec298.txt')">Word</a>, That as he never did make any previous Offer of
his Service, or the least Step to her Affection; so on his Discovery
of these Designs thus laid to trick him, he could not but afterwards,
in Justice to himself, vindicate both his Innocence and Freedom by
keeping his proper Distance.</p><p>This is his Apology, and I think I shall be satisfied with it. But I
cannot conclude my tedious Epistle, without recommending to you not
only to resume your former Chastisement, but to add to your Criminals
the Simoniacal Ladies, who seduce the sacred Order into the Difficulty
of either breaking a mercenary Troth made to them whom they ought not
to deceive, or by breaking or keeping it offending against him whom
they cannot deceive. Your Assistance and Labours of this sort would be
of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec298.txt')">great</a> Benefit, and your speedy Thoughts on this Subject would be
very seasonable to,</p><p>SIR, Your most obedient Servant,
Chastity Loveworth.</p><p>
