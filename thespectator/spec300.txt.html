<p>No. 300.            Wednesday, February 13, 1712.             Steele.</p><p></p><p>Diversum vitio vitium prope majus.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>When you talk of the Subject of <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec300.txt')">Love</a>, and the Relations arising from
it, methinks you should take Care to leave no Fault unobserved which
concerns the State of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec300.txt')">Marriage</a>. The great Vexation that I have
observed in it, is, that the wedded Couple seem to want Opportunities
of being often enough alone together, and are forced to quarrel and be
fond before <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec300.txt')">Company</a>. Mr. Hotspur and his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec300.txt')">Lady</a>, in a Room full of their
Friends, are ever saying something so smart to each other, and that
but just within Rules, that the whole Company stand in the utmost
Anxiety and Suspence for fear of their falling into Extremities which
they could not be present at. On the other Side, Tom Faddle and his
<a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec300.txt')">pretty</a> Spouse where-ever they come are billing at such a Rate, as they
think must do our Hearts good who behold em. Cannot you possibly
propose a Mean between being Wasps and Doves in Publick? I should
think if you advised to hate or love sincerely it would be better: For
if they would be so discreet as to hate from the very Bottom of their
Hearts, their Aversion would be too strong for little Gibes every
Moment; and if they loved with that calm and noble Value which dwells
in the Heart, with a Warmth like that of Life-Blood, they would not be
so impatient of their Passion as to fall into observable Fondness.
This Method, in each Case, would save Appearances; but as those who
offend on the fond Side are by much the fewer, I would have you begin
with them, and go on to take Notice of a most impertinent Licence
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec300.txt')">married</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec300.txt')">Women</a> take, not only to be very loving to their Spouses in
Publick, but also make nauseous Allusions to private Familiarities,
and the like. Lucina is a Lady of the greatest Discretion, you must
know, in the World; and withal very much a Physician: Upon the
Strength of these two Qualities there is nothing she will not <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec300.txt')">speak</a> of
before us Virgins; and she every Day talks with a very grave Air in
such a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec300.txt')">Manner</a>, as is very improper so much as to be hinted at but to
obviate the greatest Extremity. Those whom they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec300.txt')">call</a> good Bodies,
notable <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec300.txt')">People</a>, hearty Neighbours, and the purest goodest Company in
the World, are the great Offenders in this Kind. Here I think I have
laid before you an open Field for Pleasantry; and hope you will shew
these People that at least they are not witty: In which you will save
from many a Blush a daily Sufferer, who is very much</p><p>Your most humble Servant,
Susanna Loveworth.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>In yours of Wednesday the 30th past, you and your Correspondent are
very severe on a sort of Men, whom you call Male Coquets; but without
any other Reason, in my Apprehension, than that of paying a shallow
Compliment to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec300.txt')">fair</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec300.txt')">Sex</a>, by accusing some Men of imaginary <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec300.txt')">Faults</a>,
that the Women may not seem to be the more faulty Sex; though at the
same time you suppose there are some so weak as to be imposed upon by
fine Things and false Addresses. I cant persuade my self that your
Design is to debar the Sexes the Benefit of each others <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec300.txt')">Conversation</a>
within the Rules of Honour; nor will you, I dare say, recommend to
em, or encourage the common Tea-Table Talk, much less that of
Politicks and Matters of State: And if these are forbidden Subjects of
Discourse, then, as long as there are any Women in the World who take
a Pleasure in hearing themselves praised, and can bear the Sight of a
Man prostrate at their Feet, so long I shall make no Wonder that there
are those of the other Sex who will pay them those impertinent
Humiliations. We should have few People such Fools as to practise
Flattery, if all were so wise as to despise it. I don't deny but you
would do a meritorious Act, if you could prevent all Impositions on
the Simplicity of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec300.txt')">young</a> Women; but I must confess I don't apprehend
you have laid the Fault on the proper Person, and if I trouble you
with my Thoughts upon it I promise my self your Pardon. Such of the
Sex as are raw and innocent, and most exposed to these Attacks, have,
or their Parents are much to blame if they have not, one to advise and
guard em, and are obliged themselves to take Care of em: but if
these, who ought to hinder Men from all Opportunities of this sort of
Conversation, instead of that encourage and promote it, the Suspicion
is very just that there are some private Reasons for it; and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec300.txt')">Ill</a>
leave it to you to determine on which Side a Part is then acted. Some
Women there are who are arrived at Years of Discretion, I mean are got
out of the Hands of their Parents and Governours, and are set up for
themselves, who yet are liable to these Attempts; but if these are
prevailed upon, you must excuse me if I lay the Fault upon them, that
their Wisdom is not grown with their Years. My Client, Mr. Strephon,
whom you summoned to declare himself, gives you Thanks however for
your Warning, and begs the Favour only to inlarge his Time for a Week,
or to the last Day of the Term, and then hell appear gratis, and pray
no Day over.
Yours,
Philanthropes.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I was last Night to visit a Lady who I much esteem, and always took
for my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec300.txt')">Friend</a>; but met with so very different a Reception from what I
expected, that I cannot help applying my self to you on this Occasion.
In the room of that Civility and Familiarity I used to be treated with
by her, an affected Strangeness in her Looks, and Coldness in her
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec300.txt')">Behaviour</a>, plainly told me I was not the welcome Guest which the
Regard and Tenderness she has often expressed for me gave me Reason to
flatter my self to think I was. Sir, this is certainly a great Fault,
and I assure you a very common one; therefore I hope you will think it
a fit Subject for some Part of a Spectator. Be pleased to acquaint us
how we must behave our selves towards this valetudinary Friendship,
subject to so many Heats and Colds, and you will oblige,
SIR, Your humble Servant,
Miranda.</p><p>
SIR,</p><p>I cannot forbear acknowledging the Delight your late Spectators on
Saturdays have given me; for it is writ in the honest Spirit of
Criticism, and called to my Mind the following four Lines I had read
long since in a Prologue to a Play called Julius CÃ¦<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec300.txt')">sar</a> [1] which has
deserved a better Fate. The Verses are addressed to the little
Criticks.</p><p>Shew your small Talent, and let that suffice ye;
But grow not vain upon it, I advise ye.
For every Fop can find out Faults in Plays:
You'll ne'er arrive at Knowing when to praise.</p><p>Yours, D. G.</p><p>

Scotia to colonize, and was secretary of state for Scotland.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
