<p>No. 304.               Monday, February 18, 1712.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>Vulnus alit venis et c√¶co carpitur igni.</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>The Circumstances of my Correspondent, whose Letter I now insert, are so
frequent, that I cannot want Compassion so much as to forbear laying it
before the Town. There is something so mean and inhuman in a direct
Smithfield Bargain for Children, that if this Lover carries his Point,
and observes the Rules he pretends to follow, I do not only wish him
Success, but also that it may animate others to follow his Example. I
know not one Motive relating to this <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec304.txt')">Life</a> which would produce so many
honourable and <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec304.txt')">worthy</a> Actions, as the Hopes of obtaining a Woman of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec304.txt')">Merit</a>: There would ten thousand Ways of Industry and honest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec304.txt')">Ambition</a> be
pursued by young Men, who believed that the Persons admired had Value
enough for their Passion to attend the Event of their good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec304.txt')">Fortune</a> in
all their Applications, in order to make their Circumstances fall in
with the Duties they owe to themselves, their Families, and their
<a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec304.txt')">Country</a>; All these Relations a Man should think of who intends to go
into the State of Marriage, and expects to make it a State of Pleasure
and Satisfaction.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I have for some Years indulged a Passion for a young Lady of Age and
Quality suitable to my own, but very much superior in Fortune. It is
the Fashion with Parents (how justly I leave you to judge) to make all
Regards give way to the Article of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec304.txt')">Wealth</a>. From this one Consideration
it is that I have concealed the ardent Love I have for her; but I am
beholden to the Force of my Love for many Advantages which I reaped
from it towards the better Conduct of my Life. A certain Complacency
to all the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec304.txt')">World</a>, a strong Desire to oblige where-ever it lay in my
Power, and a circumspect <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec304.txt')">Behaviour</a> in all my Words and Actions, have
rendered me more particularly acceptable to all my Friends and
Acquaintance. Love has had the same good Effect upon my Fortune; and I
have encreased in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec304.txt')">Riches</a> in proportion to my Advancement in those Arts
which make a man <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec304.txt')">agreeable</a> and amiable. There is a certain Sympathy
which will tell my Mistress from these Circumstances, that it is I who
writ this for her Reading, if you will please to insert it. There is
not a downright Enmity, but a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec304.txt')">great</a> Coldness between our Parents; so
that if either of us declared any kind Sentiment for each other, her
Friends would be very backward to lay an Obligation upon our Family,
and mine to receive it from hers. Under these delicate Circumstances
it is no easie Matter to act with Safety. I have no Reason to fancy my
Mistress has any Regard for me, but from a very disinterested Value
which I have for her. If from any Hint in any future Paper of yours
she gives me the least Encouragement, I doubt not but I shall surmount
all other Difficulties; and inspired by so noble a Motive for the Care
of my Fortune, as the Belief she is to be concerned in it, I will not
despair of receiving her one Day from her Fathers own Hand.</p><p>I am, SIR,
Your most obedient humble Servant,
Clytander.</p><p>
To his Worship the SPECTATOR,</p><p>The humble Petition of Anthony Title-Page, Stationer, in the Centre of
Lincoln's-Inn-Fields,</p><p>Sheweth,
That your Petitioner and his Fore-Fathers have been Sellers of Books
for Time immemorial; That your Petitioners Ancestor, Crouchback
Title-Page, was the first of that Vocation in Britain; who keeping his
Station (in fair Weather) at the Corner of Lothbury, was by way of
Eminency called the Stationer, a Name which from him all succeeding
Booksellers have affected to bear: That the Station of your Petitioner
and his Father has been in the Place of his present Settlement ever
since that Square has been built: That your Petitioner has formerly
had the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec304.txt')">Honour</a> of your Worships Custom, and hopes you never had
Reason to complain of your Penny-worths; that particularly he sold you
your first Lilly's Grammar, and at the same Time a Wits Commonwealth
almost as good as new: Moreover, that your first rudimental Essays in
Spectatorship were made in your Petitioners Shop, where you often
practised for Hours together, sometimes on his Books upon the Rails,
sometimes on the little Hieroglyphicks either gilt, silvered, or
plain, which the Egyptian Woman on the other Side of the Shop had
wrought in Gingerbread, and sometimes on the English Youth, who in
sundry Places there were exercising themselves in the traditional
Sports of the Field.</p><p>From these Considerations it is, that your Petitioner is encouraged to
apply himself to you, and to proceed humbly to acquaint your Worship,
That he has certain Intelligence that you receive great Numbers of
defamatory Letters designed by their Authors to be published, which
you throw aside and totally neglect: Your Petitioner therefore prays,
that you will please to bestow on him those Refuse Letters, and he
hopes by printing them to get a more plentiful Provision for his
Family; or at the worst, he may be allowed to sell them by the Pound
Weight to his good Customers the Pastry-Cooks of London and
Westminster. And your Petitioner shall ever pray, &c.</p><p></p><p>To the SPECTATOR,</p><p>The humble Petition of Bartholomew Ladylove, of Round-Court in the
Parish of St. Martins in the Fields, in Behalf of himself and
Neighbours,</p><p>Sheweth,</p><p>That your Petitioners have with great Industry and Application arrived
at the most exact Art of Invitation or Entreaty: That by a beseeching
Air and perswasive Address, they have for many Years last past
peaceably drawn in every tenth Passenger, whether they intended or not
to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec304.txt')">call</a> at their Shops, to come in and buy; and from that Softness of
Behaviour, have arrived among Tradesmen at the gentle Appellation of
the Fawners.</p><p>That there have of late set up amongst us certain Persons of
Monmouth-street and Long-lane, who by the Strength of their Arms, and
Loudness of their Throats, draw off the Regard of all Passengers from
your said Petitioners; from which Violence they are distinguished by
the Name of the Worriers.</p><p>That while your Petitioners stand ready to receive Passengers with a
submissive Bow, and repeat with a gentle Voice, Ladies, what do you
want? pray look in here; the Worriers reach out their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec304.txt')">Hands</a> at
Pistol-shot, and seize the Customers at Arms Length.</p><p>That while the Fawners strain and relax the Muscles of their Faces in
making Distinction between a Spinster in a coloured Scarf and an
Handmaid in a Straw-Hat, the Worriers use the same Roughness to both,
and prevail upon the Easiness of the Passengers, to the Impoverishment
of your Petitioners.</p><p>Your Petitioners therefore most humbly pray, that the Worriers may not
be permitted to inhabit the politer Parts of the Town; and that
Round-Court may remain a Receptacle for Buyers of a more soft
Education.</p><p>And your Petitioners, &c.</p><p>
The Petition of the New-Exchange, concerning the Arts of Buying and
Selling, and particularly valuing Goods by the Complexion of the Seller,
will be considered on another Occasion.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
