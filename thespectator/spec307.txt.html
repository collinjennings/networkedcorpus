<p>No. 307.            Thursday, February 21, 1712.               Budgell.</p><p></p><p>--Versate diu quid ferre recusent
Quid valeant humeri--</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I am so well pleased with the following Letter, that I am in hopes it
will not be a disagreeable Present to the Publick.</p><p></p><p>Sir,
Though I believe none of your Readers more admire your agreeable
manner of working up Trifles than my self, yet as your Speculations
are now swelling into Volumes, and will in all Probability pass down
to future Ages, methinks I would have no single Subject in them,
wherein the general Good of Mankind is concern'd, left unfinished.</p><p>I have a long time expected with great Impatience that you would
enlarge upon the ordinary Mistakes which are committed in the
<a name="topic23" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec307.txt')">Education</a> of our <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec307.txt')">Children</a>. I the more easily flattered my self that
you would one time or other resume this Consideration, because you
tell us that your 168th Paper was only composed of a few broken Hints;
but finding myself hitherto disappointed, I have ventur'd to send you
my own Thoughts on this Subject.</p><p>I remember Pericles in his famous Oration at the Funeral of those
Athenian young Men who perished in the Samian Expedition, has a
Thought very much celebrated by several Ancient Criticks, namely, That
the Loss which the Commonwealth suffered by the Destruction of its
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec307.txt')">Youth</a>, was like the Loss which the Year would suffer by the
Destruction of the Spring. The Prejudice which the Publick sustains
from a wrong Education of Children, is an Evil of the same Nature, as
it in a manner starves Posterity, and defrauds our Country of those
Persons who, with due <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec307.txt')">Care</a>, might make an eminent Figure in their
respective Posts of Life.</p><p>I have seen a Book written by Juan Huartes,[1] a Spanish Physician,
entitled Examen de Ingenios, wherein he lays it down as one of his
first Positions, that Nothing but Nature can qualifie a Man for
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec307.txt')">Learning</a>; and that without a proper Temperament for the particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec307.txt')">Art</a>
or Science which he studies, his utmost Pains and Application,
assisted by the ablest Masters, will be to no purpose.</p><p>He illustrates this by the Example of Tully's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec307.txt')">Son</a> Marcus.</p><p>Cicero, in order to accomplish his Son in that sort of Learning which
he designed him for, sent him to Athens, the most celebrated Academy
at that time in the World, and where a vast Concourse, out of the most
Polite Nations, could not but furnish a young Gentleman with a
Multitude of great Examples, and Accidents that might insensibly have
instructed him in his designed Studies: He placed him under the Care
of Cratippus, who was one of the greatest Philosophers of the Age,
and, as if all the Books which were at that time written had not been
sufficient for his Use, he composed others on purpose for him:
Notwithstanding all this, History informs us, that Marcus proved a
meer Blockhead, and that Nature, (who it seems was even with the Son
for her Prodigality to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec307.txt')">Father</a>) rendered him incapable of improving
by all the Rules of Eloquence, the Precepts of Philosophy, his own
Endeavours, and the most refined Conversation in Athens. This <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec307.txt')">Author</a>
therefore proposes, that there should be certain Tryers or Examiners
appointed by the State to inspect the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec307.txt')">Genius</a> of every particular Boy,
and to allot him the Part that is most suitable to his natural
Talents.</p><p>Plato in one of his Dialogues tells us, that Socrates, who was the
Son of a Midwife, used to say, that as his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec307.txt')">Mother</a>, tho she was very
skilful in her Profession, could not deliver a Woman, unless she was
first with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec307.txt')">Child</a>; so neither could he himself raise <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec307.txt')">Knowledge</a> out of a
Mind, where Nature had not planted it.</p><p>Accordingly the Method this Philosopher took, of instructing his
Scholars by several Interrogatories or Questions, was only helping the
Birth, and bringing their own Thoughts to Light.</p><p>The Spanish Doctor above mentioned, as his Speculations grow more
refined, asserts that every <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec307.txt')">kind</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec307.txt')">Wit</a> has a particular Science
corresponding to it, and in which alone it can be truly Excellent. As
to those Genius's, which may seem to have an equal Aptitude for
several things, he regards them as so many unfinished Pieces of Nature
wrought off in haste.</p><p>There are, indeed, but very few to whom Nature has been so unkind,
that they are not capable of shining in some Science or other. There
is a certain Byass towards Knowledge in every Mind, which may be
strengthened and improved by proper Applications.</p><p>The Story of Clavius [2] is very well known; he was entered in a
College of Jesuits, and after having been tryed at several Parts of
Learning, was upon the Point of being dismissed as an hopeless
Blockhead, till one of the Fathers took it into his Head to make an
assay of his Parts in Geometry, which it seems hit his Genius so
luckily that he afterwards became one of the greatest Mathematicians
of the Age. It is commonly thought that the Sagacity of these Fathers,
in discovering the Talent of a young Student, has not a little
contributed to the Figure which their Order has made in the World.</p><p>How different from this manner of Education is that which prevails in
our own Country? Where nothing is more usual than to see forty or
fifty Boys of several Ages, Tempers and Inclinations, ranged together
in the same Class, employed upon the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec307.txt')">Authors</a>, and enjoyned the
same Tasks? Whatever their natural Genius may be, they are all to be
made Poets, Historians, and Orators alike. They are all obliged to
have the same Capacity, to bring in the same Tale of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec307.txt')">Verse</a>, and to
furnish out the same Portion of Prose. Every Boy is bound to have as
good a Memory as the Captain of the Form. To be brief, instead of
adapting Studies to the particular Genius of a Youth, we expect from
the young Man, that he should adapt his Genius to his Studies. This, I
must confess, is not so much to be imputed to the Instructor, as to
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec307.txt')">Parent</a>, who will never be brought to believe, that his Son is not
capable of performing as much as his Neighbours, and that he may not
make him whatever he has a Mind to.</p><p>If the present Age is more laudable than those which have gone before
it in any single Particular, it is in that generous Care which several
well-disposed Persons have taken in the Education of poor Children;
and as in these Charity-Schools there is no Place left for the
over-weening Fondness of a Parent, the Directors of them would make
them beneficial to the Publick, if they considered the Precept which I
have been thus long inculcating. They might easily, by well examining
the Parts of those under their Inspection, make a just Distribution of
them into proper Classes and Divisions, and allot to them this or that
particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec307.txt')">Study</a>, as their Genius qualifies them for Professions,
Trades, Handicrafts, or Service by Sea or Land.</p><p>How is this kind of Regulation wanting in the three great
Professions!</p><p>Dr. South complaining of Persons who took upon them Holy Orders, tho
altogether unqualified for the Sacred Function, says somewhere, that
many a Man runs his Head against a Pulpit, who might have done his
Country excellent Service at a Plough-tail.</p><p>In like manner many a Lawyer, who makes but an indifferent Figure at
the Bar, might have made a very elegant Waterman, and have shined at
the Temple Stairs, tho he can get no Business in the House.</p><p>I have known a Corn-cutter, who with a right Education would have
been an excellent Physician.</p><p>To descend lower, are not our Streets filled with sagacious Draymen,
and Politicians in Liveries? We have several Taylors of six Foot high,
and meet with many a broad pair of Shoulders that are thrown away upon
a Barber, when perhaps at the same time we see a pigmy Porter reeling
under a Burthen, who might have managed a Needle with much Dexterity,
or have snapped his Fingers with great Ease to himself, and Advantage
to the Publick.</p><p>The Spartans, tho they acted with the Spirit which I am here
speaking of, carried it much farther than what I propose: Among them
it was not lawful for the Father himself to bring up his Children
after his own Fancy. As soon as they were seven Years old they were
all listed in several Companies, and disciplined by the Publick. The
old Men were Spectators of their Performances, who often raised
Quarrels among them, and set them at Strife with one another, that by
those early Discoveries they might see how their several Talents lay,
and without any regard to their Quality, dispose of them accordingly
for the Service of the Commonwealth. By this Means Sparta soon became
the Mistress of Greece, and famous through the whole World for her
Civil and Military Discipline.</p><p>If you think this Letter deserves a place among your Speculations, I
may perhaps trouble you with some other Thoughts on the same Subject.
I am, &c.</p><p>

credit in the sixteenth century for the book here cited. It was

[Footnote 2: Christopher Clavius, a native of Bamberg, died in 1612,
aged 75, at Rome, whither he had been sent by the Jesuits, and where he
was regarded as the Euclid of his age. It was Clavius whom Pope Gregory
XIII. employed in 1581 to effect the reform in the Roman Calendar
promulgated in 1582, when the 5th of October became throughout Catholic
countries the 15th of the New Style, an improvement that was not
admitted into Protestant England until 1752. Clavius wrote an Arithmetic
and Commentaries on Euclid, and justified his reform of the Calendar
against the criticism of Scaliger.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
