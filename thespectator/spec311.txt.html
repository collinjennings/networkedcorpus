<p>No. 311.               Tuesday, February 26, 1712.             Addison.</p><p>
Nec Veneris pharetris macer est; aut lampade fervet:
Inde faces ardent, veniunt a dote sagittæ.</p><p>Juv.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am amazed that among all the Variety of Characters, with which you
have enriched your Speculations, you have never given us a Picture of
those audacious <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec311.txt')">young</a> Fellows among us, who commonly go by the Name of
<a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec311.txt')">Fortune</a>-Stealers. You must know, Sir, I am one who live in a continual
Apprehension of this sort of People that lye in wait, Day and Night,
for our <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec311.txt')">Children</a>, and may be considered as a kind of Kidnappers within
the Law. I am the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec311.txt')">Father</a> of a Young Heiress, whom I begin to look upon
as Marriageable, and who has looked upon her self as such for above
these Six Years. She is now in the Eighteenth Year of her Age. The
Fortune-hunters have already cast their Eyes upon her, and take <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec311.txt')">care</a>
to plant themselves in her View whenever she appears in any Publick
Assembly. I have my self caught a young Jackanapes with a pair of
Silver Fringed Gloves, in the very Fact. You must know, Sir, I have
kept her as a Prisoner of State ever since she was in her Teens. Her
Chamber Windows are cross-barred, she is not permitted to go out of
the House but with her Keeper, who is a stay'd Relation of my own; I
have likewise forbid her the use of Pen and Ink for this Twelve-Month
last past, and do not suffer a Ban-box to be carried into her Room
before it has been searched. Notwithstanding these Precautions, I am
at my Wits End for fear of any sudden Surprize. There were, two or
three Nights ago, some Fiddles heard in the Street, which I am afraid
portend me no Good; not to mention a tall Irish-Man, that has been
seen walking before my House more than once this Winter. My Kinswoman
likewise informs me, that the Girl has talked to her twice or thrice
of a Gentleman in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec311.txt')">Fair</a> Wig, and that she loves to go to Church more
than ever she did in her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec311.txt')">Life</a>. She gave me the slip about a Week ago,
upon which my whole House was in Alarm. I immediately dispatched a Hue
and Cry after her to the Change, to her Mantua-maker, and to the young
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec311.txt')">Ladies</a> that Visit her; but after above an Hours search she returned
of herself, having been taking a Walk, as she told me, by Rosamond's
Pond. I have hereupon turned off her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec311.txt')">Woman</a>, doubled her Guards, and
given new Instructions to my Relation, who, to give her her due, keeps
a watchful Eye over all her Motions. This, Sir, keeps me in a
perpetual Anxiety, and makes me very often watch when my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec311.txt')">Daughter</a>
sleeps, as I am afraid she is even with me in her turn. Now, Sir, what
I would desire of you is, to represent to this fluttering Tribe of
young Fellows, who are for making their Fortunes by these indirect
Means, that stealing a Man's Daughter for the sake of her Portion, is
but a kind of Tolerated Robbery; and that they make but a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec311.txt')">poor</a> Amends
to the Father, whom they plunder after this Manner, by going to bed
with his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec311.txt')">Child</a>. <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec311.txt')">Dear</a> Sir, be speedy in your Thoughts on this Subject,
that, if possible, they may appear before the Disbanding of the Army.</p><p>I am, SIR,</p><p>Your most humble Servant,</p><p>Tim. Watchwell.</p><p>
Themistocles, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec311.txt')">great</a> Athenian General, being asked whether he would
chuse to marry his Daughter to an indigent Man of Merit, or to a
worthless Man of an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec311.txt')">Estate</a>, replied, That he should prefer a Man without
an Estate, to an Estate without a Man. The worst of it is, our Modern
Fortune-Hunters are those who turn their Heads that way, because they
are good for nothing else. If a young Fellow finds he can make nothing
of Cook and Littleton, he provides himself with a Ladder of Ropes, and
by that means very often enters upon the Premises.</p><p>The same Art of Scaling has likewise been practised with good Success by
many military Ingineers. Stratagems of this nature make Parts and
Industry superfluous, and cut short the way to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec311.txt')">Riches</a>.</p><p>Nor is Vanity a less Motive than Idleness to this kind of Mercenary
Pursuit. A Fop who admires his Person in a Glass, soon enters into a
Resolution of making his Fortune by it, not questioning but every Woman
that falls in his way will do him as much Justice as he does himself.
When an Heiress sees a Man throwing particular Graces into his Ogle, or
talking loud within her Hearing, she ought to look to her self; but if
withal she observes a pair of Red-Heels, a Patch, or any other
Particularity in his Dress, she cannot take too much care of her Person.
These are Baits not to be trifled with, Charms that have done a world of
Execution, and made their way into Hearts which have been thought
impregnable. The Force of a Man with these Qualifications is so well
known, that I am credibly informed there are several <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec311.txt')">Female</a> Undertakers
about the Change, who upon the Arrival of a likely Man out of a
neighbouring Kingdom, will furnish him with proper Dress from Head to
Foot, to be paid for at a double Price on the Day of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec311.txt')">Marriage</a>.</p><p>We must however distinguish between Fortune-Hunters and
Fortune-Stealers. The first are those assiduous Gentlemen who employ
their whole Lives in the Chace, without ever coming at the Quarry.
Suffenus has combed and powdered at the Ladies for thirty Years
together, and taken his Stand in a Side Box, till he has grown wrinkled
under their Eyes. He is now laying the same Snares for the present
Generation of Beauties, which he practised on their Mothers. Cottilus,
after having made his Applications to more than you meet with in Mr.
Cowley's Ballad of Mistresses, was at last smitten with a City <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec311.txt')">Lady</a> of
20,000£. Sterling: but died of old Age before he could bring Matters to
bear. Nor must I here omit my worthy Friend Mr. HONEYCOMB, who has often
told us in the Club, that for twenty years successively, upon the death
of a Childless <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec311.txt')">rich</a> Man, he immediately drew on his Boots, called for
his Horse, and made up to the Widow. When he is rallied upon his ill
Success, WILL, with his usual Gaiety tells us, that he always found [her
[1]] Pre-engaged.</p><p>Widows are indeed the great Game of your Fortune-Hunters. There is
scarce a young Fellow in the Town of six Foot high, that has not passed
in Review before one or other of these wealthy Relicts. Hudibrass's
Cupid, who</p><p>--took his Stand
Upon a Widows Jointure Land, [2]</p><p>is daily employed in throwing Darts, and kindling Flames. But as for
Widows, they are such a Subtle Generation of People, that they may be
left to their own Conduct; or if they make a false Step in it, they are
answerable for it to no Body but themselves. The young innocent
Creatures who have no Knowledge and Experience of the World, are those
whose Safety I would principally consult in this Speculation. The
stealing of such an one should, in my Opinion, be as punishable as a
Rape. Where there is no Judgment there is no Choice; and why the
inveigling a Woman before she is come to Years of Discretion, should not
be as Criminal as the seducing of her before she is ten Years old, I am
at a Loss to comprehend.</p><p>L.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: them]</p><p>
