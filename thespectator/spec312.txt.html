<p>No. 312.             Wednesday, February 27, 1712.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>Quod huic Officium, qu√¶ laus, quod Decus erit tanti, quod adipisci
cum colore Corporis velit, qui dolorem summum malum sibi persuaserit?
Quam porro quis ignominiam, quam turpitudinem non pertulerit, ut
effugiat dolorem, si id summum malum esse decrevit?</p><p>Tull. de Dolore tolerando.</p><p></p><p>It is a very melancholy Reflection, that Men are usually so weak, that
it is absolutely necessary for them to know <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec312.txt')">Sorrow</a> and Pain to be in
their right Senses. Prosperous <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec312.txt')">People</a> (for Happy there are none) are
hurried away with a fond Sense of their present Condition, and
thoughtless of the Mutability of Fortune: Fortune is a Term which we
must use in such Discourses as these, for what is wrought by the unseen
Hand of the Disposer of all <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec312.txt')">Things</a>. But methinks the Disposition of a
Mind which is truly <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec312.txt')">great</a>, is that which makes Misfortunes and Sorrows
little when they befall our selves, great and lamentable when they
befall other Men. The most unpardonable Malefactor in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec312.txt')">World</a> going to
his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec312.txt')">Death</a> and bearing it with Composure, would win the Pity of those who
should behold him; and this not because his Calamity is deplorable, but
because he seems himself not to deplore it: We suffer for him who is
less sensible of his own Misery, and are inclined to despise him who
sinks under the Weight of his Distresses. On the other hand, without any
Touch of Envy, a temperate and well-govern'd Mind looks down on such as
are exalted with Success, with a certain Shame for the Imbecility of
human Nature, that can so far forget how liable it is to Calamity, as to
grow giddy with only the Suspence of Sorrow, which is the Portion of all
Men. He therefore who turns his Face from the unhappy Man, who will not
look again when his Eye is cast upon modest Sorrow, who shuns <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec312.txt')">Affliction</a>
like a Contagion, does but pamper himself up for a Sacrifice, and
contract in himself a greater Aptitude to Misery by attempting to escape
it. A Gentleman where I happened to be last Night, fell into a Discourse
which I thought shewed a good Discerning in him: He took Notice that
whenever Men have looked into their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec312.txt')">Heart</a> for the Idea of true
Excellency in human Nature, they have found it to consist in Suffering
after a right <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec312.txt')">Manner</a> and with a good Grace. Heroes are always drawn
bearing Sorrows, struggling with Adversities, undergoing all kinds of
Hardships, and having in the Service of Mankind a kind of Appetite to
Difficulties and Dangers. The Gentleman went on to observe, that it is
from this secret Sense of the high <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec312.txt')">Merit</a> which there is in Patience
under Calamities, that the Writers of Romances, when they attempt to
furnish out Characters of the highest Excellence, ransack Nature for
things terrible; they raise a new Creation of Monsters, Dragons, and
Giants: Where the Danger ends, the Hero ceases; when he won an Empire,
or gained his Mistress, the rest of his Story is not worth relating. My
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec312.txt')">Friend</a> carried his Discourse so far as to say, that it was for higher
Beings than Men to join Happiness and Greatness in the same Idea; but
that in our Condition we have no Conception of superlative Excellence,
or Heroism, but as it is surrounded with a Shade of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec312.txt')">Distress</a>.</p><p>It is certainly the proper Education we should give our selves, to be
prepared for the ill Events and Accidents we are to meet with in a Life
sentenced to be a Scene of Sorrow: But instead of this Expectation, we
soften our selves with Prospects of constant Delight, and destroy in our
Minds the Seeds of Fortitude and Virtue, which should support us in
Hours of Anguish. The constant Pursuit of Pleasure has in it something
insolent and improper for our Being. There is a pretty sober Liveliness
in the Ode of Horace to Delius, where he tells him, loud Mirth, or
immoderate Sorrow, Inequality of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec312.txt')">Behaviour</a> either in Prosperity or
Adversity, are alike ungraceful in Man that is born to die. Moderation
in both Circumstances is peculiar to generous Minds: Men of that Sort
ever taste the Gratifications of Health, and all other Advantages of
Life, as if they were liable to part with them, and when bereft of them,
resign them with a Greatness of Mind which shews they know their Value
and Duration. The Contempt of Pleasure is a certain Preparatory for the
Contempt of Pain: Without this, the Mind is as it were taken suddenly by
any unforeseen Event; but he that has always, during Health and
Prosperity, been abstinent in his Satisfactions, enjoys, in the worst of
Difficulties, the Reflection, that his Anguish is not aggravated with
the Comparison of past Pleasures which upbraid his present Condition.
Tully tells us a Story after Pompey, which gives us a good Taste of the
pleasant Manner the Men of Wit and Philosophy had in old Times of
alleviating the Distresses of Life by the Force of Reason and
Philosophy. Pompey, when he came to Rhodes, had a Curiosity to visit the
famous Philosopher Possidonius; but finding him in his sick Bed, he
bewailed the Misfortune that he should not hear a Discourse from him:
But you may, answered Possidonius; and immediately entered into the
Point of Stoical Philosophy, which says Pain is not an Evil. During the
Discourse, upon every Puncture he felt from his Distemper, he smiled and
cried out, Pain, Pain, be as impertinent and troublesome as you please,
I shall never own that thou art an Evil.</p><p>
Mr. Spectator,
Having seen in several of your Papers, a Concern for the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec312.txt')">Honour</a> of the
Clergy, and their doing every thing as becomes their Character, and
particularly performing the publick Service with a due Zeal and
<a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec312.txt')">Devotion</a>; I am the more encouraged to lay before them, by your Means,
several Expressions used by some of them in their Prayers before
Sermon, which I am not well satisfied in: As their giving some Titles
and Epithets to great Men, which are indeed due to them in their
several Ranks and Stations, but not properly used, I think, in our
Prayers. Is it not Contradiction to say, Illustrious, Right, Reverend,
and Right Honourable poor Sinners? These Distinctions are suited only
to our State here, and have no place in Heaven: We see they are
omitted in the Liturgy; which I think the Clergy should take for their
Pattern in their own Forms of [Devotion. [1]] There is another
Expression which I would not mention, but that I have heard it several
times before a learned Congregation, to bring in the last Petition of
the Prayer in these Words, O let not the Lord be angry and I will
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec312.txt')">speak</a> but this once; as if there was no Difference between Abraham's
interceding for Sodom, for which he had no Warrant as we can find, and
our asking those Things which we are required to pray for; they would
therefore have much more Reason to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec312.txt')">fear</a> his Anger if they did not make
such Petitions to him. There is another pretty Fancy: When a young Man
has a Mind to let us know who gave him his Scarf, he speaks a
Parenthesis to the Almighty, Bless, as I am in Duty bound to pray, the
right honourable the Countess; is not that as much as to say, Bless
her, for thou knowest I am her Chaplain?</p><p>Your humble Servant,</p><p>J. O.</p><p>
T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Devotion. Another Expression which I take to be improper,
is this, the whole Race of Mankind, when they pray for all Men; for Race
signifies Lineage or Descent; and if the Race of Mankind may be used for
the present generation, (though I think not very fitly) the whole Race
takes in all from the Beginning to the End of the World. I don't
remember to have met with that Expression in their sense anywhere but in
the old Version of Psal. 14, which those Men, I suppose, have but little
Esteem for. And some, when they have prayed for all Schools and Nurserys
of good Learning and True <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec312.txt')">Religion</a>, especially the two Universities, add
these Words, Grant that from them and all other Places dedicated to thy
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec312.txt')">Worship</a> and Service, may come forth such Persons. But what do they mean
by all other Places? It seems to me that this is either a Tautology, as
being the same with all Schools and Nurserys before expressed, or else
it runs too far; for there are general Places dedicated to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec312.txt')">Divine</a>
Service which cannot properly be intended here.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
