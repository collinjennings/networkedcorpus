<p>No. 313.            Thursday, February 28, 1712.               Budgell.</p><p></p><p>Exigite ut mores teneros ceu pollice ducat,
Ut si quis cerâ vultum facit.</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>I shall give the following Letter no other Recommendation, than by
telling my Readers that it comes from the same Hand with that of last
_Thursday_.</p><p>
Sir,</p><p>I send you, according to my Promise, some farther Thoughts on the
<a name="topic23" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec313.txt')">Education</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec313.txt')">Youth</a>, in which I intend to discuss that famous Question,
_Whether the Education at a publick <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec313.txt')">School</a>, or under a private Tutor,
is to be preferred_?</p><p>As some of the greatest Men in most Ages have been of very different
Opinions in this Matter, I shall give a short Account of what I think
may be best urged on both sides, and afterwards leave every Person to
determine for himself.</p><p>It is certain from _Suetonius_, that the Romans thought the Education
of their Children a business properly belonging to the Parents
themselves; and Plutarch, in the Life of Marcus Cato, tells us, that
as soon as his Son was capable of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec313.txt')">Learning</a>, Cato would suffer no Body
to Teach him but himself, tho he had a Servant named Chilo, who was
an excellent Grammarian, and who <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec313.txt')">taught</a> a <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec313.txt')">great</a> many other Youths.</p><p>On the contrary, the Greeks seemed more inclined to Publick Schools
and Seminaries.</p><p>A private Education promises in the first place <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec313.txt')">Virtue</a> and
Good-Breeding; a publick School Manly Assurance, and an early
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec313.txt')">Knowledge</a> in the Ways of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec313.txt')">World</a>.</p><p>Mr. Locke in his celebrated Treatise of Education [1], confesses
that there are Inconveniencies to be feared on both sides; If, says
he,  I keep my Son at Home, he is in danger of becoming my young
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec313.txt')">Master</a>; If I send him Abroad, it is scarce possible to keep him from
the reigning Contagion of Rudeness and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec313.txt')">Vice</a>. He will perhaps be more
Innocent at Home, but more ignorant of the World, and more sheepish
when he comes Abroad.  However, as this learned Author asserts, That
Virtue is much more difficult to be attained than Knowledge of the
World; and that Vice is a more stubborn, as well as a more dangerous
Fault than Sheepishness, he is altogether for a private Education; and
the more so, because he does not see why a Youth, with right
Management, might not attain the same Assurance in his Fathers House,
as at a publick School. To this end he advises Parents to accustom
their Sons to whatever strange Faces come to the House; to take them
with them when they Visit their Neighbours, and to engage them in
Conversation with Men of Parts and Breeding.</p><p>It may be objected to this Method, that Conversation is not the only
thing necessary, but that unless it be a Conversation with such as are
in some measure their Equals in Parts and Years, there can be no room
for Emulation, Contention, and several of the most lively <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec313.txt')">Passions</a> of
the Mind; which, without being sometimes moved by these means, may
possibly contract a Dulness and Insensibility.</p><p>One of the greatest Writers our Nation ever produced observes, That a
Boy who forms Parties, and makes himself Popular in a School or a
College, would act the same Part with equal ease in a Senate or a
Privy Council; and Mr. Osborn speaking like a Man versed in the Ways
of the World, affirms, that the well laying and carrying on of a
design to rob an Orchard, trains up a Youth insensibly to Caution,
Secrecy and Circumspection, and fits him for Matters of greater
Importance.</p><p>In short, a private Education seems the most natural Method for the
forming of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec313.txt')">virtuous</a> Man; a Publick Education for making a Man of
Business. The first would furnish out a good Subject for Plato's
Republick, the latter a Member for a Community over-run with Artifice
and Corruption.</p><p>It must however be confessed, that a Person at the head of a publick
School has sometimes so many Boys under his Direction, that it is
impossible he should extend a due proportion of his Care to each of
them. This is, however, in reality, the Fault of the Age, in which we
often see twenty Parents, who tho each expects his Son should be made
a Scholar, are not contented altogether to make it worth while for any
Man of a liberal Education to take upon him the Care of their
Instruction.</p><p>In our great Schools indeed this Fault has been of late Years
rectified, so that we have at present not only Ingenious Men for the
chief Masters, but such as have proper Ushers and Assistants under
them; I must nevertheless own, that for want of the same Encouragement
in the Country, we have many a promising <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec313.txt')">Genius</a> spoiled and abused in
those Seminaries.</p><p>I am the more inclined to this Opinion, having my self experienced
the Usage of two Rural Masters, each of them very unfit for the Trust
they took upon them to discharge. The first imposed much more upon me
than my Parts, tho none of the weakest, could endure; and used me
barbarously for not performing Impossibilities. The latter was of
quite another Temper; and a Boy, who would run upon his Errands, wash
his Coffee-pot, or ring the Bell, might have as little Conversation
with any of the Classicks as he thought fit. I have known a Lad at
this Place excused his Exercise for assisting the Cook-maid; and
remember a Neighbouring Gentleman's Son was among us five Years, most
of which time he employed in airing and watering our Masters grey
Pad. I scorned to Compound for my Faults, by doing any of these
Elegant Offices, and was accordingly the best Scholar, and the worst
used of any Boy in the School.</p><p>I shall conclude this Discourse with an Advantage mentioned by
Quintilian, as accompanying a Publick way of Education, which I have
not yet taken notice of; namely, That we very often contract such
Friendships at School, as are a Service to us all the following Part
of our Lives.</p><p>I shall give you, under this Head, a Story very well known to several
Persons, and which you may depend upon as a real Truth.</p><p>Every one, who is acquainted with Westminster-School, knows that
there is a Curtain which used to be drawn a-cross the Room, to
separate the upper School from the lower. A Youth happened, by some
Mischance, to tear the above-mentioned Curtain: The Severity of the
Master [2] was too well known for the Criminal to expect any Pardon
for such a Fault; so that the Boy, who was of a meek Temper, was
terrified to Death at the Thoughts of his Appearance, when his Friend,
who sat next to him, bad him be of good Cheer, for that he would take
the Fault on himself. He kept his word accordingly. As soon as they
were grown up to be Men the Civil War broke out, in which our two
Friends took the opposite Sides, one of them followed the Parliament,
the other the Royal Party.</p><p>As their Tempers were different, the Youth, who had torn the Curtain,
endeavoured to raise himself on the Civil List, and the other, who had
born the Blame of it, on the Military: The first succeeded so well,
that he was in a short time made a Judge under the Protector. The
other was engaged in the unhappy Enterprize of Penruddock and Groves
in the West. I suppose, Sir, I need not acquaint you with the Event of
that Undertaking. Every one knows that the Royal Party was routed, and
all the Heads of them, among whom was the Curtain Champion, imprisoned
at Exeter. It happened to be his Friends Lot at that time to go to
the Western Circuit: The Tryal of the Rebels, as they were then
called, was very short, and nothing now remained but to pass Sentence
on them; when the Judge hearing the Name of his old Friend, and
observing his Face more attentively, which he had not seen for many
Years, asked him, if he was not formerly a Westminster-Scholar; by the
Answer, he was soon convinced that it was his former generous Friend;
and, without saying any thing more at that time, made the best of his
Way to London, where employing all his Power and Interest with the
Protector, he saved his Friend from the Fate of his unhappy
Associates.</p><p>The Gentleman, whose Life was thus preserv'd by the Gratitude of his
School-Fellow, was afterwards the Father of a Son, whom he lived to
see promoted in the Church, and who still deservedly fills one of the
highest Stations in it. [3]</p><p>
