<p>No. 318.              Wednesday, March 5, 1712.                 Steele.</p><p></p><p>[--non omnia possumus omnes.</p><p>Virg. [1]]</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>A certain Vice which you have lately attacked, has not yet been
considered by you as growing so deep in the <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec318.txt')">Heart</a> of Man, that the
Affectation outlives the Practice of it. You must have observed that
Men who have been bred in Arms preserve to the most extreme and feeble
old Age a certain Daring in their Aspect: In like <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec318.txt')">manner</a>, they who
have pass'd their Time in Gallantry and Adventure, keep up, as well as
they can, the Appearance of it, and carry a petulant Inclination to
their last Moments. Let this serve for a Preface to a Relation I am
going to give you of an old Beau in Town, that has not only been
amorous, and a Follower of <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec318.txt')">Women</a> in general, but also, in Spite of the
Admonition of grey Hairs, been from his sixty-third Year to his
present seventieth, in an actual Pursuit of a young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec318.txt')">Lady</a>, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec318.txt')">Wife</a> of
his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec318.txt')">Friend</a>, and a Man of <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec318.txt')">Merit</a>. The gay old Escalus has Wit, good
Health, and is perfectly well bred; but from the Fashion and Manners
of the Court when he was in his Bloom, has such a natural Tendency to
amorous Adventure, that he thought it would be an endless Reproach to
him to make no use of a Familiarity he was allowed at a Gentleman's
House, whose good Humour and Confidence exposed his Wife to the
Addresses of any who should take it in their Head to do him the good
Office. It is not impossible that Escalus might also resent that the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec318.txt')">Husband</a> was particularly negligent of him; and tho he gave many
Intimations of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec318.txt')">Passion</a> towards the Wife, the Husband either did not
see them, or put him to the Contempt of over-looking them. In the mean
time Isabella, for so we shall <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec318.txt')">call</a> our Heroine, saw his Passion, and
rejoiced in it as a Foundation for much Diversion, and an Opportunity
of indulging her self in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec318.txt')">dear</a> Delight of being admired, addressed
to, and flattered, with no ill Consequence to her Reputation. This
Lady is of a free and disengaged <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec318.txt')">Behaviour</a>, ever in good Humour, such
as is the Image of Innocence with those who are innocent, and an
Encouragement to Vice with those who are abandoned. From this Kind of
Carriage, and an apparent Approbation of his Gallantry, Escalus had
frequent Opportunities of laying amorous Epistles in her Way, of
fixing his Eyes attentively upon her Action, of performing a thousand
little Offices which are neglected by the Unconcerned, but are so many
Approaches towards Happiness with the Enamoured. It was now, as is
above hinted, almost the End of the seventh Year of his Passion, when
Escalus from general Terms, and the ambiguous <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec318.txt')">Respect</a> which criminal
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec318.txt')">Lovers</a> retain in their Addresses, began to bewail that his Passion
grew too violent for him to answer any longer for his Behaviour
towards her; and that he hoped she would have Consideration for his
long and patient Respect, to excuse the Motions of a Heart now no
longer under the Direction of the unhappy Owner of it. Such for some
Months had been the Language of Escalus both in his Talk and his
Letters to Isabella; who returned all the Profusion of kind <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec318.txt')">Things</a>
which had been the Collection of fifty Years with I must not hear you;
you will make me forget that you are a Gentleman, I would not
willingly lose you as a Friend; and the like Expressions, which the
Skilful interpret to their own Advantage, as well knowing that a
feeble Denial is a modest Assent. I should have told you, that
Isabella, during the whole Progress of this Amour, communicated it to
her Husband; and that an Account of Escalus's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec318.txt')">Love</a> was their usual
Entertainment after half a Days <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec318.txt')">Absence</a>: Isabella therefore, upon her
Lovers late more open Assaults, with a Smile told her Husband she
could hold out no longer, but that his Fate was now come to a Crisis.
After she had explained her self a little farther, with her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec318.txt')">Husbands</a>
Approbation she proceeded in the following Manner. The next Time that
Escalus was alone with her, and repeated his Importunity, the crafty
Isabella looked on her Fan with an Air of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec318.txt')">great</a> Attention, as
considering of what Importance such a Secret was to her; and upon the
Repetition of a warm Expression, she looked at him with an Eye of
Fondness, and told him he was past that Time of Life which could make
her fear he would boast of a Lady's Favour; then turned away her Head
with a very well-acted Confusion, which favoured the Escape of the
aged Escalus. This Adventure was Matter of great Pleasantry to
Isabella and her Spouse; and they had enjoyed it two Days before
Escalus could recollect himself enough to form the following Letter.</p><p>
MADAM,</p><p>"What happened the other Day, gives me a lively Image of the
Inconsistency of human Passions and Inclinations. We pursue what we
are denied, and place our Affections on what is absent, tho we
neglected it when present. As long as you refused my Love, your
Refusal did so strongly excite my Passion, that I had not once the
Leisure to think of recalling my Reason to aid me against the Design
upon your Virtue. But when that Virtue began to comply in my Favour,
my Reason made an Effort over my Love, and let me see the Baseness
of my Behaviour in attempting a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec318.txt')">Woman</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec318.txt')">Honour</a>. I own to you, it
was not without the most violent Struggle that I gained this Victory
over my self; nay, I will confess my Shame, and acknowledge I could
not have prevailed but by Flight. However, Madam, I beg that you
will believe a Moments Weakness has not destroyed the Esteem I had
for you, which was confirmed by so many Years of Obstinate Virtue.
You have Reason to rejoice that this did not happen within the
Observation of one of the young Fellows, who would have exposed your
Weakness, and gloried in his own Brutish Inclinations.
I am, Madam,
Your most devoted Humble Servant."</p><p>
Isabella, with the Help of her Husband, returned the following Answer.</p><p>
SIR,</p><p>"I cannot but account my self a very happy Woman, in having a Man
for a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec318.txt')">Lover</a> that can write so well, and give so good a Turn to a
Disappointment. Another Excellence you have above all other
Pretenders I ever heard of; on Occasions where the most reasonable
Men lose all their Reason, you have yours most powerful. We are each
of us to thank our Genius, that the Passion of one abated in
Proportion as that of the other grew violent. Does it not yet come
into your Head, to imagine that I knew my Compliance was the
greatest Cruelty I could be guilty of towards you? In Return for
your long and faithful Passion, I must let you know that you are old
enough to become a little more Gravity; but if you will leave me and
coquet it any where else, may your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec318.txt')">Mistress</a> yield.</p><p>ISABELLA."</p><p>
