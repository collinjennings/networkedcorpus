<p>No. 319.             Thursday, March 6, 1712.                  Budgell.</p><p></p><p>Quo teneam vultus mutantem Protea nodo?</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I have endeavoured, in the Course of my Papers, to do Justice to the
Age, and have taken care as much as possible to keep my self a Neuter
between both Sexes. I have neither spared the <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec319.txt')">Ladies</a> out of
Complaisance, nor the Men out of Partiality; but notwithstanding the
great Integrity with which I have acted in this Particular, I find my
self taxed with an Inclination to favour my own half of the Species.
Whether it be that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec319.txt')">Women</a> afford a more fruitful Field for
Speculation, or whether they run more in my <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec319.txt')">Head</a> than the Men, I cannot
tell, but I shall set down the Charge as it is laid against me in the
following Letter.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I always make one among a Company of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec319.txt')">young</a> Females, who peruse your
Speculations every Morning. I am at <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec319.txt')">present</a> Commissioned, by our whole
Assembly, to let you know, that we fear you are a little enclined to
be partial towards your own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec319.txt')">Sex</a>. We must however acknowledge, with all
due Gratitude, that in some Cases you have given us our Revenge on the
Men, and done us Justice. We could not easily have forgiven you
several Strokes in the Dissection of the Coquets Heart, if you had
not, much about the same time, made a Sacrifice to us of a Beaus
Scull.</p><p>You may, however, Sir, please to remember, that long since you
attacked our Hoods and Commodes in such manner, as, to use your own
Expression, made very many of us ashamed to shew our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec319.txt')">Heads</a>. We must,
therefore, beg leave to represent to you, that we are in Hopes, if you
would please to make a due Enquiry, the Men in all Ages would be found
to have been little less whimsical in adorning that Part, than our
selves. The different Forms of their Wiggs, together with the various
Cocks of their Hats, all flatter us in this Opinion.</p><p>I had an humble Servant last Summer, who the first time he declared
himself, was in a Full-Bottom'd Wigg; but the Day after, to my no
small Surprize, he accosted me in a thin Natural one. I received him,
at this our second Interview, as a perfect Stranger, but was extreamly
confounded, when his Speech discovered who he was. I resolved,
therefore, to fix his Face in my Memory for the future; but as I was
walking in the Park the same Evening, he appeared to me in one of
those Wiggs that I think you call a Night-cap, which had altered him
more effectually than before. He afterwards played a Couple of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec319.txt')">Black</a>
Riding Wiggs upon me, with the same Success; and, in short, assumed a
new Face almost every Day in the first Month of his Courtship.</p><p>I observed afterwards, that the Variety of Cocks into which he
moulded his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec319.txt')">Hat</a>, had not a little contributed to his Impositions upon
me.</p><p>Yet, as if all these ways were not sufficient to distinguish their
Heads, you must, doubtless, Sir, have observed, that great Numbers of
young Fellows have, for several Months last past, taken upon them to
wear Feathers.</p><p>We hope, therefore, that these may, with as much Justice, be called
Indian Princes, as you have styled a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec319.txt')">Woman</a> in a coloured Hood an
Indian Queen; and that you will, in due time, take these airy
Gentlemen into Consideration.</p><p>We the more earnestly beg that you would put a Stop to this Practice,
since it has already lost us one of the most agreeable Members of our
Society, who after having refused several good Estates, and two
Titles, was lured from us last Week by a mixed Feather.</p><p>I am ordered to present you the Respects of our whole Company, and
am, SIR,
Your very humble Servant,
DORINDA.</p><p>Note, The Person wearing the Feather, tho our Friend took him for an
Officer in the Guards, has proved to be [an arrant Linnen-Draper. [1]]</p><p>
I am not now at leisure to give my Opinion upon the Hat and Feather;
however to wipe off the present Imputation, and gratifie my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec319.txt')">Female</a>
Correspondent, I shall here print a Letter which I lately received from
a Man of Mode, who seems to have a very extraordinary Genius in his way.</p><p>
SIR,
I presume I need not inform you, that among Men of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec319.txt')">Dress</a> it is a
common Phrase to say Mr. Such an one has struck a bold Stroke; by
which we understand, that he is the first Man who has had Courage
enough to lead up a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec319.txt')">Fashion</a>. Accordingly, when our Taylors take
Measure of us, they always demand whether we will have a plain Suit,
or strike a bold Stroke. 1 think I may without Vanity say, that I have
struck some of the boldest and most successful Strokes of any Man in
Great Britain. I was the first that struck the Long Pocket about two
Years since: I was likewise the Author of the Frosted Button, which
when I saw the Town came readily into, being resolved to strike while
the Iron was hot, I produced much about the same time the Scallop
Flap, the knotted Cravat, and made a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec319.txt')">fair</a> Push for the Silver-clocked
Stocking.</p><p>A few Months after I brought up the modish Jacket, or the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec319.txt')">Coat</a> with
close Sleeves. I struck this at first in a plain Doily; but that
failing, I struck it a second time in blue Camlet; and repeated the
Stroke in several kinds of Cloth, till at last it took effect. There
are two or three young Fellows at the other End of the Town, who have
always their Eye upon me, and answer me Stroke for Stroke. I was once
so unwary as to mention my Fancy in relation to the new-fashioned
Surtout before one of these Gentlemen, who was disingenuous enough to
steal my Thought, and by that means prevented my intended Stroke.</p><p>I have a Design this Spring to make very considerable Innovations in
the Wastcoat, and have already begun with a Coup dessai upon the
Sleeves, which has succeeded very well.</p><p>I must further inform you, if you will promise to encourage or at
least to connive at me, that it is my Design to strike such a Stroke
the Beginning of the next Month, as shall surprise the whole Town.</p><p>I do not think it prudent to acquaint you with all the Particulars of
my intended Dress; but will only tell you, as a Sample of it, that I
shall very speedily appear at Whites in a Cherry-coloured Hat. I took
this Hint from the Ladies Hoods, which I look upon as the boldest
Stroke that Sex has struck for these hundred Years last past.</p><p>I am, SIR,</p><p>Your most Obedient, most Humble Servant,</p><p>Will. Sprightly.</p><p>
[I have not Time at present to make any Reflections on this Letter, but
must not however omit that having shewn it to WILL. HONEYCOMB, he
desires to be acquainted with the Gentleman who writ it.]</p><p>X.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: only an Ensign in the Train Bands.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
