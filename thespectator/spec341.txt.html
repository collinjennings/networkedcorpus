<p>No. 341.                Tuesday, April 1, 1712.             Budgell. [1]</p><p></p><p>--Revocate animos moestumque timorem Mittite--</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>Having, to oblige my Correspondent Physibulus, printed his Letter last
Friday, in relation to the new Epilogue, he cannot take it amiss, if I
now publish another, which I have just received from a Gentleman who
does not agree with him in his Sentiments upon that Matter.</p><p></p><p>SIR,</p><p>I am amazed to find an Epilogue attacked in your last Fridays Paper,
which has been so generally applauded by the Town, and receiv'd such
Honours as were never before given to any in an <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec341.txt')">English</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec341.txt')">Theatre</a>.</p><p>The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec341.txt')">Audience</a> would not permit Mrs. Oldfield to go off the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec341.txt')">Stage</a> the
first Night, till she had repeated it twice; the second Night the
Noise of Ancoras was as loud as before, and she was again obliged to
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec341.txt')">speak</a> it twice: the third Night it was still called for a second time;
and, in short, contrary to all other Epilogues, which are dropt after
the third Representation of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec341.txt')">Play</a>, this has already been repeated
nine times.</p><p>I must own I am the more surprized to find this Censure in Opposition
to the whole Town, in a Paper which has hitherto been famous for the
Candour of its Criticisms.</p><p>I can by no means allow your melancholy Correspondent, that the new
Epilogue is unnatural because it is gay. If I had a mind to be
learned, I could tell him that the Prologue and Epilogue were real
Parts of the ancient <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec341.txt')">Tragedy</a>; but every one knows that on the British
Stage they are distinct Performances by themselves, Pieces entirely
detached from the Play, and no way essential to it.</p><p>The moment the Play ends, Mrs. Oldfield is no more Andromache, but
Mrs. Oldfield; and tho the Poet had left Andromache stone-dead upon
the Stage, as your ingenious Correspondent phrases it, Mrs. Oldfield
might still have spoke a merry Epilogue. We have an Instance of this
in a Tragedy [2] where there is not only a <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec341.txt')">Death</a> but a Martyrdom. St.
Catherine was there personated by Nell Gwin; she lies stone dead upon
the Stage, but upon those Gentlemen's offering to remove her Body,
whose Business it is to carry off the Slain in our English Tragedies,
she breaks out into that abrupt Beginning of what was a very
ludicrous, but at the same time thought a very good Epilogue.</p><p>Hold, are you mad? you damn'd confounded Dog,
I am to rise and speak the Epilogue.</p><p>This diverting <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec341.txt')">Manner</a> was always practised by Mr. Dryden, who if he
was not the best Writer of Tragedies in his time, was allowed by every
one to have the happiest Turn for a Prologue or an Epilogue. The
Epilogues to Cleomenes, Don Sebastian, The Duke of Guise, Aurengzebe,
and Love Triumphant, are all Precedents of this Nature.</p><p>I might further justify this Practice by that excellent Epilogue which
was spoken a few Years since, after the Tragedy of Ph√¶dra and
Hippolitus; with a great many others, in which the <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec341.txt')">Authors</a> have
endeavour'd to make the Audience merry. If they have not all succeeded
so well as the Writer of this, they have however shewn that it was not
for want of Good-will.</p><p>I must further observe, that the Gaiety of it may be still the more
proper, as it is at the end of a French Play; since every one knows
that Nation, who are generally esteem'd to have as polite a Taste as
any in Europe, always close their Tragick Entertainments with what
they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec341.txt')">call</a> a Petite Piece, which is purposely design'd to raise Mirth,
and send away the Audience well pleased. The same Person who has
supported the chief Character in the Tragedy, very often plays the
principal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec341.txt')">Part</a> in the Petite Piece; so that I have my self seen at
Paris, Orestes and Lubin acted the same Night by the same Man.</p><p>Tragi-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec341.txt')">Comedy</a>, indeed, you have your self in a former Speculation found
fault with very justly, because it breaks the Tide of the Passions
while they are yet flowing; but this is nothing at all to the present
Case, where they have already had their full Course.</p><p>As the new Epilogue is written conformable to the Practice of our best
Poets, so it is not such an one which, as the Duke of Buckingham says
in his Rehearsal, might serve for any other Play; but wholly rises out
of the Occurrences of the Piece it was composed for.</p><p>The only Reason your mournful Correspondent gives against this
Facetious Epilogue, as he calls it, is, that he has mind to go home
melancholy. I wish the Gentleman may not be more Grave than Wise. For
my own part, I must confess I think it very sufficient to have the
Anguish of a fictitious Piece remain upon me while it is representing,
but I love to be sent home to bed in a good humour. If Physibulus is
however resolv'd to be inconsolable, and not to have his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec341.txt')">Tears</a> dried
up, he need only continue his old Custom, and when he has had his half
Crowns worth of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec341.txt')">Sorrow</a>, slink out before the Epilogue begins.</p><p>It is pleasant enough to hear this Tragical <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec341.txt')">Genius</a> complaining of the
great Mischief Andromache had done him: What was that? Why, she made
him laugh. The poor Gentleman's Sufferings put me in mind of
Harlequins Case, who was tickled to Death. He tells us soon after,
thro a small Mistake of Sorrow for Rage, that during the whole Action
he was so very sorry, that he thinks he could have attack'd half a
score of the fiercest Mohocks in the Excess of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec341.txt')">Grief</a>. I cannot but
look upon it as an happy Accident, that a Man who is so bloody-minded
in his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec341.txt')">Affliction</a>, was diverted from this Fit of outragious
Melancholy. The Valour of this Gentleman in his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec341.txt')">Distress</a>, brings to
ones memory the Knight of the sorrowful Countenance, who lays about
him at such an unmerciful rate in an old Romance. I shall readily
grant him that his Soul, as he himself says, would have made a very
ridiculous Figure, had it quitted the Body, and descended to the
Poetical Shades, in such an Encounter.</p><p>As to his Conceit of tacking a Tragic Head with a Comic Tail, in order
to refresh the Audience, it is such a piece of Jargon, that I don't
know what to make of it.</p><p>The elegant Writer makes a very sudden Transition from the Play-house
to the Church, and from thence, to the Gallows.</p><p>As for what relates to the Church, he is of Opinion, that these
Epilogues have given occasion to those merry Jiggs from the Organ-Loft
which have dissipated those good Thoughts, and Dispositions he has
found in himself, and the rest of the Pew, upon the singing of two
Staves cull'd out by the judicious and diligent Clark.</p><p>He fetches his next Thought from Tyburn; and seems very apprehensive
lest there should happen any Innovations in the Tragedies of his
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec341.txt')">Friend</a> Paul Lorrain.</p><p>In the mean time, Sir, this gloomy Writer, who is so mightily
scandaliz'd at a gay Epilogue after a serious Play, speaking of the
Fate of those unhappy Wretches who are condemned to suffer an
ignominious Death by the Justice of our Laws, endeavours to make the
Reader merry on so improper an occasion, by those poor Burlesque
Expressions of Tragical Dramas, and Monthly Performances.</p><p>I am, Sir, with great Respect,
Your most obedient, most humble Servant,</p><p>Philomeides.</p><p>

Addison ascribed to him. Probably it was of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec341.txt')">writing</a>, but transformed
by Addison's corrections.]</p><p>
