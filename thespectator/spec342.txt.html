<p>No. 342.                 Wednesday, April 2, 1712.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>Justitiæ partes sunt non violare homines: Verecundiæ non offendere.</p><p>Tull.</p><p></p><p>As Regard to Decency is a <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec342.txt')">great</a> Rule of Life in general, but more
especially to be consulted by the Female <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec342.txt')">World</a>, I cannot overlook the
following Letter which describes an egregious Offender.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I was this Day looking over your Papers, and reading in that of
December the 6th with great delight, the amiable Grief of Asteria for
the Absence of her <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec342.txt')">Husband</a>, it threw me into a great deal of
Reflection. I cannot say but this arose very much from the
Circumstances of my own Life, who am a Soldier, and expect every Day
to receive Orders; which will oblige me to leave behind me a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec342.txt')">Wife</a> that
is very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec342.txt')">dear</a> to me, and that very deservedly. She is, at present, I am
sure, no way below your Asteria for Conjugal Affection: But I see the
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec342.txt')">Behaviour</a> of some <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec342.txt')">Women</a> so little suited to the Circumstances wherein
my Wife and I shall soon be, that it is with a Reluctance I never knew
before, I am going to my Duty. What puts me to present Pain, is the
Example of a young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec342.txt')">Lady</a>, whose Story you shall have as well as I can
give it you. Hortensius, an Officer of good Rank in her Majesty's
Service, happen'd in a certain Part of England to be brought to a
Country-Gentleman's House, where he was receiv'd with that more than
ordinary Welcome, with which Men of domestick Lives entertain such few
Soldiers whom a military Life, from the variety of Adventures, has not
render'd over-bearing, but humane, easy, and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec342.txt')">agreeable</a>: Hortensius
stay'd here some time, and had easy Access at all hours, as well as
unavoidable <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec342.txt')">Conversation</a> at some parts of the Day with the beautiful
Sylvana, the Gentleman's Daughter. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec342.txt')">People</a> who live in Cities are
wonderfully struck with every little Country Abode they see when they
take the Air; and tis natural to fancy they could live in every neat
Cottage (by which they pass) much happier than in their present
Circumstances. The turbulent way of Life which Hortensius was used to,
made him reflect with much Satisfaction on all the Advantages of a
sweet Retreat one day; and among the rest, you'll think it not
improbable, it might enter into his Thought, that such a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec342.txt')">Woman</a> as
Sylvana would consummate the Happiness. The World is so debauched with
mean Considerations, that Hortensius knew it would be receiv'd as an
Act of Generosity, if he asked for a Woman of the Highest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec342.txt')">Merit</a>,
without further Questions, of a Parent who had nothing to add to her
personal Qualifications. The Wedding was celebrated at her Fathers
House: When that was over, the generous Husband did not proportion his
Provision for her to the Circumstances of her Fortune, but considered
his Wife as his Darling, his Pride, and his Vanity, or rather that it
was in the Woman he had chosen that a Man of Sense could shew Pride or
Vanity with an Excuse, and therefore adorned her with rich Habits and
valuable Jewels. He did not however omit to admonish her that he did
his very utmost in this; that it was an Ostentation he could not but
be guilty of to a Woman he had so much Pleasure in, desiring her to
consider it as such; and begged of her also to take these Matters
rightly, and believe the Gems, the Gowns, the Laces would still become
her better, if her Air and Behaviour was such, that it might appear
she dressed thus rather in Compliance to his Humour that Way, than out
of any Value she her self had for the Trifles. To this Lesson, too
hard for Woman, Hortensius added, that she must be sure to stay with
her Friends in the Country till his Return. As soon as Hortensius
departed, Sylvana saw in her Looking-glass that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec342.txt')">Love</a> he conceiv'd
for her was wholly owing to the Accident of seeing her: and she is
convinced it was only her Misfortune the rest of Mankind had not
beheld her, or Men of much greater Quality and Merit had contended for
one so genteel, tho bred in Obscurity; so very witty, tho never
acquainted with Court or Town. She therefore resolved not to hide so
much Excellence from the World, but without any Regard to the Absence
of the most generous Man alive, she is now the gayest Lady about this
Town, and has shut out the Thoughts of her Husband by a constant
Retinue of the vainest young Fellows this Age has produced: to
entertain whom, she squanders away all Hortensius is able to supply
her with, tho that Supply is purchased with no less Difficulty than
the Hazard of his Life.</p><p>Now, Mr. SPECTATOR, would it not be a Work becoming your Office to
treat this Criminal as she deserve[s]? You should give it the severest
Reflections you can: You should tell Women, that they are more
accountable for Behaviour in Absence than after Death. The Dead are
not dishonour'd by their Levities; the Living may return, and be
laugh'd at by empty Fops, who will not fail to turn into Ridicule the
good Man who is so unseasonable as to be still alive, and come and
spoil good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec342.txt')">Company</a>.</p><p>I am, SIR,
your most Obedient Humble Servant.</p><p>
All Strictness of Behaviour is so unmercifully laugh'd at in our Age,
that the other much worse Extreme is the more common Folly. But let any
Woman consider which of the two Offences an Husband would the more
easily forgive, that of being less entertaining than she could to please
Company, or raising the Desires of the whole Room to his disadvantage;
and she will easily be able to form her Conduct. We have indeed carry'd
Womens Characters too much into publick Life, and you shall see them
now-a-days affect a sort of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec342.txt')">Fame</a>: but I cannot help venturing to
disoblige them for their Service, by telling them, that the utmost of a
Woman's Character is contained in Domestick Life; she is blameable or
praiseworthy according as her Carriage affects the House of her Father
or her Husband. All she has to do in this World, is contain'd within the
Duties of a Daughter, a Sister, a Wife, and a Mother: All these may be
well performed, tho a Lady should not be the very finest Woman at an
Opera or an Assembly. They are likewise consistent with a moderate share
of Wit, a plain Dress, and a modest Air. But when the very Brains of the
Sex are turned, and they place their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec342.txt')">Ambition</a> on Circumstances, wherein
to excel is no addition to what is truly commendable, where can this
end, but, as it frequently does, in their placing all their Industry,
Pleasure and Ambition on <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec342.txt')">things</a>, which will naturally make the
Gratifications of Life last, at best, no longer than Youth and good
Fortune? And when we consider the least ill Consequence, it can be no
less than looking on their own Condition as Years advance, with a
disrelish of Life, and falling into Contempt of their own Persons, or
being the Derision of others. But when they consider themselves as they
ought, no other than an additional Part of the Species, (for their own
Happiness and Comfort, as well as that of those for whom they were born)
their Ambition to excel will be directed accordingly; and they will in
no part of their Lives want Opportunities of being shining Ornaments to
their Fathers, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec342.txt')">Husbands</a>, Brothers, or Children.</p><p>T</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
