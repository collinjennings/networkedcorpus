<p>No. 348.                Wednesday, April 9, 1712.                 Steele.</p><p></p><p>Invidiam placare paras virtute relicta?</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I have not seen you lately at any of the Places where I visit, so
that I am afraid you are wholly unacquainted with what passes among my
part of the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec348.txt')">World</a>, who are, tho I say it, without Controversy, the
most accomplished and best bred of the Town. Give me leave to tell
you, that I am extremely discomposed when I hear Scandal, and am an
utter <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec348.txt')">Enemy</a> to all <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec348.txt')">manner</a> of Detraction, and think it the greatest
Meanness that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec348.txt')">People</a> of Distinction can be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec348.txt')">guilty</a> of: However, it is
hardly possible to come into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec348.txt')">Company</a>, where you do not find them
pulling one another to pieces, and that from no other Provocation but
that of hearing any one commended. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec348.txt')">Merit</a>, both as to Wit and <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec348.txt')">Beauty</a>,
is become no other than the Possession of a few trifling Peoples
Favour, which you cannot possibly arrive at, if you have really any
thing in you that is deserving. What they would bring to pass, is, to
make all Good and Evil consist in Report, and with Whispers, Calumnies
and Impertinencies, to have the Conduct of those Reports. By this
means Innocents are blasted upon their first Appearance in Town; and
there is nothing more required to make a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec348.txt')">young</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec348.txt')">Woman</a> the object of
Envy and Hatred, than to deserve Love and Admiration. This abominable
Endeavour to suppress or lessen every thing that is praise-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec348.txt')">worthy</a>, is
as frequent among the Men as the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec348.txt')">Women</a>. If I can remember what passed
at a Visit last Night, it will serve as an Instance that the Sexes are
equally inclined to Defamation, with equal Malice, with equal
Impotence. Jack Triplett came into my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec348.txt')">Lady</a> Airy's about Eight of [the]
Clock. You know the manner we sit at a Visit, and I need not describe
the Circle; but Mr. Triplett came in, introduced by two Tapers
supported by a spruce Servant, whose Hair is under a Cap till my
Lady's Candles are all lighted up, and the Hour of Ceremony begins: I
say, Jack Triplett came in, and singing (for he is really good
Company) Every Feature, Charming Creature,--he went on, It is a most
unreasonable thing that People cannot go peaceably to see their
Friends, but these Murderers are let loose. Such a Shape! such an Air!
what a Glance was that as her Chariot pass'd by mine--My Lady herself
interrupted him; Pray who is this fine Thing--I warrant, says another,
tis the Creature I was telling your Ladyship of just now. You were
telling of? says Jack; I wish I had been so happy as to have come in
and heard you, for I have not Words to say what she is: But if an
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec348.txt')">agreeable</a> Height, a modest Air, a Virgin <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec348.txt')">Shame</a>, and Impatience of
being beheld, amidst a Blaze of ten thousand Charms--The whole Room
flew out--Oh Mr. Triplett!--When Mrs. Lofty, a known Prude, said she
believed she knew whom the Gentleman meant; but she was indeed, as he
civilly represented her, impatient of being beheld--Then turning to
the Lady next to her--The most unbred Creature you ever saw. Another
pursued the Discourse: As unbred, Madam, as you may think her, she is
extremely bely'd if she is the Novice she appears; she was last Week
at a Ball till two in the Morning; Mr. Triplett knows whether he was
the happy Man that took Care of her home; but--This was followed by
some particular Exception that each Woman in the Room made to some
peculiar Grace or Advantage so that Mr. Triplett was beaten from one
Limb and Feature to another, till he was forced to resign the whole
Woman. In the end I took notice Triplett recorded all this Malice in
his Heart; and saw in his Countenance, and a certain waggish Shrug,
that he design'd to repeat the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec348.txt')">Conversation</a>: I therefore let the
Discourse die, and soon after took an Occasion to commend a certain
Gentleman of my Acquaintance for a Person of singular Modesty,
Courage, Integrity, and withal as a Man of an entertaining
Conversation, to which Advantages he had a Shape and Manner peculiarly
graceful. Mr. Triplett, who is a Woman's Man, seem'd to hear me with
Patience enough commend the Qualities of his Mind: He never heard
indeed but that he was a very honest Man, and no Fool; but for a fine
Gentleman, he must ask Pardon. Upon no other Foundation than this, Mr.
Triplett took occasion to give the Gentleman's Pedigree, by what
Methods some part of the Estate was acquired, how much it was beholden
to a Marriage for the present Circumstances of it: After all, he could
see nothing but a common Man in his Person, his Breeding or
Understanding.</p><p>Thus, Mr. SPECTATOR, this impertinent Humour of diminishing every one
who is produced in Conversation to their Advantage, runs thro the
World; and I am, I confess, so fearful of the Force of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec348.txt')">ill</a> Tongues,
that I have begged of all those who are my Well-wishers never to
commend me, for it will but bring my Frailties into Examination, and I
had rather be unobserved, than conspicuous for disputed Perfections. I
am confident a thousand young People, who would have been Ornaments to
Society, have, from Fear of Scandal, never dared to exert themselves
in the polite Arts of Life. Their Lives have passed away in an odious
Rusticity, in spite of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec348.txt')">great</a> Advantages of Person, Genius and Fortune.
There is a vicious Terror of being blamed in some well-inclin'd
People, and a wicked Pleasure in suppressing them in others; both
which I recommend to your Spectatorial Wisdom to animadvert upon; and
if you can be successful in it, I need not say how much you will
deserve of the Town; but new Toasts will owe to you their Beauty, and
new Wits their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec348.txt')">Fame</a>. I am,
SIR,
Your most Obedient
Humble Servant,
Mary."</p><p>
