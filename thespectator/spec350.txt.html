<p>No. 350.              Friday, April 11, 1712.                   Steele.</p><p></p><p>Ea animi elatio quæ cernitur in periculis, si Justitia vacat
pugnatque pro suis commodis, in vitio est.</p><p>Tull.</p><p></p><p>CAPTAIN SENTREY was last Night at the Club, and produced a Letter from
Ipswich, which his Correspondent desired him to communicate to his
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec350.txt')">Friend</a> the SPECTATOR. It contained an Account of an Engagement between a
French Privateer, commanded by one Dominick Pottiere, and a little
Vessel of that Place laden with Corn, the Master whereof, as I remember,
was one Goodwin. The Englishman  defended himself with incredible
Bravery, and beat off the French, after having been boarded three or
four times. The <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec350.txt')">Enemy</a> still came on with greater Fury, and hoped by his
Number of Men to carry the Prize, till at last the Englishman finding
himself sink apace, and ready to perish, struck: But the Effect which
this singular Gallantry had upon the Captain of the Privateer, was no
other than an unmanly Desire of Vengeance for the Loss he had sustained
in his several Attacks. He told the Ipswich Man in a speaking-Trumpet,
that he would not take him aboard, and that he stayed to see him sink.
The Englishman at the same time observed a Disorder in the Vessel, which
he rightly judged to proceed from the Disdain which the Ships Crew had
of their Captains Inhumanity: With this Hope he went into his Boat, and
approached the Enemy. He was taken in by the Sailors in spite of their
Commander; but though they received him against his Command, they
treated him when he was in the Ship in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec350.txt')">manner</a> he directed. Pottiere
caused his Men to hold Goodwin, while he beat him with a Stick till he
fainted with Loss of Blood, and Rage of Heart: after which he ordered
him into Irons without allowing him any Food, but such as one or two of
the Men stole to him under peril of the like Usage: After having kept
him several Days overwhelmed with the Misery of Stench, Hunger, and
Soreness, he brought him into Calais. The Governour of the Place was
soon acquainted with all that had passed, dismissed Pottiere from his
Charge with Ignominy, and gave Goodwin all the Relief which a Man of
<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec350.txt')">Honour</a> would bestow upon an Enemy barbarously treated, to recover the
Imputation of Cruelty upon his Prince and Country.</p><p>When Mr. SENTREY had read his Letter, full of many other circumstances
which aggravate the Barbarity, he fell into a sort of Criticism upon
Magnanimity and Courage, and argued that they were inseparable; and that
Courage, without regard to Justice and Humanity, was no other than the
Fierceness of a wild Beast. A good and truly bold Spirit, continued he,
is ever actuated by Reason and a Sense of Honour and Duty: The
Affectation of such a Spirit exerts it self in an Impudent Aspect, an
over-bearing Confidence, and a certain Negligence of giving Offence.
This is visible in all the cocking Youths you see about this Town, who
are noisy in Assemblies, unawed by the Presence of wise and virtuous
Men; in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec350.txt')">word</a>, insensible of all the Honours and Decencies of human
Life. A shameless Fellow takes advantage of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec350.txt')">Merit</a> clothed with Modesty
and Magnanimity, and in the Eyes of little <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec350.txt')">People</a> appears sprightly and
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec350.txt')">agreeable</a>; while the Man of Resolution and true Gallantry is overlooked
and disregarded, if not despised. There is a Propriety in all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec350.txt')">things</a>;
and I believe what you Scholars <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec350.txt')">call</a> just and sublime, in opposition to
turgid and bombast Expression, may give you an Idea of what I mean, when
I say Modesty is the certain Indication of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec350.txt')">great</a> Spirit, and Impudence
the Affectation of it. He that writes with Judgment, and never rises
into improper Warmths, manifests the true Force of Genius; in like
manner, he who is quiet and equal in all his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec350.txt')">Behaviour</a>, is supported in
that Deportment by what we may call true Courage. Alas, it is not so
easy a thing to be a brave Man as the unthinking part of Mankind
imagine: To dare, is not all that there is in it. The Privateer we were
just now talking of, had boldness enough to attack his Enemy, but not
Greatness of Mind enough to admire the same Quality exerted by that
Enemy in defending himself. Thus his base and little Mind was wholly
taken up in the sordid regard to the Prize, of which he failed, and the
damage done to his own Vessel; and therefore he used an honest Man, who
defended his own from him, in the Manner as he would a Thief that should
rob him.</p><p>He was equally disappointed, and had not Spirit enough to consider that
one Case would be Laudable and the other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec350.txt')">Criminal</a>. Malice, Rancour,
Hatred, Vengeance, are what tear the Breasts of mean Men in Fight; but
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec350.txt')">Fame</a>, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec350.txt')">Glory</a>, Conquests, Desires of Opportunities to pardon and oblige
their Opposers, are what glow in the Minds of the Gallant. The Captain
ended his Discourse with a Specimen of his Book-Learning; and gave us to
understand that he had read a French Author on the Subject of Justness
in point of Gallantry. I love, said Mr. SENTREY, a Critick who mixes the
Rules of Life with Annotations upon Writers. My Author, added he, in his
Discourse upon Epick Poem, takes occasion to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec350.txt')">speak</a> of the same Quality
of Courage drawn in the two different Characters of Turnus and Æneas: He
makes Courage the chief and greatest Ornament of Turnus; but in Æneas
there are many others which out-shine it, amongst the rest that of
Piety. Turnus is therefore all along painted by the Poet full of
Ostentation, his Language haughty and vain glorious, as placing his
Honour in the Manifestation of his Valour; Æneas speaks little, is slow
to Action; and shows only a sort of defensive Courage. If Equipage and
Address make Turnus appear more couragious than Æneas, Conduct and
Success prove Æneas more valiant than Turnus.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
