<p>No. 353.                  Tuesday, April 15, 1712.              Budgell.</p><p></p><p>--In tenui labor--</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>The Gentleman who obliges the World in general, and me in particular,
with his Thoughts upon <a name="topic23" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec353.txt')">Education</a>, has just sent me the following Letter.</p><p>
SIR,</p><p>I take the Liberty to send you a fourth Letter upon the Education of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec353.txt')">Youth</a>: In my last I gave you my Thoughts about some particular Tasks
which I conceiv'd it might not be amiss to use with their usual
Exercises, in order to give them an early Seasoning of Virtue; I shall
in this propose some others, which I fancy might contribute to give
them a right turn for the World, and enable them to make their way in
it.</p><p>The Design of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec353.txt')">Learning</a> is, as I take it, either to render a Man an
agreeable Companion to himself, and teach him to support Solitude with
Pleasure, or if he is not born to an <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec353.txt')">Estate</a>, to supply that Defect,
and furnish him with the means of acquiring one. A Person who applies
himself to Learning with the first of these Views may be said to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec353.txt')">study</a>
for Ornament, as he who proposes to himself the second, properly
studies for Use. The one does it to raise himself a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec353.txt')">Fortune</a>, the other
to set off that which he is already possessed of. But as far the
greater part of Mankind are included in the latter Class, I shall only
propose some Methods at present for the Service of such who expect to
advance themselves in the World by their Learning: In order to which,
I shall premise, that many more Estates have been acquir'd by little
Accomplishments than by extraordinary ones; those Qualities which make
the greatest Figure in the Eye of the World, not being always the most
useful in themselves, or the most advantageous to their Owners.</p><p>The Posts which require Men of shining and uncommon Parts to discharge
them, are so very few, that many a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec353.txt')">great</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec353.txt')">Genius</a> goes out of the World
without ever having had an opportunity to exert it self; whereas
Persons of ordinary Endowments meet with Occasions fitted to their
Parts and Capacities every day in the common Occurrences of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec353.txt')">Life</a>.</p><p>I am acquainted with two Persons who were formerly <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec353.txt')">School</a>-fellows,[1]
and have been good Friends ever since. One of them was not only
thought an impenetrable Block-head at School, but still maintain'd his
Reputation at the University; the other was the Pride of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec353.txt')">Master</a>,
and the most celebrated Person in the College of which he was a
Member. The Man of Genius is at present buried in a Country Parsonage
of eightscore Pounds a year; while the other, with the bare Abilities
of a common Scrivener, has got an Estate of above an hundred thousand
Pounds.</p><p>I fancy from what I have said it will almost appear a doubtful Case
to many a wealthy Citizen, whether or no he ought to wish his Son
should be a great Genius; but this I am sure of, that nothing is more
absurd than to give a Lad the Education of one, whom Nature has not
favour'd with any particular Marks of Distinction.</p><p>The fault therefore of our Grammar-Schools is, that every Boy is
pushed on to Works of Genius; whereas it would be far more
advantageous for the greatest part of them to be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec353.txt')">taught</a> such little
practical Arts and Sciences as do not require any great share of Parts
to be Master of them, and yet may come often into play during the
course of a Man's Life.</p><p>Such are all the Parts of Practical Geometry. I have known a Man
contract a Friendship with a Minister of State, upon cutting a Dial in
his Window; and remember a Clergyman who got one of the best Benefices
in the West of <a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec353.txt')">England</a>, by setting a Country Gentleman's Affairs in
some Method, and giving him an exact Survey of his Estate.</p><p>While I am upon this Subject, I cannot forbear mentioning a
Particular which is of use in every Station of Life, and which
methinks every Master should teach his Scholars. I mean the writing of
English Letters. To this End, instead of perplexing them with Latin
Epistles, Themes and Verses, there might be a punctual Correspondence
established between two Boys, who might act in any imaginary Parts of
Business, or be allow'd sometimes to give a range to their own Fancies,
and communicate to each other whatever Trifles they thought fit,
provided neither of them ever fail'd at the appointed time to answer
his Correspondents Letter.</p><p>I believe I may venture to affirm, that the generality of Boys would
find themselves more advantaged by this Custom, when they come to be
Men, than by all the Greek and Latin their Masters can teach them in
seven or eight Years.</p><p>The want of it is very visible in many learned Persons, who, while
they are admiring the Styles of Demosthenes or Cicero, want Phrases to
express themselves on the most common Occasions. I have seen a Letter
from one of these Latin Orators, which would have been deservedly
laugh'd at by a common Attorney.</p><p>Under this Head of Writing I cannot omit Accounts and Short-hand,
which are learned with little pains, and very properly come into the
number of such Arts as I have been here recommending.</p><p>You must doubtless, Sir, observe that I have hitherto chiefly insisted
upon these things for such Boys as do not appear to have any thing
extraordinary in their natural Talents, and consequently are not
qualified for the finer Parts of Learning; yet I believe I might carry
this Matter still further, and venture to assert that a Lad of Genius
has sometimes occasion for these little Acquirements, to be as it were
the forerunners of his Parts, and to introduce [him [2]] into the
World.</p><p>History is full of Examples of Persons, who tho they have had the
largest Abilities, have been obliged to insinuate themselves into the
Favour of great Men by these trivial Accomplishments; as the compleat
Gentleman, in some of our modern Comedies, makes his first Advances to
his Mistress under the disguise of a Painter or a Dancing-Master.</p><p>The Difference is, that in a Lad of Genius these are only so many
Accomplishments, which in another are Essentials; the one diverts
himself with them, the other works at them. In short, I look upon a
great Genius, with these little Additions, in the same Light as I
regard the Grand Signior, who is obliged, by an express Command in the
Alcoran, to learn and practise some Handycraft Trade. Tho I need not
have gone for my Instance farther than Germany, where several Emperors
have voluntarily done the same thing. Leopold the last [3], worked in
Wood; and I have heard there are several handycraft Works of his
making to be seen at Vienna so neatly turned, that the best Joiner in
Europe might safely own them, without any disgrace to his Profession.</p><p>I would not be thought, by any thing I have said, to be against
improving a Boys Genius to the utmost pitch it can be carried. What I
would endeavour to shew in this Essay is, that there may be Methods
taken, to make Learning advantageous even to the meanest Capacities.</p><p>I am, SIR, Yours, &c.</p><p>

Hamburgh merchant.</p><p>Stratford is worth a plumb, and is now lending the Government
Â£40,000; yet we were educated together at the same school and
university.</p><p>Journal to Stella, Sept. 14, 1710.]</p><p>

[Footnote 3: Leopold the last was also Leopold the First. He died May 6,
1705, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Joseph, who died while the
Spectator was being issued, and had now been followed by his brother,
the Archduke <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec353.txt')">Charles</a>, whose claim to the crown of Spain England had been
supporting, when his accession to the German throne had not seemed
probable. His coronation as Charles VI. was, therefore, one cause of the
peace. Leopold, born in 1640, and educated by the Jesuits, became
Emperor in 1658, and reigned 49 years. He was an adept in metaphysics
and theology, as well as in wood-turning, but a feeble and oppressive
ruler, whose empire was twice saved for him; by Sobiesld from the Turks,
and from the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec353.txt')">French</a> by Marlborough.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
