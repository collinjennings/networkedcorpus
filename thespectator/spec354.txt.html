<p>No. 354.              Wednesday, April 16, 1712.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>--Cum magnis virtutibus affers
Grande supercilium--</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>You have in some of your Discourses describ'd most sorts of Women in
their distinct and proper Classes, as the Ape, the Coquet, and many
others; but I think you have never yet said anything of a Devotée. A
Devotée is one of those who disparage Religion by their indiscreet and
unseasonable introduction of the Mention of Virtue on all Occasion[s]:
She professes she is what nobody ought to doubt she is; and betrays
the Labour she is put to, to be what she ought to be with Chearfulness
and Alacrity. She lives in the World, and denies her self none of the
Diversions of it, with a constant Declaration how insipid all things
in it are to her. She is never her self but at Church; there she
displays her Virtue, and is so fervent in her Devotions, that I have
frequently seen her Pray her self out of Breath. While other young
Ladies in the House are dancing, or playing at Questions and Commands,
she reads aloud in her Closet. She says all Love is ridiculous, except
it be Celestial; but she speaks of the Passion of one Mortal to
another with too much Bitterness, for one that had no Jealousy mixed
with her Contempt of it. If at any time she sees a Man warm in his
Addresses to his Mistress, she will lift up her Eyes to Heaven, and
cry, What Nonsense is that Fool talking? Will the Bell never ring for
Prayers? We have an eminent Lady of this Stamp in our Country, who
pretends to Amusements very much above the rest of her Sex. She never
carries a white Shock-dog with Bells under her Arm, nor a Squirrel or
Dormouse in her Pocket, but always an abridg'd Piece of Morality to
steal out when she is sure of being observ'd. When she went to the
famous Ass-Race (which I must confess was but an odd Diversion to be
encouraged by <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec354.txt')">People</a> of Rank and Figure) it was not, like other
Ladies, to hear those poor Animals bray, nor to see Fellows run naked,
or to hear Country Squires in bob Wigs and white Girdles make love at
the side of a Coach, and cry, Madam, this is dainty Weather. Thus she
described the Diversion; for she went only to pray heartily that no
body might be hurt in the Crowd, and to see if the poor Fellows Face,
which was distorted with grinning, might any way be brought to it self
again. She never chats over her Tea, but covers her Face, and is
supposed in an Ejaculation before she taste[s] a Sup. This
ostentatious <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec354.txt')">Behaviour</a> is such an Offence to true Sanctity, that it
disparages it, and makes Virtue not only unamiable, but also
ridiculous. The Sacred Writings are full of Reflections which abhor
this kind of Conduct; and a Devotée is so far from promoting Goodness,
that she deters others by her Example. Folly and Vanity in one of
these Ladies, is like Vice in a Clergyman; it does not only debase
him, but makes the inconsiderate Part of the World think the worse of
Religion.</p><p>I am, SIR,</p><p>Your Humble Servant,</p><p>Hotspur.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>Xenophon, in his short Account of the Spartan Commonwealth, [1]
speaking of the Behavior of their young Men in the Streets, says,
There was so much Modesty in their Looks, that you might as soon have
turned the eyes of a Marble Statue upon you as theirs; and that in all
their Behaviour they were more modest than a Bride when put to bed
upon her Wedding-Night: This Virtue, which is always join'd to
Magnanimity, had such an influence upon their Courage, that in Battel
an Enemy could not look them in the Face, and they durst not but Die
for their Country.</p><p>Whenever I walk into the Streets of London and Westminster, the
Countenances of all the young Fellows that pass by me, make me wish my
self in Sparta; I meet with such blustering Airs, big Looks, and bold
Fronts, that to a superficial Observer would bespeak a Courage above
those Grecians. I am arrived to that Perfection in Speculation, that I
understand the Language of the Eyes, which would be a great misfortune
to me, had I not corrected the Testiness of old Age by Philosophy.
There is scarce a Man in a red <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec354.txt')">Coat</a> who does not tell me, with a full
Stare, he's a bold Man: I see several swear inwardly at me, without
any Offence of mine, but the Oddness of my Person: I meet Contempt in
every Street, express'd in different Manners, by the scornful Look,
the elevated Eye-brow, and the swelling Nostrils of the Proud and
Prosperous. The Prentice speaks his Disrespect by an extended Finger,
and the Porter by stealing out his Tongue. If a Country Gentleman
appears a little curious in observing the Edifices, Signs, Clocks,
Coaches, and Dials, it is not to be imagined how the Polite Rabble of
this Town, who are acquainted with these Objects, <a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec354.txt')">ridicule</a> his
Rusticity. I have known a Fellow with a Burden on his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec354.txt')">Head</a> steal a
Hand down from his Load, and slily twirle the Cock of a Squires <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec354.txt')">Hat</a>
behind him; while the Offended Person is swearing, or out of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec354.txt')">Countenance</a>, all the Wagg-Wits in the High-way are grinning in
applause of the ingenious Rogue that gave him the Tip, and the Folly
of him who had not Eyes all round his Head to prevent receiving it.
These things arise from a general Affectation of Smartness, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec354.txt')">Wit</a>, and
Courage. Wycherly somewhere [2] rallies the Pretensions this Way, by
making a Fellow say, Red Breeches are a certain Sign of Valour; and
Otway makes a Man, to boast his Agility, trip up a Beggar on Crutches
[3]. From such Hints I beg a Speculation on this Subject; in the mean
time I shall do all in the Power of a weak old Fellow in my own
Defence: for as Diogenes, being in quest of an honest Man, sought for
him when it was broad Day-light with a Lanthorn and Candle, so I
intend for the future to walk the Streets with a dark Lanthorn, which
has a convex Chrystal in it; and if any Man stares at me, I give fair
Warning that Ill direct the Light full into his Eyes. Thus despairing
to find Men Modest, I hope by this Means to evade their Impudence,
I am, SIR,
Your most humble Servant,
Sophrosunius.</p><p>
T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1:  The Polity of Lacedæmon and the Polity of Athens were
two of Xenophons short treatises. In the Polity of Lacedæmon the
Spartan code of law and social discipline is, as Mr. Mure says in his
Critical History of the Language and Literature of Ancient Greece,</p><p>indiscriminately held up to admiration as superior in all respects to
all others. Some of its more offensive features, such as the Cryptia,
child murder, and more glaring atrocities of the Helot system, are
suppressed; while the legalized thieving, adultery, and other
unnatural practices, are placed in the most favourable or least odious
light.]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: In the Plain Dealer, Act II. sc. I.</p><p>Novel (a pert railing coxcomb). These sea captains make nothing of
dressing. But let me tell you, sir, a man by his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec354.txt')">dress</a>, as much
as by anything, shows his wit and judgment; nay, and his
courage too.</p><p>Freeman. How, his courage, Mr. Novel?</p><p>Novel.   Why, for example, by red breeches, tucked-up hair, or peruke, a
greasy broad belt, and now-a-days a short sword.]</p><p>
[Footnote 3: In his Friendship in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec354.txt')">Fashion</a>, Act III. sc. i</p><p>Malagene.  I tell you what I did tother Day: Faith't is as good a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec354.txt')">Jest</a>
as ever you heard.</p><p>Valentine. Pray, sir, do.</p><p>Mal.       Why, walking alone, a lame Fellow follow'd me and ask'd my
Charity (which by the way was a pretty Proposition to me).
Being in one of my witty, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec354.txt')">merry</a> Fits, I ask'd him how long he
had been in that Condition? The poor Fellow shook his Head,
and told me he was born so. But how dye think I served him?</p><p>Val.       Nay, the Devil knows.</p><p>Mal.       I show'd my Parts, I think; for I tripp'd up both his Wooden
Legs, and walk'd off gravely about my Business.</p><p>Truman.    And this you say is your way of Wit?</p><p>Mal.       Ay, altogether, this and Mimickry. I'm a very good Mimick; I
can act Punchinello, Scaramoucho, Harlequin, Prince
Prettyman, or anything. I can act the rumbling of a
Wheel-barrow.</p><p>Val.       The rumbling of a Wheelbarrow!</p><p>Mal.       Ay, the rumbling of a Wheelbarrow, so I say. Nay, more than
that, I can act a Sow and Pigs, Sausages a broiling, a
Shoulder of Mutton a roasting: I can act a Fly in a
Honey-pot.</p><p>Trum.      That indeed must be the effect of very curious Observation.</p><p>Mal.       No, hang it, I never make it my Business to observe anything,
that is Mechanick.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
