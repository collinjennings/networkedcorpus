<p>No. 36.               Wednesday, April 11, 1711.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>'... Immania monstra
Perferimus ...'</p><p>Virg.</p><p>
I shall not put my self to any further Pains for this Day's
Entertainment, than barely to publish the Letters and Titles of
Petitions from the <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec36.txt')">Play</a>-<a name="topic47" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec36.txt')">house</a>, with the Minutes I have made upon the
Latter for my Conduct in relation to them.</p><p>
Drury-Lane, April [1] the 9th.</p><p>'Upon reading the Project which is set forth in one of your late
Papers, [2] of making an Alliance between all the Bulls, Bears,
Elephants, and Lions, which are separately exposed to publick View in
the Cities of _London_ and _Westminster_; together with the other
Wonders, Shows, and Monsters, whereof you made respective Mention in
the said Speculation; We, the chief <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec36.txt')">Actors</a> of this Playhouse, met and
sat upon the said Design. It is with <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec36.txt')">great</a> Delight that We expect the
Execution of this Work; and in order to contribute to it, We have
given Warning to all our Ghosts to get their Livelihoods where they
can, and not to appear among us after Day-break of the 16th Instant.
We are resolved to take this Opportunity to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec36.txt')">part</a> with every thing
which does not contribute to the Representation of humane Life; and
shall make a free Gift of all animated Utensils to your Projector. The
Hangings you formerly mentioned are run away; as are likewise a Set of
Chairs, each of which was met upon two Legs going through the _Rose_
Tavern at Two this Morning. We hope, Sir, you will give proper Notice
to the Town that we are endeavouring at these Regulations; and that we
intend for the future to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec36.txt')">show</a> no Monsters, but Men who are converted
into such by their own Industry and Affectation. If you will please to
be at the House to-night, you will see me do my Endeavour to show some
unnatural Appearances which are in vogue among the Polite and
Well-bred. I am to represent, in the Character of a fine Lady Dancing,
all the Distortions which are frequently taken for Graces in Mien and
Gesture. This, Sir, is a Specimen of the Method we shall take to
expose the Monsters which come within the Notice of a regular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec36.txt')">Theatre</a>;
and we desire nothing more gross may be admitted by you Spectators for
the future. We have cashiered three Companies of Theatrical Guards,
and design our Kings shall for the future make Love and sit in Council
without an Army: and wait only your Direction, whether you will have
them reinforce King _Porus_ or join the Troops of _Macedon_. Mr.
_Penkethman_ resolves to consult his _Pantheon_ of Heathen Gods in
Opposition to the Oracle of _Delphos_, and doubts not but he shall
turn the Fortunes of _Porus_ when he personates him. I am desired by
the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec36.txt')">Company</a> to inform you, that they submit to your Censures; and
shall have you in greater Veneration than _Hercules_ was in of old, if
you can drive Monsters from the Theatre; and think your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec36.txt')">Merit</a> will be
as much greater than his, as to convince is more than to conquer.</p><p>I am, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, T.D.</p><p>
SIR, When I acquaint you with the great and unexpected Vicissitudes of
my Fortune, I doubt not but I shall obtain your Pity and Favour. I
have for many Years last past been Thunderer to the Play-house; and
have not only made as much Noise out of the Clouds as any Predecessor
of mine in the Theatre that ever bore that Character, but also have
descended and spoke on the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec36.txt')">Stage</a> as the bold Thunder in _The
Rehearsal_ [1]</p><p>When they got me down thus low, they thought fit to degrade me
further, and make me a Ghost. I was contented with this for these two
last Winters; but they carry their Tyranny still further, and not
satisfied that I am banished from above Ground, they have given me to
understand that I am wholly to depart their Dominions, and taken from
me even my subterraneous Employment. Now, Sir, what I desire of you
is, that if your Undertaker thinks fit to use Fire-Arms (as other
Authors have done) in the Time of _Alexander_, I may be a Cannon
against _Porus_, or else provide for me in the Burning of
_Persepolis_, or what other Method you shall think fit.</p><p>Salmoneus of Covent-Garden.'</p><p>
The Petition of all the Devils of the Play-house in behalf of themselves
and Families, setting forth their Expulsion from thence, with
Certificates of their good Life and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec36.txt')">Conversation</a>, and praying Relief.</p><p>_The Merit of this Petition referred to Mr._ Chr. Rich, _who made them
Devils._</p><p>The Petition of the Grave-digger in 'Hamlet', to command the Pioneers in
the Expedition of _Alexander_.</p><p>_Granted._</p><p>The Petition of _William Bullock_, to be _Hephestion_ to _Penkethman the
Great_. [4]</p><p>_Granted._</p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p>The caricature here, and in following lines, is of a passage in Sir
Robert Stapylton's 'Slighted Maid': 'I am the Evening, dark as
Night,' &c.</p><p>In the 'Spectator's' time the Rehearsal was an acted play, in which
Penkethman had the part of the gentleman Usher, and Bullock was one
of the two Kings of Brentford; Thunder was Johnson, who played also
the Grave-digger in Hamlet and other reputable parts.</p><p>
*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: 'March' was written by an oversight left in the first reprint
uncorrected.]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: No. 31.]</p><p>
[Footnote 3: Mr. Bayes, the poet, in the Duke of Buckingham's
'Rehearsal', after showing how he has planned a Thunder and Lightning
Prologue for his play, says,</p><p>Come out, Thunder and Lightning.</p><p>[Enter Thunder and Lightning.]</p><p>'Thun'.     I am the bold 'Thunder'.</p><p>'Bayes'.    Mr. Cartwright, prithee <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec36.txt')">speak</a> that a little louder, and
with a hoarse <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec36.txt')">voice</a>. I am the bold Thunder: pshaw! Speak
it me in a voice that thunders it out indeed: I am the
bold 'Thunder'.</p><p>'Thun'.     I am the bold 'Thunder'.</p><p>'Light'.    The brisk Lightning, I.']</p><p>
[Footnote 4: William Bullock was a good and popular comedian, whom some
preferred to Penkethman, because he spoke no more than was set down for
him, and did not overact his parts. He was now with Penkethman, now with
Cibber and others, joint-manager of a theatrical booth at Bartholomew
Fair. When this essay was written Bullock and Penkethman were acting
together in a play called 'Injured Love', produced at Drury Lane on the
7th of April, Bullock as 'Sir Bookish Outside,' Penkethman as 'Tipple,'
a Servant. Penkethman, Bullock and Dogget were in those days Macbeth's
three witches. Bullock had a son on the stage capable of courtly parts,
who really had played Hephestion in 'the Rival Queens', in a theatre
opened by Penkethman at Greenwich in the preceding summer.]</p><p></p><p>

_A Widow Gentlewoman, wellborn both by Father and Mother's Side,
being the Daughter of_ Thomas Prater, _once an eminent
Practitioner in the Law, and of_ Letitia Tattle, _a Family well
known in all Parts of this Kingdom, having been reduc'd by
Misfortunes to wait on several great Persons, and for some time to
be Teacher at a Boarding-School of young Ladies; giveth Notice to
the Publick, That she hath lately taken a House near_ Bloomsbury-
Square, _commodiously situated next the Fields in a good Air;
where she teaches all sorts of Birds of the loquacious Kinds, as
Parrots, Starlings, Magpies, and others, to imitate human Voices
in greater Perfection than ever yet was practis'd. They are not
only instructed to pronounce Words distinctly, and in a proper
Tone and Accent, but to speak the Language with great Purity and
Volubility of Tongue, together with all the fashionable Phrases
and Compliments now in use either at Tea-Tables or visiting Days.
Those that have good Voices may be taught to sing the newest
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec36.txt')">Opera</a>-Airs, and, if requir'd, to speak either_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec36.txt')">Italian</a> _or_
French, _paying something extraordinary above the common Rates.
They whose Friends are not able to pay the full Prices may be
taken as Half-boarders. She teaches such as are design'd for the
Diversion of the Publick, and to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec36.txt')">act</a> in enchanted Woods on the
Theatres, by the Great. As she has often observ'd with much
Concern how indecent an Education is usually given these innocent
Creatures, which in some Measure is owing to their being plac'd in
Rooms next the Street, where, to the great Offence of chaste and
tender Ears, they learn Ribaldry, obscene Songs, and immodest
Expressions from Passengers and idle <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec36.txt')">People</a>, and also to cry Fish
and Card-matches, with other useless Parts of Learning to Birds
who have rich Friends, she has fitted up proper and neat
Apartments for them in the back Part of her said House; where she
suffers none to approach them but her self, and a Servant Maid who
is deaf and dumb, and whom she provided on purpose to prepare
their Food and cleanse their Cages; having found by long
Experience how hard a thing it is for those to keep Silence who
have the Use of Speech, and the Dangers her Scholars are expos'd
to by the strong Impressions that are made by harsh Sounds and
vulgar Dialects. In short, if they are Birds of any Parts or
Capacity, she will undertake to render them so accomplish'd in the
Compass of a Twelve-month, that they shall be fit Conversation for
such Ladies as love to chuse their Friends and Companions out of
this Species_.</p><p>R.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
