<p>No. 361.                 Thursday, April 24, 1712.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>Tartaream intendit vocem, qu√¢ protinus omnis
Contremuit domus--</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>I have lately received the following Letter from a Country Gentleman.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>The Night before I left London I went to see a <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec361.txt')">Play</a>, called The
Humorous Lieutenant. [1] Upon the Rising of the Curtain I was very
much surprized with the great Consort of <a name="topic47" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec361.txt')">Cat</a>-calls which was exhibited
that Evening, and began to think with myself that I had made a
Mistake, and gone to a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec361.txt')">Musick</a>-Meeting, instead of the Play-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec361.txt')">house</a>. It
appeared indeed a little odd to me to see so many Persons of Quality
of both Sexes assembled together at a kind of Catterwawling; for I
cannot look upon that Performance to have been any thing better,
whatever the Musicians themselves might think of it. As I had no
Acquaintance in the House to ask Questions of, and was forced to go
out of Town early the next Morning, I could not learn the Secret of
this Matter. What I would therefore desire of you, is, to give some
account of this strange Instrument, which I found the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec361.txt')">Company</a> called a
Cat-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec361.txt')">call</a>; and particularly to let me know whether it be a piece of
Musick lately come from Italy. For my own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec361.txt')">part</a>, to be free with you, I
would rather hear an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec361.txt')">English</a> Fiddle; though I durst not shew my
Dislike whilst I was in the Play-House, it being my Chance to sit the
very next Man to one of the Performers. I am, SIR,</p><p>Your most affectionate <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec361.txt')">Friend</a>
and Servant,
John Shallow, Esq.</p><p>
In compliance with Esquire Shallows Request, I design this Paper as a
Dissertation upon the Cat-call. In order to make myself a Master of the
Subject, I purchased one the Beginning of last Week, though not without
great difficulty, being informd at two or three Toyshops that the
Players had lately bought them all up. I have since consulted many
learned Antiquaries in relation to its Original, and find them very much
divided among themselves upon that Particular. A Fellow of the Royal
Society, who is my good Friend, and a great Proficient in the
Mathematical Part of Musick, concludes from the Simplicity of its Make,
and the Uniformity of its Sound, that the Cat-call is older than any of
the Inventions of Jubal. He observes very well, that Musical Instruments
took their first Rise from the Notes of Birds, and other melodious
Animals; and what, says he, was more natural than for the first Ages of
Mankind to imitate the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec361.txt')">Voice</a> of a Cat that lived under the same Roof
with them? He added, that the Cat had contributed more to Harmony than
any other Animal; as we are not only beholden to her for this
Wind-Instrument, but for our String Musick in general.</p><p>Another Virtuoso of my Acquaintance will not allow the Cat-call to be
older than Thespis, and is apt to think it appeared in the World soon
after the antient <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec361.txt')">Comedy</a>; for which reason it has still a place in our
Dramatick Entertainments: Nor must I here omit what a very curious
Gentleman, who is lately returned from his Travels, has more than once
assured me, namely that there was lately dug up at Rome the Statue of
Momus, who holds an Instrument in his Right-Hand very much resembling
our Modern Cat-call.</p><p>There are others who ascribe this Invention to Orpheus, and look upon
the Cat-call to be one of those Instruments which that famous Musician
made use of to draw the Beasts about him. It is certain, that the
Roasting of a Cat does not call together a greater <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec361.txt')">Audience</a> of that
Species than this Instrument, if dexterously played upon in proper Time
and Place.</p><p>But notwithstanding these various and learned Conjectures, I cannot
forbear thinking that the Cat-call is originally a Piece of English
Musick. Its Resemblance to the Voice of some of our British Songsters,
as well as the Use of it, which is peculiar to our Nation, confirms me
in this Opinion. It has at least received great Improvements among us,
whether we consider the Instrument it self, or those several Quavers and
Graces which are thrown into the playing of it. Every one might be
sensible of this, who heard that remarkable overgrown Cat-call which was
placed in the Center of the Pit, and presided over all the rest at [the
[2]] celebrated Performance lately exhibited in Drury-Lane.</p><p>Having said thus much concerning the Original of the Cat-call, we are in
the next place to consider the Use of it. The Cat-call exerts it self to
most advantage in the British <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec361.txt')">Theatre</a>: It very much Improves the Sound
of Nonsense, and often goes along with the Voice of the Actor who
pronounces it, as the Violin or Harpsichord accompanies the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec361.txt')">Italian</a>
Recitativo.</p><p>It has often supplied the Place of the antient Chorus, in the Works of
Mr.----In short, a bad Poet has as great an Antipathy to a Cat-call, as
many <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec361.txt')">People</a> have to a real Cat.</p><p>Mr. Collier, in his ingenious Essay upon Musick [3] has the following
Passage:</p><p>I believe tis possible to invent an Instrument that shall have a
quite contrary Effect to those Martial ones now in use: An Instrument
that shall sink the Spirits, and shake the Nerves, and curdle the
Blood, and inspire Despair, and Cowardice and Consternation, at a
surprizing rate. Tis probable the Roaring of Lions, the Warbling of
Cats and Scritch-Owls, together with a Mixture of the Howling of Dogs,
judiciously imitated and compounded, might go a great way in this
Invention. Whether such Anti-Musick as this might not be of Service in
a Camp, I shall leave to the Military Men to consider.</p><p>What this learned Gentleman supposes in Speculation, I have known
actually verified in Practice. The Cat-call has struck a Damp into
Generals, and frighted Heroes off the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec361.txt')">Stage</a>. At the first sound of it I
have seen a Crowned Head tremble, and a Princess fall into Fits. The
Humorous Lieutenant himself could not stand it; nay, I am told that even
Almanzor looked like a Mouse, and trembled at the Voice of this
terrifying Instrument.</p><p>As it is of a Dramatick Nature, and peculiarly appropriated to the
Stage, I can by no means approve the Thought of that angry Lover, who,
after an unsuccessful Pursuit of some Years, took leave of his Mistress
in a Serenade of Cat-calls.</p><p>I must conclude this Paper with the Account I have lately received of an
ingenious Artist, who has long studied this Instrument, and is very well
versed in all the Rules of the Drama. He teaches to play on it by Book,
and to express by it the whole Art of Criticism. He has his Base and his
Treble Cat-call; the former for <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec361.txt')">Tragedy</a>, the latter for Comedy; only in
Tragy-Comedies they may both play together in Consort. He has a
particular Squeak to denote the Violation of each of the Unities, and
has different Sounds to shew whether he aims at the Poet or the Player.
In short he teaches the Smut-note, the Fustian-note, the Stupid-note,
and has composed a kind of Air that may serve as an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec361.txt')">Act</a>-tune to an
incorrigible Play, and which takes in the whole Compass of the Cat-call.</p><p>[L. [4]]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: By Beaumont and Fletcher.]</p><p>
