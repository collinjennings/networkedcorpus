<p>No. 362.             Friday, April 25, 1712.                   Steele.</p><p></p><p>Laudibus arguitur Vini vinosus--</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Temple, Apr. 24.</p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>Several of my Friends were this Morning got together over a Dish of
Tea in very good Health, though we had celebrated Yesterday with more
Glasses than we could have dispensed with, had we not been beholden to
Brooke and Hillier. In Gratitude therefore to those good Citizens, I
am, in the Name of the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec362.txt')">Company</a>, to accuse you of <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec362.txt')">great</a> Negligence in
overlooking their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec362.txt')">Merit</a>, who have imported true and generous <a name="topic46" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec362.txt')">Wine</a>, and
taken care that it should not be adulterated by the Retailers before
it comes to the Tables of private Families, or the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec362.txt')">Clubs</a> of honest
Fellows. I cannot imagine how a SPECTATOR can be supposed to do his
Duty, without frequent Resumption of such Subjects as concern our
Health, the first thing to be regarded, if we have a mind to relish
anything else. It would therefore very well become your Spectatorial
Vigilance, to give it in Orders to your Officer for inspecting Signs,
that in his March he would look into the Itinerants who deal in
Provisions, and enquire where they buy their several Wares. Ever since
the Decease of [Cully [1]]- Mully-Puff [2] of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec362.txt')">agreeable</a> and noisy
Memory, I cannot say I have observed any thing sold in Carts, or
carried by Horse or Ass, or in fine, in any moving Market, which is
not perished or putrified; witness the Wheel-barrows of rotten
Raisins, Almonds, Figs, and Currants, which you see vended by a
<a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec362.txt')">Merchant</a> dressed in a second-hand Suit of a Foot Soldier. You should
consider that a Child may be poisoned for the Worth of a Farthing; but
except his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec362.txt')">poor</a> Parents send to one certain Doctor in Town, [3] they
can have no advice for him under a Guinea. When Poisons are thus
cheap, and Medicines thus dear, how can you be negligent in inspecting
what we eat and drink, or take no Notice of such as the
above-mentioned Citizens, who have been so serviceable to us of late
in that particular? It was a Custom among the old Romans, to do him
particular Honours who had saved the Life of a Citizen, how much more
does the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec362.txt')">World</a> owe to those who prevent the Death of Multitudes? As
these Men deserve well of your Office, so such as act to the Detriment
of our Health, you ought to represent to themselves and their
Fellow-Subjects in the Colours which they deserve to wear. I think it
would be for the publick Good, that all who vend Wines should be under
oaths in that behalf. The Chairman at a Quarter Sessions should inform
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec362.txt')">Country</a>, that the Vintner who mixes Wine to his Customers, shall
(upon proof that the Drinker thereof died within a Year and a Day
after taking it) be deemed guilty of Wilful Murder: and the Jury shall
be instructed to enquire and present such Delinquents accordingly. It
is no Mitigation of the Crime, nor will it be conceived that it can be
brought in Chance-Medley or Man-Slaughter, upon Proof that it shall
appear Wine joined to Wine, or right Herefordshire poured into Port O
Port; but his selling it for one thing, knowing it to be another, must
justly bear the foresaid Guilt of wilful Murder: For that he, the said
Vintner, did an unlawful Act willingly in the false Mixture; and is
therefore with Equity liable to all the Pains to which a Man would be,
if it were proved he designed only to run a Man through the Arm, whom
he whipped through the Lungs. This is my third Year at the Temple, and
this is or should be Law. An ill Intention well proved should meet
with no Alleviation, because it [out-ran [4]] it self. There cannot be
too great Severity used against the Injustice as well as Cruelty of
those who play with Mens Lives, by preparing Liquors, whose Nature,
for ought they know, may be noxious when mixed, tho innocent when
apart: And Brooke and Hillier, [5] who have ensured our Safety at our
Meals, and driven Jealousy from our Cups in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec362.txt')">Conversation</a>, deserve the
Custom and Thanks of the whole Town; and it is your Duty to remind
them of the Obligation. I am, SIR,
Your Humble Servant,
Tom. Pottle.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a Person who was long immured in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec362.txt')">College</a>, read much, saw
little; so that I knew no more of the World than what a Lecture or a
View of the Map taught me. By this means I improved in my Study, but
became unpleasant in Conversation. By conversing generally with the
Dead, I grew almost unfit for the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec362.txt')">Society</a> of the Living; so by a long
Confinement I contracted an ungainly Aversion to Conversation, and
ever discoursed with Pain to my self, and little Entertainment to
others. At last I was in some measure made sensible of my failing, and
the Mortification of never being spoke to, or speaking, unless the
Discourse ran upon Books, put me upon forcing my self amongst Men. I
immediately affected the politest Company, by the frequent use of
which I hoped to wear off the Rust I had contracted; but by an uncouth
Imitation of Men used to act in publick, I got no further than to
discover I had a Mind to appear a finer thing than I really was.</p><p>Such I was, and such was my Condition, when I became an ardent <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec362.txt')">Lover</a>,
and passionate Admirer of the beauteous Belinda: Then it was that I
really began to improve. This <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec362.txt')">Passion</a> changed all my Fears and
Diffidences in my general <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec362.txt')">Behaviour</a>, to the sole Concern of pleasing
her. I had not now to study the Action of a Gentleman, but <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec362.txt')">Love</a>
possessing all my Thoughts, made me truly be the thing I had a Mind to
appear. My Thoughts grew free and generous, and the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec362.txt')">Ambition</a> to be
agreeable to her I admired, produced in my Carriage a faint Similitude
of that disengaged <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec362.txt')">Manner</a> of my Belinda. The way we are in at present
is, that she sees my Passion, and sees I at present forbear speaking
of it through prudential Regards. This <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec362.txt')">Respect</a> to her she returns with
much Civility, and makes my Value for her as little a Misfortune to
me, as is consistent with Discretion. She sings very charmingly, and
is readier to do so at my Request, because she knows I love her: She
will dance with me rather than another, for the same Reason. My
Fortune must alter from what it is, before I can <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec362.txt')">speak</a> my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec362.txt')">Heart</a> to
her; and her Circumstances are not considerable enough to make up for
the Narrowness of mine. But I write to you now, only to give you the
Character of Belinda, as a Woman that has Address enough to
demonstrate a Gratitude to her Lover, without giving him Hopes of
Success in his Passion. Belinda has from a great Wit, governed by as
great Prudence, and both adorned with Innocence, the Happiness of
always being ready to discover her real Thoughts. She has many of us,
who now are her Admirers; but her Treatment of us is so just and
proportioned to our Merit towards her, and what we are in our selves,
that I protest to you I have neither Jealousy nor Hatred toward my
Rivals. Such is her Goodness, and the Acknowledgment of every Man who
admires her, that he thinks he ought to believe she will take him who
best deserves her. I will not say that this Peace among us is not
owing to Self-love, which prompts each to think himself the best
Deserver: I think there is something uncommon and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec362.txt')">worthy</a> of Imitation
in this Ladys Character. If you will please to Print my Letter, you
will oblige the little Fraternity of happy Rivals, and in a more
particular Manner,</p><p>SIR,
Your most humble Servant,
Will. Cymon.</p><p>

[Footnote 5: Estcourt, it may be remembered, connected the advertisement
of his Bumper tavern with the recommendation of himself as one ignorant
of the wine <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec362.txt')">trade</a> who relied on Brooke and Hellier, and so ensured his
Customers good wine. Among the advertisers in the Spectator Brooke and
Hellier often appeared. One of their advertisements is preceded by the
following, evidently a contrivance of their own, which shows that the
art of puffing was not then in its infancy:</p><p>'This is to give Notice, That Brooke and Hellier have not all the New
Port Wines this Year, nor above one half, the Vintners having bought
130 Pipes of Mr. Thomas Barlow and others, which are all natural, and
shall remain Genuine, on which all Gentlemen and others may depend.
Note.--Altho' Brooke and Hellier have asserted in several Papers that
they had 140 Pipes of New Oporto Wines coming from Bristol, it now
appears, since their landing, that they have only 133 Pipes, I Hhd. of
the said Wines, which shews plainly how little what they say is to be
credited.'</p><p>Then follows their long advertisement, which ends with a note that Their
New Ports, just landed, being the only New Ports in Merchants <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec362.txt')">Hands</a>, and
above One Half of all that is in London, will begin to be sold at the
old prices the I2th inst. (April) at all their Taverns and Cellars.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
