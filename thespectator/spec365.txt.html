<p>No. 365.               Tuesday, April 29, 1712.                 Budgell.</p><p></p><p>'Vere magis, quia vere calor redit ossibus--'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>The author of the Menagiana acquaints us, that discoursing one Day with
several <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec365.txt')">Ladies</a> of Quality about the Effects of the Month of May, which
infuses a kindly Warmth into the Earth, and all its Inhabitants; the
Marchioness of S----, who was one of the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec365.txt')">Company</a>, told him, That though
she would promise to be chaste in every Month besides, she could not
engage for her self in May. As the beginning therefore of this Month is
now very near, I design this Paper for a Caveat to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec365.txt')">Fair</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec365.txt')">Sex</a>, and
publish it before April is quite out, that if any of them should be
caught tripping, they may not pretend they had not timely Notice.</p><p>I am induced to this, being persuaded the above-mentioned Observation is
as well calculated for our Climate as for that of France, and that some
of our British Ladies are of the same Constitution with the French
Marchioness.</p><p>I shall leave it among Physicians to determine what may be the Cause of
such an Anniversary Inclination; whether or no it is that the Spirits
after having been as it were frozen and congealed by Winter, are now
turned loose, and set a rambling; or that the gay Prospects of <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec365.txt')">Fields</a>
and Meadows, with the Courtship of the Birds in every Bush, naturally
unbend the Mind, and soften it to Pleasure; or that, as some have
imagined, a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec365.txt')">Woman</a> is prompted by a kind of Instinct to throw herself on
a Bed of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec365.txt')">Flowers</a>, and not to let those <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec365.txt')">beautiful</a> Couches which Nature
has provided lie useless. However it be, the Effects of this Month on
the lower part of the Sex, who act without Disguise, [are [1]] very
visible. It is at this time that we see the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec365.txt')">young</a> Wenches in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec365.txt')">Country</a>
Parish dancing <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec365.txt')">round</a> a May-Pole, which one of our learned Antiquaries
supposes to be a Relique of a certain Pagan Worship that I do not think
fit to mention.</p><p>It is likewise on the first Day of this Month that we see the ruddy
Milk-Maid exerting her self in a most sprightly <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec365.txt')">manner</a> under a Pyramid
of Silver-Tankards, and, like the Virgin Tarpeia, oppress'd by the
costly Ornaments which her Benefactors lay upon her.</p><p>I need not mention the Ceremony of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec365.txt')">Green</a> Gown, which is also
peculiar to this gay Season.</p><p>The same periodical Love-Fit spreads through the whole Sex, as Mr.
Dryden well observes in his Description of this merry Month:</p><p>For thee, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec365.txt')">sweet</a> Month, the Groves green Livries wear,
If not the first, the fairest of the Year;
For thee the Graces lead the dancing Hours,
And Nature's ready Pencil paints the Flow'rs.
The sprightly May commands our Youth to keep
The Vigils of her Night, and breaks their Sleep;
Each gentle Breast with kindly Warmth she moves,
Inspires new Flames, revives extinguish'd Loves. [2]</p><p>Accordingly among the Works of the great Masters in Painting, who have
drawn this genial Season of the Year, we often observe Cupids confused
with Zephirs flying up and down promiscuously in several Parts of the
Picture. I cannot but add from my own Experience, that about this Time
of the Year Love-Letters come up to me in great Numbers from all
Quarters of the Nation.</p><p>I receiv'd an Epistle in particular by the last Post from a Yorkshire
Gentleman, who makes heavy Complaints of one Zelinda, whom it seems he
has courted unsuccessfully these three Years past. He tells me that he
designs to try her this May, and if he does not carry his Point, he will
never think of her more.</p><p>Having thus fairly admonished the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec365.txt')">female</a> Sex, and laid before them the
Dangers they are exposed to in this critical Month, I shall in the next
place lay down some Rules and Directions for their better avoiding those
Calentures which are so very frequent in this Season.</p><p>In the first place, I would advise them never to venture abroad in the
Fields, but in the Company of a Parent, a Guardian, or some other sober
discreet Person. I have before shewn how apt they are to trip in a
flowry Meadow, and shall further observe to them, that Proserpine was
out a Maying, when she met with that fatal Adventure to which Milton
alludes when he mentions</p><p>--That fair Field
Of Enna, where Proserpine gathering Flowers,
Herself a fairer Flower, by gloomy Dis
Was gathered--[3]</p><p>Since I am got into Quotations, I shall conclude this Head with Virgil's
Advice to young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec365.txt')">People</a>, while they are gathering wild Strawberries and
Nosegays, that they should have a care of the Snake in the Grass.</p><p>In the second place, I cannot but approve those Prescriptions, which our
Astrological Physicians give in their Almanacks for this Month; such as
are a spare and simple Diet, with the moderate Use of Phlebotomy.</p><p>Under this Head of Abstinence I shall also advise my fair Readers to be
in a particular manner careful how they meddle with Romances, Chocolate,
Novels, and the like Inflamers, which I look upon as very dangerous to
be made use of during this great Carnival of Nature.</p><p>As I have often declared, that I have nothing more at heart than the
Honour of my dear Country-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec365.txt')">Women</a>, I would beg them to consider, whenever
their Resolutions begin to fail them, that there are but one and thirty
Days of this soft Season, and that if they can but weather out this one
Month, the rest of the Year will be easy to them. As for that Part of
the Fair-Sex who stay in Town, I would advise them to be particularly
cautious how they give themselves up to their most innocent
Entertainments. If they cannot forbear the Play-house, I would recommend
Tragedy to them, rather than Comedy; and should think the Puppet-show
much safer for them than the Opera, all the while the Sun is in Gemini.</p><p>The Reader will observe, that this Paper is written for the use of those
Ladies who think it worth while to war against Nature in the Cause of
Honour. As for that abandon'd Crew, who do not think Virtue worth
contending for, but give up their Reputation at the first Summons, such
Warnings and Premonitions are thrown away upon them. A Prostitute is the
same easy Creature in all Months of the Year, and makes no difference
between May and December.</p><p>X.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [is] and in first Reprint.]</p><p>
