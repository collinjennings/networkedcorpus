<p>No. 373.              Thursday, May 8, 1712.                   Budgell.</p><p></p><p>'[Fallit enim Vitium specie virtutis et umbra.'</p><p>Juv. [1]]</p><p></p><p>Mr. Locke, in his Treatise of <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec373.txt')">Human</a> Understanding, has spent two
Chapters upon the Abuse of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec373.txt')">Words</a>. [2] The first and most palpable Abuse
of Words, he says, is, when they are used without clear and distinct
Ideas: The second, when we are so inconstant and unsteady in the
Application of them, that we sometimes use them to signify one Idea,
sometimes another. He adds, that the Result of our Contemplations and
Reasonings, while we have no precise Ideas fixed to our Words, must
needs be very confused and absurd. To avoid this Inconvenience, more
especially in moral Discourses, where the same <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec373.txt')">Word</a> should constantly be
used in the same Sense, he earnestly recommends the use of Definitions.
A Definition, says he, is the only way whereby the precise Meaning of
Moral Words can be known. He therefore accuses those of great
Negligence, who Discourse of Moral things with the least Obscurity in
the Terms they make use of, since upon the forementioned ground he does
not scruple to say, that he thinks Morality is capable of Demonstration
as well as the Mathematicks.</p><p>I know no two Words that have been more abused by the different and
wrong Interpretations which are put upon them, than those two, Modesty
and Assurance. To say such an one is a modest Man, sometimes indeed
passes for a good Character; but at present is very often used to
signify a sheepish awkard Fellow, who has neither Good-breeding,
Politeness, nor any Knowledge of the World.</p><p>Again, A Man of Assurance, tho at first it only denoted a Person of a
free and open Carriage, is now very usually applied to a profligate
Wretch, who can break through all the Rules of Decency and Morality
without a Blush.</p><p>I shall endeavour therefore in this Essay to restore these Words to
their true Meaning, to prevent the Idea of Modesty from being confounded
with that of Sheepishness, and to hinder Impudence from passing for
Assurance.</p><p>If I was put to define Modesty, I would <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec373.txt')">call</a> it The Reflection of an
Ingenuous Mind, either when a Man has committed an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec373.txt')">Action</a> for which he
censures himself, or fancies that he is exposed to the Censure of
others.</p><p>For this Reason a Man truly Modest is as much so when he is alone as in
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec373.txt')">Company</a>, and as subject to a Blush in his Closet, as when the Eyes of
Multitudes are upon him.</p><p>I do not remember to have met with any Instance of Modesty with which I
am so well pleased, as that celebrated one of the young Prince, whose
Father being a tributary King to the Romans, had several Complaints laid
against him before the Senate, as a Tyrant and Oppressor of his
Subjects. The Prince went to Rome to defend his Father; but coming into
the Senate, and hearing a Multitude of Crimes proved upon him, was so
oppressed when it came to his turn to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec373.txt')">speak</a>, that he was unable to utter
a Word. The Story tells us, that the Fathers were more moved at this
Instance of Modesty and Ingenuity, than they could have been by the most
Pathetick Oration; and, in short, pardoned the <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec373.txt')">guilty</a> Father for this
early Promise of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec373.txt')">Virtue</a> in the Son.</p><p>I take Assurance to be the Faculty of possessing a Man's self, or of
saying and doing indifferent things without any Uneasiness or Emotion in
the Mind. That which generally gives a Man Assurance is a moderate
Knowledge of the World, but above all a Mind fixed and determined in it
self to do nothing against the Rules of Honour and Decency. An open and
assured <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec373.txt')">Behaviour</a> is the natural Consequence of such a Resolution. A Man
thus armed, if his Words or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec373.txt')">Actions</a> are at any time misinterpreted,
retires within himself, and from the Consciousness of his own Integrity,
assumes Force enough to despise the little Censures of Ignorance or
Malice.</p><p>Every one ought to cherish and encourage in himself the Modesty and
Assurance I have here mentioned.</p><p>A Man without Assurance is liable to be made uneasy by the Folly or
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec373.txt')">Ill</a>-nature of every one he converses with. A Man without Modesty is lost
to all Sense of Honour and Virtue.</p><p>It is more than probable, that the Prince above-mentioned possessed both
these Qualifications in a very eminent degree. Without Assurance he
would never have undertaken to speak before the most august Assembly in
the World; without Modesty he would have pleaded the Cause he had taken
upon him, tho it had appeared ever so Scandalous.</p><p>From what has been said, it is plain, that Modesty and Assurance are
both amiable, and may very well meet in the same Person. When they are
thus mixed and blended together, they compose what we endeavour to
express when we say a modest Assurance; by which we understand the just
Mean between Bashfulness and Impudence.</p><p>I shall conclude with observing, that as the same Man may be both Modest
and Assured, so it is also possible for the same Person to be both
Impudent and Bashful.</p><p>We have frequent Instances of this odd kind of Mixture in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec373.txt')">People</a> of
depraved Minds and mean Education; who tho' they are not able to meet a
Man's Eyes, or pronounce a Sentence without Confusion, can Voluntarily
commit the greatest Villanies, or most indecent Actions.</p><p>Such a Person seems to have made a Resolution to do Ill even in spite of
himself, and in defiance of all those Checks and Restraints his Temper
and Complection seem to have laid in his way.</p><p>Upon the whole, I would endeavour to establish this Maxim, That the
Practice of Virtue is the most proper Method to give a Man a becoming
Assurance in his Words and Actions. Guilt always seeks to shelter it
self in one of the Extreams, and is sometimes attended with both.</p><p>X.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1:</p><p>[--Strabonem
