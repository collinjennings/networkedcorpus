<p>No. 375.                   Saturday, May 10, 1712.               Hughes.</p><p></p><p>'Non possidentem multa vocaveris

Pejusque Letho flagitium timet.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I have more than once had occasion to mention a noble Saying of Seneca
the Philosopher, That a virtuous Person struggling with Misfortunes, and
rising above them, is an Object on which the Gods themselves may look
down with Delight. [1] I shall therefore set before my Reader a Scene of
this kind of <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec375.txt')">Distress</a> in private <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec375.txt')">Life</a>, for the Speculation of this Day.</p><p>An eminent Citizen, who had lived in good Fashion and Credit, was by a
Train of Accidents, and by an unavoidable Perplexity in his Affairs,
reduced to a low Condition. There is a Modesty usually attending
faultless <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec375.txt')">Poverty</a>, which made him rather chuse to reduce his <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec375.txt')">Manner</a> of
Living to his present Circumstances, than sollicit his Friends in order
to support the Shew of an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec375.txt')">Estate</a> when the Substance was gone. His <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec375.txt')">Wife</a>,
who was a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec375.txt')">Woman</a> of Sense and Virtue, behaved her self on this Occasion
with uncommon Decency, and never appear'd so amiable in his Eyes as now.
Instead of upbraiding him with the ample <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec375.txt')">Fortune</a> she had brought, or the
many <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec375.txt')">great</a> Offers she had refused for his sake, she redoubled all the
Instances of her Affection, while her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec375.txt')">Husband</a> was continually pouring
out his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec375.txt')">Heart</a> to her in Complaints that he had ruined the best Woman in
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec375.txt')">World</a>. He sometimes came home at a time when she did not expect him,
and surpriz'd her in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec375.txt')">Tears</a>, which she endeavour'd to conceal, and always
put on an Air of Chearfulness to receive him. To lessen their Expence,
their eldest Daughter (whom I shall <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec375.txt')">call</a> Amanda) was sent into the
Country, to the House of an honest Farmer, who had <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec375.txt')">married</a> a Servant of
the Family. This young Woman was apprehensive of the Ruin which was
approaching, and had privately engaged a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec375.txt')">Friend</a> in the Neighbourhood to
give her an account of what passed from time to time in her Father's
Affairs. Amanda was in the Bloom of her Youth and Beauty, when the Lord
of the Manor, who often called in at the Farmer's House as he followd
his Country Sports, fell passionately in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec375.txt')">love</a> with her. He was a Man of
great Generosity, but from a loose Education had contracted a hearty
Aversion to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec375.txt')">Marriage</a>. He therefore entertained a Design upon Amanda's
Virtue, which at present he thought fit to keep private. The innocent
Creature, who never suspected his Intentions, was pleased with his
Person; and having observed his growing Passion for her, hoped by so
advantageous a Match she might quickly be in a capacity of supporting
her impoverish'd Relations. One day as he called to see her, he found
her in Tears over a Letter she had just receiv'd from her Friend, which
gave an Account that her Father had lately been stripped of every thing
by an Execution. The Lover, who with some Difficulty found out the Cause
of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec375.txt')">Grief</a>, took this occasion to make her a Proposal. It is
impossible to express Amanda's Confusion when she found his Pretensions
were not honourable. She was now deserted of all her Hopes, and had no
Power to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec375.txt')">speak</a>; but rushing from him in the utmost Disturbance, locked
her self up in her Chamber. He immediately dispatched a Messenger to her
Father with the following Letter.</p><p>SIR,</p><p>I have heard of your Misfortune, and have offer'd your Daughter, if
she will live with me, to settle on her Four hundred Pounds a year,
and to lay down the Sum for which you are now distressed. I will be
so ingenuous as to tell you that I do not intend Marriage: But if you
are wise, you will use your Authority with her not to be too nice,
when she has an opportunity of saving you and your Family, and of
making her self happy.
I am, &c.</p><p>This Letter came to the Hands of Amanda's Mother; she opend and read it
with great Surprize and Concern. She did not think it proper to explain
her self to the Messenger, but desiring him to call again the next
Morning, she wrote to her Daughter as follows.</p><p>Dearest Child,</p><p>Your Father and I have just now receiv'd a Letter from a Gentleman who
pretends Love to you, with a Proposal that insults our Misfortunes,
and would throw us to a lower Degree of Misery than any thing which is
come upon us. How could this barbarous Man think, that the tenderest
of Parents would be tempted to supply their Wants by giving up the
best of Children to Infamy and Ruin? It is a mean and cruel Artifice
to make this Proposal at a time when he thinks our Necessities must
compel us to any thing; but we will not eat the Bread of Shame; and
therefore we charge thee not to think of us, but to avoid the Snare
which is laid for thy Virtue. Beware of pitying us: It is not so bad
as you have perhaps been told. All <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec375.txt')">things</a> will yet be well, and I
shall write my Child better News.</p><p>I have been interrupted. I know not how I was moved to say things
would mend. As I was going on I was startled by a Noise of one that
knocked at the Door, and hath brought us an unexpected Supply of a
Debt which had long been owing. Oh! I will now tell thee all. It is
some days I have lived almost without Support, having conveyd what
little <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec375.txt')">Money</a> I could raise to your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec375.txt')">poor</a> Father--Thou wilt weep to
think where he is, yet be assured he will be soon at Liberty. That
cruel Letter would have broke his Heart, but I have concealed it from
him. I have no Companion at present besides little Fanny, who stands
watching my Looks as I write, and is crying for her Sister. She says
she is sure you are not well, having discover'd that my present
Trouble is about you. But do not think I would thus repeat my Sorrows,
to grieve thee: No, it is to intreat thee not to make them
insupportable, by adding what would be worse than all. Let us bear
chearfully an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec375.txt')">Affliction</a>, which we have not brought on our selves, and
remember there is a Power who can better deliver us out of it than by
the Loss of thy Innocence. Heaven preserve my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec375.txt')">dear</a> Child.</p><p>Affectionate Mother----</p><p>
The Messenger, notwithstanding he promised to deliver this Letter to
Amanda, carry'd it first to his Master, who he imagined would be glad to
have an Opportunity of giving it into her Hands himself. His Master was
impatient to know the Success of his Proposal, and therefore broke open
the Letter privately to see the Contents. He was not a little moved at
so true a Picture of Virtue in Distress: But at the same time was
infinitely surprized to find his Offers rejected. However, he resolved
not to suppress the Letter, but carefully sealed it up again, and
carried it to Amanda. All his Endeavours to see her were in vain, till
she was assured he brought a Letter from her Mother. He would not part
with it, but upon Condition that she should read it without leaving the
Room. While she was perusing it, he fixed his Eyes on her Face with the
deepest Attention: Her Concern gave a new Softness to her Beauty, and
when she burst into Tears, he could no longer refrain from bearing a
Part of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec375.txt')">Sorrow</a>, and telling her, that he too had read the Letter and
was resolvd to make Reparation for having been the Occasion of it. My
Reader will not be displeased to see this Second Epistle which he now
wrote to Amanda's Mother.</p><p>
MADAM,</p><p>I am full of Shame, and will never forgive my self, if I have not your
Pardon for what I lately wrote. It was far from my Intention to add
Trouble to the Afflicted; nor could any thing, but my being a Stranger
to you, have betray'd me into a Fault, for which, if I live, I shall
endeavour to make you amends, as a Son. You cannot be unhappy while
Amanda is your Daughter: nor shall be, if any thing can prevent it,
which is in the power of, MADAM,</p><p>Your most obedient
Humble Servant----</p><p>
This Letter he sent by his Steward, and soon after went up to Town
himself, to compleat the generous Act he had now resolved on. By his
Friendship and Assistance Amanda's Father was quickly in a condition of
retrieving his perplex'd Affairs. To conclude, he Marry'd Amanda, and
enjoyd the double Satisfaction of having restored a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec375.txt')">worthy</a> Family to
their former Prosperity, and of making himself happy by an Alliance to
their Virtues.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: See note on p. 148 [Footnote 1 of No. 39], vol. i.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
