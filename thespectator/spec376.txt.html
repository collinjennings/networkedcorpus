<p>No. 376.                 Monday, May 12, 1712.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>'--Pavone ex Pythagoreo--'</p><p>Persius.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I have observed that the Officer you some time ago appointed as
Inspector of Signs, has not done his Duty so well as to give you an
Account of very many strange Occurrences in the publick Streets, which
are <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec376.txt')">worthy</a> of, but have escaped your Notice. Among all the Oddnesses
which I have ever met with, that which I am now telling you of gave me
most Delight. You must have observed that all the Criers in the Street
attract the Attention of the Passengers, and of the Inhabitants in the
several Parts, by something very particular in their Tone it self, in
the dwelling upon a Note, or else making themselves wholly
unintelligible by a Scream. The Person I am so delighted with has
nothing to sell, but very gravely receives the Bounty of the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec376.txt')">People</a>,
for no other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec376.txt')">Merit</a> but the Homage they pay to his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec376.txt')">Manner</a> of signifying
to them that he wants a Subsidy. You must, sure, have heard <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec376.txt')">speak</a> of
an old Man, who walks about the City, and that part of the Suburbs
which lies beyond the Tower, performing the Office of a Day-Watchman,
followed by a Goose, which bears the Bob of his Ditty, and confirms
what he says with a Quack, Quack. I gave little heed to the mention of
this known Circumstance, till, being the other day in those Quarters,
I passed by a decrepit old Fellow with a Pole in his Hand, who just
then was bawling out, Half an Hour after one a-Clock, and immediately
a dirty Goose behind him made her Response, Quack, Quack. I could not
forbear attending this grave Procession for the length of half a
Street, with no small amazement to find the whole Place so familiarly
acquainted with a melancholy Mid-night Voice at Noon-day, giving them
the Hour, and exhorting them of the Departure of Time, with a Bounce
at their Doors. While I was full of this Novelty, I went into a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec376.txt')">Friend</a>'s House, and told him how I was diverted with their whimsical
Monitor and his Equipage. My Friend gave me the History; and
interrupted my Commendation of the Man, by telling me the Livelihood
of these two Animals is purchased rather by the good Parts of the
Goose, than of the Leader: For it seems the Peripatetick who walked
before her was a Watchman in that Neighbourhood; and the Goose of her
self by frequent hearing his Tone, out of her natural Vigilance, not
only observed, but answer'd it very regularly from Time to Time. The
Watchman was so affected with it, that he bought her, and has taken
her in Partner, only altering their Hours of Duty from Night to Day.
The Town has come into it, and they live very comfortably. This is the
Matter of Fact: Now I desire you, who are a profound Philosopher, to
consider this Alliance of Instinct and Reason; your Speculation may
turn very naturally upon the Force the superior Part of Mankind may
have upon the Spirits of such as, like this Watchman, may be very near
the Standard of Geese. And you may add to this practical Observation,
how in all Ages and Times the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec376.txt')">World</a> has been carry'd away by odd
unaccountable <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec376.txt')">things</a>, which one would think would pass upon no
Creature which had Reason; and, under the Symbol of this Goose, you
may enter into the Manner and Method of leading Creatures, with their
Eyes open, thro' thick and thin, for they know not what, they know not
why.</p><p>All which is humbly submitted to your Spectatorial Wisdom by,
SIR,
Your most humble Servant,
Michael Gander.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I have for several Years had under my Care the Government and
<a name="topic23" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec376.txt')">Education</a> of <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec376.txt')">young</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec376.txt')">Ladies</a>, which Trust I have endeavour'd to discharge
with due regard to their several Capacities and Fortunes: I have left
nothing undone to imprint in every one of them an humble courteous
Mind, accompanied with a graceful becoming Mein, and have made them
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec376.txt')">pretty</a> much acquainted with the Houshold Part of Family-Affairs; but
still I find there is something very much wanting in the Air of my
Ladies, different from what I observe in those that are esteemed your
fine bred <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec376.txt')">Women</a>. Now, Sir, I must own to you, I never suffered my
Girls to learn to Dance; but since I have read your Discourse of
Dancing, where you have described the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec376.txt')">Beauty</a> and Spirit there is in
regular Motion, I own my self your Convert, and resolve for the future
to give my young Ladies that Accomplishment. But upon imparting my
Design to their Parents, I have been made very uneasy, for some Time,
because several of them have declared, that if I did not make use of
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec376.txt')">Master</a> they recommended, they would take away their Children.
There was Colonel Jumper's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec376.txt')">Lady</a>, a Colonel of the Train-Bands, that
has a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec376.txt')">great</a> Interest in her Parish; she recommends Mr. Trott for the
prettiest Master in Town, that no Man teaches a  Jigg like him, that
she has seen him rise six or seven Capers together with the greatest
Ease imaginable, and that his Scholars twist themselves more ways than
the Scholars of any Master in Town: besides there is Madam Prim, an
Alderman's Lady, recommends a Master of her own Name, but she declares
he is not of their Family, yet a very extraordinary Man in his way;
for besides a very soft Air he has in Dancing, he gives them a
particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec376.txt')">Behaviour</a> at a Tea-Table, and in presenting their
Snuff-Box, to twirl, flip, or flirt a Fan, and how to place Patches to
the best advantage, either for Fat or Lean, Long or Oval Faces: for my
Lady says there is more in these Things than the World Imagines. But I
must confess the major Part of those I am concern'd with leave it to
me. I desire therefore, according to the inclosed Direction, you would
send your Correspondent who has writ to you on that Subject to my
House. If proper Application this way can give Innocence new Charms,
and make Virtue legible in the Countenance, I shall spare no Charge to
make my Scholars in their very Features and Limbs bear witness how
careful I have been in the other Parts of their Education.</p><p>I am, SIR,
Your most humble Servant,
Rachael Watchful</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
