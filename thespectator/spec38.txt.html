<p>No. 38.                Friday, April 13, 1711.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Cupias non placuisse nimis.'</p><p>Mart.</p><p>
A Late <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec38.txt')">Conversation</a> which I fell into, gave me an Opportunity of
observing a <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec38.txt')">great</a> deal of <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec38.txt')">Beauty</a> in a very handsome <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec38.txt')">Woman</a>, and as much
Wit in an ingenious Man, turned into Deformity in the one, and Absurdity
in the other, by the meer Force of Affectation. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec38.txt')">Fair</a> One had
something in her Person upon which her Thoughts were fixed, that she
attempted to shew to Advantage in every Look, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec38.txt')">Word</a>, and Gesture. The
Gentleman was as diligent to do Justice to his fine Parts, as the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec38.txt')">Lady</a>
to her beauteous Form: You might see his Imagination on the Stretch to
find out something uncommon, and what they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec38.txt')">call</a> bright, to entertain
her; while she writhed her self into as many different Postures to
engage him. When she laughed, her Lips were to sever at a greater
Distance than ordinary to shew her Teeth: Her Fan was to point to
somewhat at a Distance, that in the Reach she may discover the Roundness
of her Arm; then she is utterly mistaken in what she saw, falls back,
smiles at her own Folly, and is so wholly discomposed, that her Tucker
is to be adjusted, her Bosom exposed, and the whole Woman put into new
Airs and Graces. While she was doing all this, the Gallant had Time to
think of something very pleasant to say next to her, or make some unkind
Observation on some other Lady to feed her Vanity. These unhappy Effects
of Affectation, naturally led me to look into that strange State of Mind
which so generally discolours the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec38.txt')">Behaviour</a> of most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec38.txt')">People</a> we meet with.</p><p>The learned Dr. _Burnet_, [1] in his Theory of the Earth, takes Occasion
to observe, That every Thought is attended with Consciousness and
Representativeness; the Mind has nothing presented to it but what is
immediately followed by a Reflection or Conscience, which tells you
whether that which was so presented is graceful or unbecoming. This Act
of the Mind discovers it self in the Gesture, by a proper Behaviour in
those whose Consciousness goes no further than to direct them in the
just Progress of their present Thought or Action; but betrays an
Interruption in every second Thought, when the Consciousness is employed
in too fondly approving a Man's own Conceptions; which sort of
Consciousness is what we call Affectation.</p><p>As the Love of Praise is implanted in our Bosoms as a strong Incentive
to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec38.txt')">worthy</a> Actions, it is a very difficult Task to get above a Desire of
it for <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec38.txt')">things</a> that should be wholly indifferent. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec38.txt')">Women</a>, whose Hearts are
fixed upon the Pleasure they have in the Consciousness that they are the
Objects of Love and Admiration, are ever changing the Air of their
Countenances, and altering the Attitude of their Bodies, to strike the
Hearts of their Beholders with new Sense of their Beauty. The dressing
Part of our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec38.txt')">Sex</a>, whose Minds are the same with the sillyer Part of the
other, are exactly in the like uneasy Condition to be regarded for a
well-tied Cravat, an Hat cocked with an unusual Briskness, a very
well-chosen Coat, or other Instances of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec38.txt')">Merit</a>, which they are impatient
to see unobserved.</p><p>But this apparent Affectation, arising from an ill-governed
Consciousness, is not so much to be wonder'd at in such loose and
trivial Minds as these: But when you see it reign in Characters of Worth
and Distinction, it is what you cannot but lament, not without some
Indignation. It creeps into the Heart of the wise Man, as well as that
of the Coxcomb. When you see a Man of Sense look about for Applause, and
discover an itching Inclination to be commended; lay Traps for a little
Incense, even from those whose Opinion he values in nothing but his own
Favour; Who is safe against this Weakness? or who knows whether he is
guilty of it or not? The best Way to get clear of such a light Fondness
for Applause, is to take all possible Care to throw off the Love of it
upon Occasions that are not in themselves laudable; but, as it appears,
we hope for no Praise from them. Of this Nature are all Graces in Mens
Persons, Dress and bodily Deportment; which will naturally be winning
and attractive if we think not of them, but lose their Force in
proportion to our Endeavour to make them such.</p><p>When our Consciousness turns upon the main Design of Life, and our
Thoughts are employed upon the chief Purpose either in Business or
Pleasure, we shall never betray an Affectation, for we cannot be guilty
of it: But when we give the Passion for Praise an unbridled Liberty, our
Pleasure in little Perfections, robs us of what is due to us for great
Virtues and worthy Qualities. How many excellent Speeches and honest
Actions are lost, for want of being indifferent where we ought? Men are
oppressed with regard to their Way of speaking and acting; instead of
having their Thought bent upon what they should do or say, and by that
Means bury a Capacity for great things, by their fear of failing in
indifferent things. This, perhaps, cannot be called Affectation; but it
has some Tincture of it, at least so far, as that their Fear of erring
in a thing of no Consequence, argues they would be too much pleased in
performing it.</p><p>It is only from a thorough Disregard to himself in such Particulars,
that a Man can act with a laudable Sufficiency: His Heart is fixed upon
one Point in view; and he commits no Errors, because he thinks nothing
an Error but what deviates from that Intention.</p><p>The wild Havock Affectation makes in that Part of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec38.txt')">World</a> which should
be most polite, is visible where ever we turn our Eyes: It pushes Men
not only into Impertinencies in Conversation, but also in their
premeditated Speeches. At the Bar it torments the Bench, whose Business
it is to cut off all Superfluities in what is spoken before it by the
Practitioner; as well as several little Pieces of Injustice which arise
from the Law it self. I have seen it make a Man run from the Purpose
before a Judge, who was, when at the Bar himself, so close and logical a
Pleader, that with all the Pomp of Eloquence in his Power, he never
spoke a Word too much. [2]</p><p>It might be born even here, but it often ascends the Pulpit it self; and
the Declaimer, in that sacred Place, is frequently so impertinently
witty, speaks of the last Day it self with so many quaint Phrases, that
there is no Man who understands Raillery, but must resolve to sin no
more: Nay, you may behold him sometimes in Prayer for a proper Delivery
of the great Truths he is to utter, humble himself with so very well
turned Phrase, and mention his own Unworthiness in a Way so very
becoming, that the Air of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec38.txt')">pretty</a> Gentleman is preserved, under the
Lowliness of the Preacher.</p><p>I shall end this with a short Letter I writ the other Day to a very
witty Man, over-run with the Fault I am speaking of.</p><p>
Dear SIR,</p><p>'I Spent some Time with you the other Day, and must take the Liberty
of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec38.txt')">Friend</a> to tell you of the unsufferable Affectation you are guilty
of in all you say and do. When I gave you an Hint of it, you asked me
whether a Man is to be cold to what his Friends think of him? No; but
Praise is not to be the Entertainment of every Moment: He that hopes
for it must be able to suspend the Possession of it till proper
Periods of Life, or Death it self. If you would not rather be
commended than be Praiseworthy, contemn little Merits; and allow no
Man to be so free with you, as to praise you to your Face. Your Vanity
by this Means will want its Food. At the same time your Passion for
Esteem will be more fully gratified; Men will praise you in their
Actions: Where you now receive one Compliment, you will then receive
twenty Civilities. Till then you will never have of either, further
than</p><p>SIR,</p><p>Your humble Servant.'</p><p>R.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Dr. Thomas Burnet, who produced in 1681 the 'Telluris
Theoria Sacra,' translated in 1690 as 'the Sacred Theory of the Earth,'
was living in the 'Spectator's' time. He died in 1715, aged 80. He was
for 30 years Master of the Charter-house, and set himself against James
II. in refusing to admit a Roman Catholic as a Poor Brother. Burnet's
Theory, a romance that passed for science in its day, was opposed in
1696 by Whiston in his 'New Theory of the Earth' (one all for Fire, the
other all for Water), and the new Romance was Science even in the eyes
of Locke. Addison, from Oxford in 1699, addressed a Latin ode to Burnet.]</p><p>
