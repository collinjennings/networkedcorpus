<p>No. 380.                  Friday, May 16, 1712.                  Steele</p><p></p><p>'Rivalem patienter habe--'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>Thursday, May 8, 1712.</p><p>SIR,</p><p>The Character you have in the World of being the <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec380.txt')">Lady</a>'s Philosopher,
and the <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec380.txt')">pretty</a> Advice I have seen you give to others in your Papers,
make me address my self to you in this abrupt <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec380.txt')">Manner</a>, and to desire
your Opinion what in this Age a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec380.txt')">Woman</a> may <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec380.txt')">call</a> a Lover. I have lately
had a Gentleman that I thought made Pretensions to me, insomuch that
most of my Friends took Notice of it and thought we were really
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec380.txt')">married</a>; which I did not take much Pains to undeceive them, and
especially a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec380.txt')">young</a> Gentlewoman of my particular Acquaintance which was
then in the Country. She coming to Town, and seeing our Intimacy so
great, she gave her self the Liberty of taking me to task concerning
it: I ingenuously told her we were not married, but I did not know
what might the Event. She soon got acquainted with the Gentleman, and
was pleased to take upon her to examine him about it. Now whether a
new Face had made a greater Conquest than the old, I'll leave you to
judge: But I am informd that he utterly deny'd all Pretensions to
Courtship, but withal profess'd a sincere Friendship for me; but
whether Marriages are propos'd by way of Friendship or not, is what I
desire to know, and what I may really call a Lover. There are so many
who talk in a Language fit only for that Character, and yet guard
themselves against speaking in direct Terms to the Point, that it is
impossible to distinguish between Courtship and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec380.txt')">Conversation</a>. I hope
you will do me Justice both upon my Lover and my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec380.txt')">Friend</a>, if they
provoke me further: In the mean time I carry it with so equal a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec380.txt')">Behaviour</a>, that the Nymph and the Swain too are mighty at a loss; each
believes I, who know them both well, think my self revenged in their
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec380.txt')">Love</a> to one another, which creates an irreconcileable Jealousy. If all
comes right again, you shall hear further from,</p><p>SIR,
Your most obedient Servant,
Mirtilla.</p><p>
April 28, 1712.</p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>Your Observations on Persons that have behaved themselves irreverently
at Church, I doubt not have had a good Effect on some that have read
them: But there is another Fault which has hitherto escaped your
Notice, I mean of such Persons as are very zealous and punctual to
perform an Ejaculation that is only preparatory to the Service of the
Church, and yet neglect to join in the Service it self. There is an
Instance of this in a Friend of WILL. HONEYCOMB'S, who sits opposite
to me: He seldom comes in till the Prayers are about half over, and
when he has enter'd his Seat (instead of joining with the
Congregation) he devoutly holds his Hat before his Face for three or
four Moments, then bows to all his Acquaintance, sits down, takes a
Pinch of Snuff, (if it be Evening Service perhaps a Nap) and spends
the remaining Time in surveying the Congregation. Now, Sir, what I
would desire, is, that you will animadvert a little on this
Gentleman's Practice. In my Opinion, this Gentleman's Devotion,
Cap-in-Hand, is only a Compliance to the Custom of the Place, and goes
no further than a little ecclesiastical Good-Breeding. If you will not
pretend to tell us the Motives that bring such Triflers to solemn
Assemblies, yet let me desire that you will give this Letter a Place
in your Paper, and I shall remain,</p><p>SIR,
Your obliged humble Servant,
J. S.</p><p>
May the 5th.</p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>The Conversation at a Club, of which I am a Member, last Night falling
upon Vanity and the Desire of being admired, put me in mind of
relating how agreeably I was entertained at my own Door last Thursday
by a clean fresh-colour'd Girl, under the most elegant and the best
furnished Milk-Pail I had ever observed. I was glad of such an
Opportunity of seeing the Behaviour of a Coquet in low Life, and how
she received the extraordinary Notice that was taken of her; which I
found had affected every Muscle of her Face in the same manner as it
does the Feature of a first-rate Toast at a Play, or in an Assembly.
This Hint of mine made the Discourse turn upon the Sense of Pleasure;
which ended in a general Resolution, that the Milk-Maid enjoys her
Vanity as exquisitely as the Woman of Quality. I think it would not be
an improper Subject for you to examine this Frailty, and trace it to
all Conditions of Life; which is recommended to you as an Occasion of
obliging many of your Readers, among the rest,</p><p>Your most humble Servant,
T. B.</p><p>
SIR,</p><p>Coming last Week into a Coffee-house not far from the Exchange with my
Basket under my Arm, a Jew of considerable Note, as I am informed,
takes half a Dozen Oranges of me, and at the same time slides a Guinea
into my Hand; I made him a Curtsy, and went my Way: He follow'd me,
and finding I was going about my Business, he came up with me, and
told me plainly, that he gave me the Guinea with no other Intent but
to purchase my Person for an Hour. Did you so, Sir? says I: You gave
it me then to make me be wicked, I'll keep it to make me honest.
However, not to be in the least ungrateful, I promise you Ill lay it
out in a couple of Rings, and wear them for your Sake. I am so just,
Sir, besides, as to give every Body that asks how I came by my Rings
this Account of my Benefactor; but to save me the Trouble of telling
my Tale over and over again, I humbly beg the favour of you so to tell
it once for all, and you will extremely oblige,</p><p>Your humble Servant,
Betty Lemon.</p><p>May 12,  1712.</p><p>
St. Bride's, May 15, 1712.</p><p>SIR,</p><p>'Tis a great deal of Pleasure to me, and I dare say will be no less
Satisfaction to you, that I have an Opportunity of informing you, that
the Gentlemen and others of the Parish of St. Bride's, have raised a
Charity-School of fifty Girls, as before of fifty Boys. You were so
kind to recommend the Boys to the charitable World, and the other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec380.txt')">Sex</a>
hope you will do them the same Favour in Friday's Spectator for Sunday
next, when they are to appear with their humble Airs at the Parish
Church of St. Bride's. Sir, the Mention of this may possibly be
serviceable to the Children; and sure no one will omit a good Action
attended with no Expence.</p><p>
I am, SIR, Your very humble Servant,
The Sexton.</p><p>
T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
