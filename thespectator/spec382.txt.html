<p>No. 382.                  Monday, May 19, 1712.                 Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Habes confitentem reum.'</p><p>Tull.</p><p></p><p>I ought not to have neglected a Request of one of my Correspondents so
long as I have; but I dare say I have given him time to add Practice to
Profession. He sent me some time ago a Bottle or two of excellent Wine
to drink the Health of a Gentleman, who had by the Penny-Post advertised
him of an egregious Error in his Conduct. My Correspondent received the
Obligation from an unknown Hand with the Candour which is natural to an
ingenuous Mind; and promises a contrary <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec382.txt')">Behaviour</a> in that Point for the
future: He will offend his Monitor with no more Errors of that kind, but
thanks him for his Benevolence. This frank Carriage makes me reflect
upon the amiable Atonement a Man makes in an ingenuous Acknowledgment of
a Fault: All such Miscarriages as flow from Inadvertency are more than
repaid by it; for Reason, though not concerned in the Injury, employs
all its Force in the Atonement. He that says, he did not design to
disoblige you in such an <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec382.txt')">Action</a>, does as much as if he should tell you,
that tho' the Circumstance which displeased was never in his Thoughts,
he has that <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec382.txt')">Respect</a> for you, that he is unsatisfied till it is wholly
out of yours. It must be confessed, that when an Acknowledgment of
Offence is made out of Poorness of Spirit, and not Conviction of Heart,
the Circumstance is quite different: But in the Case of my
Correspondent, where both the Notice is taken and the Return made in
private, the Affair begins and ends with the highest Grace on each Side.
To make the Acknowledgment of a Fault in the highest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec382.txt')">manner</a> graceful, it
is lucky when the Circumstances of the Offender place him above any <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec382.txt')">ill</a>
Consequences from the Resentment of the Person offended. A Dauphin of
France, upon a Review of the Army, and a Command of the King to alter
the Posture of it by a March of one of the Wings, gave an improper Order
to an Officer at the Head of a Brigade, who told his Highness, he
presumed he had not received the last Orders, which were to move a
contrary Way. The Prince, instead of taking the Admonition which was
delivered in a manner that accounted for his Error with Safety to his
Understanding, shaked a Cane at the Officer; and with the return of
opprobrious Language, persisted in his own Orders. The whole Matter came
necessarily before the King, who commanded his Son, on foot, to lay his
right Hand on the Gentleman's Stirrup as he sat on Horseback in sight of
the whole Army, and ask his Pardon. When the Prince touched his Stirrup,
and was going to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec382.txt')">speak</a>, the Officer with an incredible Agility, threw
himself on the Earth, and kissed his Feet.</p><p>The Body is very little concerned in the Pleasures or Sufferings of
Souls truly <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec382.txt')">great</a>; and the Reparation, when an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec382.txt')">Honour</a> was designed this
Soldier, appeared as much too great to be borne by his Gratitude, as the
Injury was intolerable to his Resentment.</p><p>When we turn our Thoughts from these extraordinary Occurrences in common
Life, we see an ingenuous kind of Behaviour not only make up for <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec382.txt')">Faults</a>
committed, but in a manner expiate them in the very Commission. Thus
many <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec382.txt')">things</a> wherein a Man has pressed too far, he implicitly excuses, by
owning, This is a Trespass; youll pardon my Confidence; I am sensible I
have no Pretension to this Favour, and the like. But commend me to those
gay Fellows about Town who are directly impudent, and make up for it no
otherwise than by calling themselves such, and exulting in it. But this
sort of Carriage, which prompts a Man against Rules to urge what he has
a Mind to, is pardonable only when you sue for another. When you are
confident in preference of your self to others of equal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec382.txt')">Merit</a>, every Man
that loves <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec382.txt')">Virtue</a> and Modesty ought, in Defence of those Qualities, to
oppose you: But, without considering the Morality of the thing, let us
at this time behold only the natural Consequence of Candour when we
speak of ourselves.</p><p>The SPECTATOR writes often in an Elegant, often in an Argumentative, and
often in a Sublime Style, with equal Success; but how would it hurt the
reputed Author of that Paper to own, that of the most beautiful Pieces
under his Title, he is barely the Publisher? There is nothing but what a
Man really performs, can be an Honour to him; what he takes more than he
ought in the Eye of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec382.txt')">World</a>, he loses in the Conviction of his own
Heart; and a Man must lose his Consciousness, that is, his very Self,
before he can rejoice in any Falshood without inward Mortification.</p><p>Who has not seen a very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec382.txt')">Criminal</a> at the Bar, when his Counsel and
Friends have done all that they could for him in vain, prevail upon the
whole Assembly to pity him, and his Judge to recommend his Case to the
Mercy of the Throne, without offering any thing new in his Defence, but
that he, whom before we wished convicted, became so out of his own
Mouth, and took upon himself all the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec382.txt')">Shame</a> and Sorrow we were just
before preparing for him? The great Opposition to this kind of Candour,
arises from the unjust Idea <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec382.txt')">People</a> ordinarily have of what we <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec382.txt')">call</a> an
high Spirit. It is far from Greatness of Spirit to persist in the Wrong
in any thing, nor is it a Diminution of Greatness of Spirit to have been
in the Wrong: Perfection is not the Attribute of Man, therefore he is
not degraded by the Acknowledgment of an Imperfection: But it is the
Work of little Minds to imitate the Fortitude of great Spirits on <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec382.txt')">worthy</a>
Occasions, by Obstinacy in the Wrong. This Obstinacy prevails so far
upon them, that they make it extend to the Defence of Faults in their
very Servants. It would swell this Paper to too great a length, should I
insert all the Quarrels and Debates which are now on foot in this Town;
where one <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec382.txt')">Party</a>, and in some Cases both, is sensible of being on the
faulty Side, and have not Spirit enough to Acknowledge it. Among the
Ladies the Case is very common, for there are very few of them who know
that it is to maintain a true and high Spirit, to throw away from it all
which it self disapproves, and to scorn so pitiful a Shame, as that
which disables the Heart from acquiring a Liberality of Affections and
Sentiments. The candid Mind, by acknowledging and discarding its Faults,
has Reason and Truth for the Foundation of all its <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec382.txt')">Passions</a> and Desires,
and consequently is happy and simple; the disingenuous Spirit, by
Indulgence of one unacknowledged Error, is intangled with an After-Life
of Guilt, Sorrow, and Perplexity.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
