<p>No. 389.                  Tuesday, May 27, 1712.               Budgell.</p><p></p><p>'Meliora pii docuere parentes.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Nothing has more surprized the Learned in England, than the <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec389.txt')">Price</a> which
a small Book, intitled Spaccio della Bestia triom fante, [1] bore in a
late Auction. This Book was sold for [thirty [2]] Pound. As it was
written by one Jordanus Brunus, a professed Atheist, with a design to
depreciate <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec389.txt')">Religion</a>, every one was apt to fancy, from the extravagant
Price it bore, that there must be something in it very formidable.</p><p>I must confess that happening to get a sight of one of them my self, I
could not forbear perusing it with this Apprehension; but found there
was so very little Danger in it, that I shall venture to give my Readers
a fair Account of the whole Plan upon which this wonderful Treatise is
built.</p><p>The Author pretends that Jupiter once upon a Time resolved on a
Reformation of the Constellations: for which purpose having summoned the
Stars together, he complains to them of the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec389.txt')">great</a> Decay of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec389.txt')">Worship</a>
of the Gods, which he thought so much the harder, having called several
of those Celestial Bodies by the Names of the Heathen Deities, and by
that means made the Heavens as it were a Book of the Pagan Theology.
Momus tells him, that this is not to be wondered at, since there were so
many scandalous Stories of the Deities; upon which the Author takes
occasion to cast Reflections upon all other Religions, concluding, that
Jupiter, after a full Hearing, discarded the Deities out of Heaven, and
called the Stars by the Names of the Moral Virtues.</p><p>This short Fable, which has no Pretence in it to Reason or Argument, and
but a very small Share of Wit, has however recommended it self wholly by
its Impiety to those weak Men, who would distinguish themselves by the
Singularity of their Opinions.</p><p>There are two Considerations which have been often urged against
Atheists, and which they never yet could get over. The first is, that
the greatest and most eminent Persons of all Ages have been against
them, and always complied with the publick Forms of Worship established
in their respective Countries, when there was nothing in them either
derogatory to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec389.txt')">Honour</a> of the Supreme Being, or prejudicial to the
Good of Mankind.</p><p>The Platos and Ciceros among the Ancients; the Bacons, the Boyles, and
the Lockes, among our own Countrymen, are all Instances of what I have
been saying; not to mention any of the Divines, however celebrated,
since our Adversaries challenge all those, as Men who have too much
Interest in this Case to be impartial Evidences.</p><p>But what has been often urged as a Consideration of much more Weight,
is, not only the Opinion of the Better Sort, but the general Consent of
Mankind to this great Truth; which I think could not possibly have come
to pass, but from one of the three following Reasons; either that the
Idea of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec389.txt')">God</a> is innate and co-existent with the Mind it self; or that
this Truth is so very obvious, that it is discoverd by the first
Exertion of Reason in Persons of the most ordinary Capacities; or,
lastly, that it has been delivered down to us thro' all Ages by a
Tradition from the first Man.</p><p>The Atheists are equally confounded, to which ever of these three Causes
we assign it; they have been so pressed by this last Argument from the
general Consent of Mankind, that after great search and pains they
pretend to have found out a Nation of Atheists, I mean that Polite
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec389.txt')">People</a> the Hottentots.</p><p>I dare not shock my Readers with a Description of the Customs and
Manners of these Barbarians, who are in every <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec389.txt')">respect</a> scarce one degree
above Brutes, having no Language among them but a confused [Gabble [3]]
which is neither well understood by themselves or others.</p><p>It is not however to be imagin'd how much the Atheists have gloried in
these their good Friends and Allies.</p><p>If we boast of a Socrates, or a Seneca, they may now confront them with
these great Philosophers the Hottentots.</p><p>Tho even this Point has, not without Reason, been several times
controverted, I see no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec389.txt')">manner</a> of harm it could do Religion, if we should
entirely give them up this elegant Part of Mankind.</p><p>Methinks nothing more shews the Weakness of their Cause, than that no
Division of their Fellow-Creatures join with them, but those among whom
they themselves own Reason is almost defaced, and who have little else
but their Shape, which can entitle them to any Place in the Species.</p><p>Besides these <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec389.txt')">poor</a> Creatures, there have now and then been Instances of
a few crazed People in several Nations, who have denied the Existence of
a Deity.</p><p>The Catalogue of these is however very short; even Vanini [4] the most
celebrated Champion for the Cause, professed before his Judges that he
believed the Existence of a God, and taking up a Straw which lay before
him on the Ground, assured them, that alone was sufficient to convince
him of it; alledging several Arguments to prove that 'twas impossible
Nature alone could create anything.</p><p>I was the other day reading an Account of Casimir Liszynski, a Gentleman
of Poland, who was convicted and executed for this Crime. [5] The manner
of his Punishment was very particular. As soon as his Body was burnt his
Ashes were put into a Cannon, and shot into the Air towards Tartary.</p><p>I am apt to believe, that if something like this Method of Punishment
should prevail in England, such is the natural good Sense of the British
Nation, that whether we rammed an Atheist [whole] into a great Gun, or
pulverized our Infidels, as they do in Poland, we should not have many
Charges.</p><p>I should, however, propose, while our Ammunition lasted, that instead of
Tartary, we should always keep two or three Cannons ready pointed
towards the Cape of Good Hope, in order to shoot our Unbelievers into
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec389.txt')">Country</a> of the Hottentots.</p><p>In my Opinion, a solemn judicial Death is too great an Honour for an
Atheist, tho' I must allow the Method of exploding him, as it is
practised in this ludicrous kind of Martyrdom, has something in it
proper [enough] to the Nature of his Offence.</p><p>There is indeed a great Objection against this Manner of treating them.
Zeal for Religion is of so active a Nature, that it seldom knows where
to rest; for which reason I am afraid, after having discharged our
Atheists, we might possibly think of shooting off our Sectaries; and, as
one does not foresee the Vicissitude of human Affairs, it might one time
or other come to a Man's own turn to fly out of the Mouth of a
Demi-culverin.</p><p>If any of my Readers imagine that I have treated these Gentlemen in too
Ludicrous a Manner, I must confess, for my own part, I think reasoning
against such Unbelievers upon a Point that shocks the Common Sense of
Mankind, is doing them too great an Honour, giving them a Figure in the
Eye of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec389.txt')">World</a>, and making People fancy that they have more in them
than they really have.</p><p>As for those Persons who have any Scheme of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec389.txt')">Religious</a> Worship, I am for
treating such with the utmost Tenderness, and should endeavour to shew
them their Errors with the greatest Temper and Humanity: but as these
Miscreants are for throwing down Religion in general, for stripping
Mankind of what themselves own is of excellent use in all great
Societies, without once offering to establish any thing in the Room of
it; I think the best way of dealing with them, is to retort their own
Weapons upon them, which are those of Scorn and Mockery.</p><p>X.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: The book was bought in 1711 for Â£28 by Mr. Walter Clavel at
the sale of the library of Mr. Charles Barnard. It had been bought in
1706 at the sale of Mr. Bigot's library with five others for two
shillings and a penny. Although Giordano Bruno was burnt as a heretic,
he was a noble thinker, no professed atheist, but a man of the reformed
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec389.txt')">faith</a>, who was in advance of Calvin, a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec389.txt')">friend</a> of Sir Philip Sydney, and
as good a man as Mr. Budgell.]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: Fifty]</p><p>
[Footnote 3: Gabling]</p><p>
[Footnote 4: Vanini, like Giordano Bruno, has his memory dishonoured
through the carelessness with which men take for granted the assertions
of his enemies. Whether burnt or not, every religious thinker of the
sixteenth century who opposed himself to the narrowest views of those
who claimed to be the guardians of orthodoxy was remorselessly maligned.
If he was the leader of a party, there were hundreds to maintain his
honour against calumny. If he was a solitary searcher after truth, there
was nothing but his single life and work to set against the host of his
defamers. Of Vanini's two books, one was written to prove the existence
of a God, yet here is Mr. Budgell calling him the most celebrated
champion for the cause of atheism.]</p><p>
[Footnote 5: Casimir Lyszynski was a Polish Knight, executed at Warsaw
in 1689, in the barbarous manner which appears to tickle Mr. Budgell's
fancy. It does not appear that he had written anything.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
