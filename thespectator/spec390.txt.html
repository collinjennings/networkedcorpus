<p>No. 390.                Wednesday, May 28, 1712.                 Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Non pudendo sed non faciendo id quod non decet impudenti√¶ nomen
effugere debemus.'</p><p>Tull.</p><p></p><p>Many are the Epistles I receive from <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec390.txt')">Ladies</a> extremely afflicted that
they lie under the Observation of scandalous <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec390.txt')">People</a>, who love to defame
their Neighbours, and make the unjustest Interpretation of innocent and
indifferent <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec390.txt')">Actions</a>. They describe their own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec390.txt')">Behaviour</a> so unhappily,
that there indeed lies some Cause of Suspicion upon them. It is certain,
that there is no Authority for Persons who have nothing else to do, to
pass away Hours of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec390.txt')">Conversation</a> upon the Miscarriages of other People;
but since they will do so, they who value their Reputation should be
cautious of Appearances to their Disadvantage. But very often our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec390.txt')">young</a>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec390.txt')">Women</a>, as well as the middle-aged and the gay Part of those growing old,
without entering into a formal League for that purpose, to a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec390.txt')">Woman</a> agree
upon a short Way to preserve their Characters, and go on in a Way that
at best is only not <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec390.txt')">vicious</a>. The Method is, when an <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec390.txt')">ill</a>-naturd or
talkative Girl has said any thing that bears hard upon some part of
another's Carriage, this Creature, if not in any of their little Cabals,
is run down for the most censorious dangerous Body in the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec390.txt')">World</a>. Thus
they guard their Reputation rather than their Modesty; as if Guilt lay
in being under the Imputation of a Fault, and not in a Commission of it.
Orbicilla is the kindest poor thing in the Town, but the most blushing
Creature living: It is true she has not lost the Sense of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec390.txt')">Shame</a>, but she
has lost the Sense of Innocence. If she had more Confidence, and never
did anything which ought to stain her Cheeks, would she not be much more
modest without that ambiguous Suffusion, which is the Livery both of
Guilt and Innocence? Modesty consists in being conscious of no Ill, and
not in being ashamed of having done it. When People go upon any other
Foundation than the Truth of their own Hearts for the Conduct of their
Actions, it lies in the power of scandalous Tongues to carry the World
before them, and make the rest of Mankind fall in with the Ill, for fear
of Reproach. On the other hand, to do what you ought, is the ready way
to make Calumny either silent or ineffectually malicious. Spencer, in
his Fairy Queen, says admirably to young Ladies under the Distress of
being defamed;</p><p>'The best, said he, that I can you advise,
Is to avoid th' Occasion of the Ill;
For when the Cause, whence Evil doth arise,
Removed is, th' Effect surceaseth still.
Abstain from Pleasure, and restrain your Will,
Subdue Desire, and bridle loose Delight:
Use scanted Diet, and forbear your Fill;
Shun Secrecy, and talk in open sight:
So shall you soon repair your present evil Plight. [1]'</p><p>Instead of this Care over their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec390.txt')">Words</a> and Actions, recommended by a Poet
in old Queen Bess's Days, the modern Way is to do and say what you
please, and yet be the prettiest sort of Woman in the World. If Fathers
and Brothers will defend a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec390.txt')">Lady</a>'s <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec390.txt')">Honour</a>, she is quite as safe as in her
own Innocence. Many of the Distressed, who suffer under the Malice of
evil Tongues, are so harmless that they are every Day they live asleep
till twelve at Noon; concern themselves with nothing but their own
Persons till two; take their necessary Food between that time and four;
visit, go to the Play, and sit up at Cards till towards the ensuing
Morn; and the malicious World shall draw Conclusions from innocent
Glances, short Whispers, or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec390.txt')">pretty</a> familiar Railleries with fashionable
Men, that these <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec390.txt')">Fair</a> ones are not as rigid as Vestals. It is certain,
say these goodest Creatures very well, that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec390.txt')">Virtue</a> does not consist in
constrain'd Behaviour and wry Faces, that must be allow'd; but there is
a Decency in the Aspect and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec390.txt')">Manner</a> of Ladies contracted from an Habit of
Virtue, and from general Reflections that regard a modest Conduct, all
which may be understood, tho' they cannot be described. A young Woman of
this sort claims an Esteem mixed with Affection and Honour, and meets
with no Defamation; or if she does, the wild Malice is overcome with an
undisturbed Perseverance in her Innocence. To <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec390.txt')">speak</a> freely, there are
such Coveys of Coquets about this Town, that if the Peace were not kept
by some impertinent Tongues of their own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec390.txt')">Sex</a>, which keep them under some
Restraint, we should have no manner of Engagement upon them to keep them
in any tolerable Order.</p><p>As I am a SPECTATOR, and behold how plainly one Part of Womankind
ballance the Behaviour of the other, whatever I may think of Talebearers
or Slanderers, I cannot wholly suppress them, no more than a General
would discourage Spies. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec390.txt')">Enemy</a> would easily surprize him whom they
knew had no Intelligence of their Motions. It is so far otherwise with
me, that I acknowledge I permit a She-Slanderer or two in every Quarter
of the Town, to live in the Characters of Coquets, and take all the
innocent Freedoms of the rest, in order to send me Information of the
Behaviour of their respective Sisterhoods.</p><p>But as the Matter of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec390.txt')">Respect</a> to the World, which looks on, is carried
on, methinks it is so very easie to be what is in the general called
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec390.txt')">Virtuous</a>, that it need not cost one Hour's Reflection in a Month to
preserve that Appellation. It is pleasant to hear the pretty Rogues talk
of Virtue and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec390.txt')">Vice</a> among each other: She is the laziest Creature in the
World, but I must confess strictly Virtuous: The peevishest Hussy
breathing, but as to her Virtue she is without Blemish: She has not the
least Charity for any of her Acquaintance, but I must allow rigidly
Virtuous. As the unthinking Part of the Male World <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec390.txt')">call</a> every Man a Man
of Honour, who is not a Coward; so the Crowd of the other Sex terms
every Woman who will not be a Wench, Virtuous.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: F. Q. Bk VI. canto vi. st. 14.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
