<p>No. 395.                  Tuesday, June 3, 1712.              Budgell.</p><p></p><p>'Quod nunc ratio est, Impetus ante fuit.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>Beware of the Ides of March, said the Roman Augur to Julius Cæsar:
Beware of the Month of May, says the British Spectator to his <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec395.txt')">fair</a>
<a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec395.txt')">Country</a>-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec395.txt')">women</a>. The Caution of the first was unhappily neglected, and
Cæsar's Confidence cost him his Life. I am apt to flatter my self that
my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec395.txt')">pretty</a> Readers had much more regard to the Advice I gave them, since
I have yet received very few Accounts of any notorious Trips made in the
last Month.</p><p>But tho' I hope for the best, I shall not pronounce too positively on
this point, till I have seen forty Weeks well over, at which Period of
Time, as my good <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec395.txt')">Friend</a> Sir ROGER has often told me, he has more
Business as a Justice of Peace, among the dissolute <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec395.txt')">young</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec395.txt')">People</a> in the
Country, than at any other Season of the Year.</p><p>Neither must I forget a Letter which I received near a Fortnight since
from a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec395.txt')">Lady</a>, who, it seems, could hold out no longer, telling me she
looked upon the Month as then out, for that she had all along reckoned
by the New Style.</p><p>On the other hand, I have great reason to believe, from several angry
Letters which have been sent to me by disappointed Lovers, that my
Advice has been of very signal Service to the fair <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec395.txt')">Sex</a>, who, according
to the old Proverb, were Forewarned forearm'd.</p><p>One of these Gentlemen tells me, that he would have given me an hundred
Pounds, rather than I should have publishd that Paper; for that his
Mistress, who had promised to explain herself to him about the Beginning
of May, upon reading that Discourse told him that she would give him her
Answer in June.</p><p>Thyrsis acquaints me, that when he desired Sylvia to take a Walk in the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec395.txt')">Fields</a>, she told him the Spectator had forbidden her.</p><p>Another of my Correspondents, who writes himself Mat Meager, complains,
that whereas he constantly used to Breakfast with his Mistress upon
Chocolate, going to wait upon her the first of May he found his usual
Treat very much changed for the worse, and has been forced to feed ever
since upon <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec395.txt')">Green</a> Tea.</p><p>As I begun this Critical Season with a Caveat to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec395.txt')">Ladies</a>, I shall
conclude it with a Congratulation, and do most heartily wish them Joy of
their happy Deliverance.</p><p>They may now reflect with Pleasure on the Dangers they have escaped, and
look back with as much Satisfaction on their Perils that threat'ned
them, as their Great-Grandmothers did formerly on the Burning
Plough-shares, after having passed through the Ordeal Tryal. The
Instigations of the Spring are now abated. The Nightingale gives over
her Love-labourd Song, as Milton phrases it, the Blossoms are fallen,
and the Beds of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec395.txt')">Flowers</a> swept away by the Scythe of the Mower.</p><p>I shall now allow my Fair Readers to return to their Romances and
Chocolate, provided they make use of them with Moderation, till about
the middle of the Month, when the Sun shall have made some Progress in
the Crab. Nothing is more dangerous, than too much Confidence and
Security. The Trojans, who stood upon their Guard all the while the
Grecians lay before their City, when they fancied the Siege was raised,
and the Danger past, were the very next Night burnt in their Beds: I
must also observe, that as in some Climates there is a perpetual Spring,
so in some <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec395.txt')">Female</a> Constitutions there is a perpetual May: These are a
kind of Valetudinarians in Chastity, whom I would continue in a constant
Diet. I cannot think these wholly out of Danger, till they have looked
upon the other Sex at least Five Years through a Pair of Spectacles.
WILL. HONEYCOMB has often assured me, that its much easier to steal one
of this Species, when she has passed her grand Climacterick, than to
carry off an icy Girl on this side Five and Twenty; and that a Rake of
his Acquaintance, who had in vain endeavoured to gain the Affections of
a young Lady of Fifteen, had at last made his Fortune by running away
with her Grandmother.</p><p>But as I do not design this Speculation for the Evergreens of the Sex, I
shall again apply my self to those who would willingly listen to the
Dictates of Reason and Virtue, and can now hear me in cold Blood. If
there are any who have forfeited their Innocence, they must now consider
themselves under that Melancholy View, in which Chamont regards his
Sister, in those <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec395.txt')">beautiful</a> Lines.</p><p>--Long she flourish'd,
Grew <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec395.txt')">sweet</a> to Sense, and lovely to the Eye;
Till at the last a cruel Spoiler came,
Cropt this fair Rose, and rifled all its Sweetness;
Then cast it like a loathsome Weed away. [1]</p><p>On the contrary, she who has observed the timely Cautions I gave her,
and lived up to the Rules of Modesty, will now Flourish like a Rose in
June, with all her Virgin Blushes and Sweetness about her: I must,
however, desire these last to consider, how shameful it would be for a
General, who has made a Successful Campaign, to be surprized in his
Winter Quarters: It would be no less dishonourable for a Lady to lose in
any other Month of the Year, what she has been at the pains to preserve
in May.</p><p>There is no Charm in the Female Sex, that can supply the place of
Virtue. Without Innocence, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec395.txt')">Beauty</a> is unlovely, and Quality contemptible,
Good-breeding degenerates into Wantonness, and Wit into Impudence. It is
observed, that all the Virtues are represented by both Painters and
Statuaries under Female Shapes, but if any one of them has a more
particular Title to that Sex, it is Modesty. I shall leave it to the
Divines to guard them against the opposite Vice, as they may be
overpowerd by Temptations; It is sufficient for me to have warned them
against it, as they may be led astray by Instinct.</p><p>I desire this Paper may be read with more than ordinary Attention, at
all Tea-Tables within the Cities of London and Westminster.</p><p>X.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Otway's Orphan, Act IV.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
