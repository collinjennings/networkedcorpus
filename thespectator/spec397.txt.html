<p>No. 397.               Thursday, June 5, 1712.                 Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Dolor ipse disertum
Fecerat--'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>As the Stoick Philosophers discard all Passions in general, they will
not allow a Wise Man so much as to pity the Afflictions of another. If
thou seest thy <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec397.txt')">Friend</a> in Trouble, says Epictetus, thou mayst put on a
Look of <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec397.txt')">Sorrow</a>, and condole with him, but take care that thy Sorrow be
not real. [1] The more rigid of this Sect would not comply so far as to
shew even such an outward Appearance of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec397.txt')">Grief</a>, but when one told them of
any Calamity that had befallen even the nearest of their Acquaintance,
would immediately reply, What is that to me? If you aggravated the
Circumstances of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec397.txt')">Affliction</a>, and shewed how one Misfortune was
followed by another, the Answer was still, All this may be true, but
what is it to me?</p><p>For my own part, I am of Opinion, Compassion does not only refine and
civilize Humane Nature, but has something in it more pleasing and
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec397.txt')">agreeable</a> than what can be met with in such an indolent Happiness, such
an Indifference to Mankind as that in which the Stoicks placed their
Wisdom. As <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec397.txt')">Love</a> is the most delightful Passion, Pity is nothing else but
Love softned by a degree of Sorrow: In short, it is a kind of pleasing
Anguish, as well as generous Sympathy, that knits Mankind together, and
blends them in the same common Lot.</p><p>Those who have laid down Rules for Rhetorick or Poetry, advise the
Writer to work himself up, if possible, to the Pitch of Sorrow which he
endeavours to produce in others. There are none therefore who stir up
Pity so much as those who indite their own Sufferings. Grief has a
natural Eloquence belonging to it, and breaks out in more moving
Sentiments than be supplied by the finest Imagination. Nature on this
Occasion dictates a thousand passionate <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec397.txt')">things</a> which cannot be supplied
by Art.</p><p>It is for this Reason that the short Speeches, or Sentences which we
often meet with in Histories, make a deeper Impression on the Mind of
the Reader, than the most laboured Strokes in a well-written Tragedy.
Truth and Matter of Fact sets the Person actually before us in the one,
whom Fiction places at a greater Distance from us in the other. I do not
remember to have seen any Ancient or Modern Story more affecting than a
Letter of Ann of Bologne, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec397.txt')">Wife</a> to King Henry the Eighth, and Mother to
Queen Elizabeth, which is still extant in the Cotton Library, as written
by her own Hand.</p><p>Shakespear himself could not have made her talk in a Strain so suitable
to her Condition and Character. One sees in it the Expostulations of a
slighted Lover, the Resentments of an injured <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec397.txt')">Woman</a>, and the Sorrows of
an imprisoned Queen. I need not acquaint my Reader that this Princess
was then under Prosecution for Disloyalty to the King's Bed, and that
she was afterwards publickly beheaded upon the same Account, though this
Prosecution was believed by many to proceed, as she her self intimates,
rather from the King's Love to Jane Seymour than from any actual Crime
in Ann of Bologne.</p><p>
Queen Ann Boleyn's last Letter to King Henry.</p><p>[Cotton Libr. Otho C. 10.]</p><p>SIR,</p><p>Your Grace's Displeasure, and my Imprisonment, are Things so strange
unto me, as what to write, or what to excuse, I am altogether
ignorant. Whereas you send unto me (willing me to confess a Truth, and
so obtain your Favour) by such an one, whom you know to be mine
ancient professed Enemy, I no sooner received this Message by him,
than I rightly conceived your Meaning; and if, as you say, confessing
a Truth indeed may procure my Safety, I shall with all Willingness and
Duty perform your Command.</p><p>But let not your Grace ever imagine, that your poor Wife will ever be
brought to acknowledge a Fault, where not so much as a Thought thereof
preceded. And to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec397.txt')">speak</a> a Truth, never Prince had Wife more Loyal in
all Duty, and in all true Affection, than you have ever found in Ann
Boleyn: with which Name and Place I could willingly have contented my
self, if God and your Grace's Pleasure had been so pleased. Neither
did I at any time so far forget my self in my Exaltation, or received
Queenship, but that I always looked for such an Alteration as now I
find; for the Ground of my Preferment being on no surer Foundation
than your Grace's Fancy, the least Alteration I knew was fit and
sufficient to draw that Fancy to some other [Object. [2]] You have
chosen me, from a low Estate, to be your Queen and Companion, far
beyond my Desert or Desire. If then you found me <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec397.txt')">worthy</a> of such
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec397.txt')">Honour</a>, good your Grace let not any light Fancy, or bad Counsel of
mine Enemies, withdraw your Princely Favour from me; neither let that
Stain, that unworthy Stain, of a Disloyal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec397.txt')">Heart</a> towards your good
Grace, ever cast so foul a Blot on your most Dutiful Wife, and the
Infant-Princess your Daughter. Try me, good King, but let me have a
lawful Tryal, and let not my sworn Enemies sit as my Accusers and
Judges; Yea let me receive an open Tryal, for my Truth shall <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec397.txt')">fear</a> no
open Shame; then shall you see either mine Innocence cleared, your
Suspicion and Conscience satisfied, the Ignominy and Slander of the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec397.txt')">World</a> stopped, or my Guilt openly declared. So that whatsoever God or
you may determine of me, your Grace may be freed from an open Censure,
and mine Offence being so lawfully proved, your Grace is at liberty,
both before God and Man, not only to Execute worthy Punishment on me
as an unlawful Wife, but to follow your Affection, already settled on
that Party, for whose sake I am now as I am, whose Name I could some
good while since have pointed unto, your Grace being not ignorant of
my Suspicion therein.</p><p>But if you have already determined of me, and that not only my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec397.txt')">Death</a>,
but an Infamous Slander must bring you the enjoying of your desired
Happiness; then I desire of God, that he will pardon your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec397.txt')">great</a> Sin
therein, and likewise mine Enemies, the Instruments thereof; and that
he will not <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec397.txt')">call</a> you to a strict Account for your unprincely and cruel
Usage of me, at his general Judgment Seat, where both you and my self
must shortly appear, and in whose Judgment I doubt not (whatsoever the
World may think of me) mine Innocence shall be openly known, and
sufficiently cleared.</p><p>My last and only Request shall be, that my self may only bear the
Burthen of your Grace's Displeasure, and that it may not touch the
innocent Souls of those poor Gentlemen, who (as I understand) are
likewise in strait Imprisonment for my sake. If ever I have found
Favour in your Sight, if ever the Name of Ann Boleyn hath been
pleasing in your Ears, then let me obtain this Request, and I will so
leave to trouble your Grace any further, with mine earnest Prayers to
the Trinity to have your Grace in his good Keeping, and to direct you
in all your Actions. From my doleful Prison in the Tower, this sixth
of May;</p><p>Your most Loyal,
And ever Faithful Wife,
Ann Boleyn.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1:</p><p>When you see a Neighbour in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec397.txt')">Tears</a>, and hear him lament the Absence of
his Son, the Hazards of his Voyage into some remote Part of the World,
or the Loss of his Estate; keep upon your Guard, for fear lest some
false Ideas that may rise upon these Occasions, surprise you into a
Mistake, as if this Man were really miserable, upon the Account of
these outward Accidents. But be sure to distinguish wisely, and tell
your self immediately, that the Thing which really afflicts this
Person is not really the Accident it self, (for other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec397.txt')">People</a>, under
his Circumstances, are not equally afflicted with it) but merely the
Opinion which he hath formed to himself concerning this Accident.
Notwithstanding all which, you may be allowed, as far as Expressions
and outward <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec397.txt')">Behaviour</a> go, to comply with him; and if Occasion require,
to bear a part in his Sighs, and Tears too; but then you must be sure
to take care, that this Compliance does not infect your Mind, nor
betray you to an inward and real Sorrow, upon any such
Account.</p><p>Epictetus his Morals, with Simplicius his Comment.</p><p>Made English from the Greek by George Stanhope (1694) chapter xxii.]</p><p>
