<p>No. 398.               Friday, June 6, 1712.                    Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Insanire pares certa ratione modoque.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p><a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec398.txt')">Cynthio</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec398.txt')">Flavia</a> are Persons of Distinction in this Town, who have
been <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec398.txt')">Lovers</a> these ten Months last past, and writ to each other for
Gallantry Sake, under those feigned Names; Mr. Such a one and Mrs. Such
a one not being capable of raising the Soul out of the ordinary Tracts
and Passages of Life, up to that Elevation which makes the Life of the
Enamoured so much superior to that of the rest of the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec398.txt')">World</a>. But ever
since the beauteous Cecilia has made such a Figure as she now does in
the Circle of Charming <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec398.txt')">Women</a>, Cynthio has been secretly one of her
Adorers. LÃ¦titia has been the finest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec398.txt')">Woman</a> in Town these three Months,
and so long Cynthio has acted the Part of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec398.txt')">Lover</a> very awkwardly in the
Presence of Flavia. Flavia has been too blind towards him, and has too
sincere an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec398.txt')">Heart</a> of her own to observe a thousand <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec398.txt')">things</a> which would
have discovered this Change of Mind to any one less engaged than she
was. Cynthio was musing Yesterday in the Piazza in Covent-Garden, and
was saying to himself that he was a very ill Man to go on in visiting
and professing <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec398.txt')">Love</a> to Flavia, when his Heart was enthralled to another.
It is an Infirmity that I am not constant to Flavia; but it would be
still a greater Crime, since I cannot continue to love her, to profess
that I do. To marry a Woman with the Coldness that usually indeed comes
on after <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec398.txt')">Marriage</a>, is ruining one's self with one's Eyes open; besides
it is really doing her an Injury. This last Consideration, forsooth, of
injuring her in persisting, made him resolve to break off upon the first
favourable Opportunity of making her angry. When he was in this Thought,
he saw <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec398.txt')">Robin</a> the Porter who waits at Will's Coffee-House, passing by.
Robin, you must know, is the best Man in Town for carrying a Billet; the
Fellow has a thin Body, swift Step, demure Looks, sufficient Sense, and
knows the Town. This Man carried Cynthio's first Letter to Flavia, and
by frequent Errands ever since, is well known to her. The Fellow covers
his Knowledge of the Nature of his Messages with the most exquisite low
Humour imaginable: The first he obliged Flavia to take, was, by
complaining to her that he had a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec398.txt')">Wife</a> and three Children, and if she did
not take that Letter, which, he was sure, there was no Harm in, but
rather Love, his Family must go supperless to Bed, for the Gentleman
would pay him according as he did his Business. Robin therefore Cynthio
now thought fit to make use of, and gave him Orders to wait before
Flavia's Door, and if she called him to her, and asked whether it was
Cynthio who passed by, he should at first be loth to own it was, but
upon Importunity confess it. There needed not much Search into that Part
of the Town to find a well-dressed Hussey fit for the Purpose Cynthio
designed her. As soon as he believed Robin was posted, he drove by
Flavia's Lodgings in an Hackney-Coach and a Woman in it. Robin was at
the Door talking with Flavia's Maid, and Cynthio pulled up the Glass as
surprized, and hid his Associate. The Report of this Circumstance soon
flew up Stairs, and Robin could not deny but the Gentleman favoured his
Master; yet if it was he, he was sure the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec398.txt')">Lady</a> was but his Cousin whom
he had seen ask for him; adding that he believed she was a poor
Relation, because they made her wait one Morning till he was awake.
Flavia immediately writ the following Epistle, which Robin brought to
Wills</p><p>
June 4, 1712.</p><p>SIR,</p><p>It is in vain to deny it, basest, falsest of Mankind; my Maid, as well
as the Bearer, saw you.</p><p>The injur'd Flavia.</p><p>
After Cynthio had read the Letter, he asked Robin how she looked, and
what she said at the Delivery of it. Robin said she spoke short to him,
and called him back again, and had nothing to say to him, and bid him
and all the Men in the World go out of her Sight; but the Maid followed,
and bid him bring an Answer.</p><p>Cynthio returned as follows.</p><p>
June 4, Three Afternoon, 1712.</p><p>Madam,</p><p>That your Maid and the Bearer has seen me very often is very certain;
but I desire to know, being engaged at Picket, what your Letter means
by 'tis in vain to deny it. I shall stay here all the Evening.</p><p>Your amazed Cynthio.</p><p>
As soon as Robin arrived with this, Flavia answered:</p><p>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec398.txt')">Dear</a> Cynthio,</p><p>I have walked a Turn or two in my Anti-Chamber since I writ to you,
and have recovered my self from an impertinent Fit which you ought to
forgive me, and desire you would come to me immediately to laugh off a
Jealousy that you and a Creature of the Town went by in an
Hackney-Coach an Hour ago. I am Your most humble Servant,</p><p>FLAVIA.</p><p>I will not open the Letter which my Cynthio writ, upon the
Misapprehension you must have been under when you writ, for want of
hearing the whole Circumstance.</p><p>
Robin came back in an Instant, and Cynthio answered:</p><p>
Half Hour, six Minutes after Three,</p><p>June 4. Will's Coffee-house.</p><p>Madam, It is certain I went by your Lodgings with a Gentlewoman to
whom I have the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec398.txt')">Honour</a> to be known, she is indeed my Relation, and a
pretty sort of Woman. But your starting <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec398.txt')">Manner</a> of Writing, and owning
you have not done me the Honour so much as to open my Letter, has in
it something very unaccountable, and alarms one that has had Thoughts
of passing his Days with you. But I am born to admire you with all
your little Imperfections.</p><p>CYNTHIO.</p><p>
Robin run back, and brought for Answer;</p><p>
Exact Sir, that are at Will's Coffee-house six Minutes after Three,
June 4; one that has had Thoughts and all my little Imperfections.
Sir, come to me immediately, or I shall determine what may perhaps not
be very pleasing to you.
FLAVIA.</p><p>
Robin gave an Account that she looked excessive angry when she gave him
the Letter; and that he told her, for she asked, that Cynthio only
looked at the Clock, taking Snuff, and writ two or three Words on the
Top of the Letter when he gave him his.</p><p>Now the Plot thickened so well, as that Cynthio saw he had not much more
to do to accomplish being irreconciliably banished, he writ,</p><p>
Madam,
I have that Prejudice in Favour of all you do, that it is not possible
for you to determine upon what will not be very pleasing to Your
Obedient Servant,
CYNTHIO.</p><p>
This was delivered, and the Answer returned, in a little more than two
Seconds.</p><p>SIR,
Is it come to this? You never loved me; and the Creature you were with
is the properest Person for your Associate. I despise you, and hope I
shall soon hate you as a Villain to
The Credulous Flavia.</p><p>
Robin ran back, with</p><p>
Madam,
Your Credulity when you are to gain your Point, and Suspicion when you
fear to lose it make it a very hard Part to behave as becomes Your
humble Slave,
CYNTHIO.</p><p>
Robin whipt away, and returned with,</p><p>
Mr. Wellford,
Flavia and Cynthio are no more. I relieve you from the hard Part of
which you complain, and banish you from my Sight for ever.
Ann Heart.</p><p>
Robin had a Crown for his Afternoon's Work; and this is published to
admonish Cecilia to avenge the Injury done to Flavia.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
