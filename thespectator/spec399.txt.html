<p>No. 399.               Saturday, June 7, 1712.                 Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Ut nemo in sese tentat descendere!'</p><p>Pers.</p><p></p><p>Hypocrisie, at the fashionable End of the Town, is very different from
Hypocrisie in the City. The modish Hypocrite endeavours to appear more
<a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec399.txt')">vicious</a> than he really is, the other kind of Hypocrite more <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec399.txt')">virtuous</a>.
The former is afraid of every thing that has the Shew of <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec399.txt')">Religion</a> in it,
and would be thought engaged in many <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec399.txt')">Criminal</a> Gallantries and Amours,
which he is not <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec399.txt')">guilty</a> of. The latter assumes a Face of Sanctity, and
covers a Multitude of Vices under a seeming <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec399.txt')">Religious</a> Deportment.</p><p>But there is another kind of Hypocrisie, which differs from both these,
and which I intend to make the Subject of this Paper: I mean that
Hypocrisie, by which a Man does not only deceive the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec399.txt')">World</a>, but very
often imposes on himself; That Hypocrisie, which conceals his own Heart
from him, and makes him believe he is more virtuous than he really is,
and either not attend to his Vices, or mistake even his Vices for
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec399.txt')">Virtues</a>. It is this fatal Hypocrisie and Self-deceit, which is taken
notice of in those <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec399.txt')">Words</a>, Who can understand his Errors? cleanse thou me
from <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec399.txt')">secret</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec399.txt')">Faults</a>. [1]</p><p>If the open Professors of Impiety deserve the utmost Application and
Endeavours of Moral Writers to recover them from <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec399.txt')">Vice</a> and Folly, how
much more may those lay a Claim to their Care and Compassion, who are
walking in the Paths of Death, while they fancy themselves engaged in a
Course of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec399.txt')">Virtue</a>! I shall endeavour, therefore, to lay down some Rules
for the Discovery of those Vices that lurk in the secret Corners of the
Soul, and to show my Reader those Methods by which he may arrive at a
true and impartial Knowledge of himself. The usual Means prescribed for
this Purpose, are to examine our selves by the Rules which are laid down
for our Direction in Sacred Writ, and to compare our Lives with the Life
of that Person who acted up to the Perfection of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec399.txt')">Human</a> Nature, and is
the standing Example, as well as the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec399.txt')">great</a> Guide and Instructor, of
those who receive his Doctrines. Though these two Heads cannot be too
much insisted upon, I shall but just mention them, since they have been
handled by many Great and Eminent Writers.</p><p>I would therefore propose the following Methods to the Consideration of
such as would find out their secret Faults, and make a true Estimate of
themselves.</p><p>In the first Place, let them consider well what are the Characters which
they bear among their Enemies. Our Friends very often flatter us, as
much as our own Hearts. They either do not see our Faults, or conceal
them from us, or soften them by their Representations, after such a
manner, that we think them too trivial to be taken notice of. An
Adversary, on the contrary, makes a stricter Search into us, discovers
every Flaw and Imperfection in our Tempers, and though his Malice may
set them in too strong a Light, it has generally some Ground for what it
advances. A Friend exaggerates a Man's Virtues, an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec399.txt')">Enemy</a> inflames his
Crimes. A Wise Man should give a just Attention to both of them, so far
as they may tend to the Improvement of the one, and Diminution of the
other. Plutarch has written an Essay on the Benefits which a Man may
receive from his Enemies, [2] and, among the good Fruits of Enmity,
mentions this in particular, that by the Reproaches which it casts upon
us we see the worst side of our selves, and open our Eyes to several
Blemishes and Defects in our Lives and Conversations, which we should
not have observed, without the Help of such <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec399.txt')">ill</a>-natured Monitors.</p><p>In order likewise to come at a true Knowledge of our selves, we should
consider on the other hand how far we may deserve the Praises and
Approbations which the World bestow upon us: whether the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec399.txt')">Actions</a> they
celebrate proceed from laudable and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec399.txt')">worthy</a> Motives; and how far we are
really possessed of the Virtues which gain us Applause among those with
whom we converse. Such a Reflection is absolutely necessary, if we
consider how apt we are either to value or condemn ourselves by the
Opinions of others, and to sacrifice the Report of our own Hearts to the
Judgment of the World.</p><p>In the next Place, that we may not deceive our selves in a Point of so
much Importance, we should not lay too great a Stress on any supposed
Virtues we possess that are of a doubtful Nature: And such we may esteem
all those in which Multitudes of Men dissent from us, who are as good
and wise as our selves. We should always act with great Cautiousness and
Circumspection in Points, where it is not impossible that we may be
deceived. Intemperate Zeal, Bigotry and Persecution for any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec399.txt')">Party</a> or
Opinion, how praiseworthy soever they may appear to weak Men of our own
Principles, produce infinite Calamities among Mankind, and are highly
Criminal in their own Nature; and yet how many Persons eminent for Piety
suffer such monstrous and absurd Principles of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec399.txt')">Action</a> to take Root in
their Minds under the Colour of Virtues? For my own Part, I must own I
never yet knew any Party so just and reasonable, that a Man could follow
it in its Height and Violence, and at the same time be innocent.</p><p>We should likewise be very apprehensive of those Actions which proceed
from natural Constitution, favourite <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec399.txt')">Passions</a>, particular Education, or
whatever promotes our worldly Interest or Advantage. In these and the
like Cases, a Man's Judgment is easily perverted, and a wrong Bias hung
upon his Mind. These are the Inlets of Prejudice, the unguarded Avenues
of the Mind, by which a thousand Errors and secret Faults find
Admission, without being observed or taken Notice of. A wise Man will
suspect those Actions to which he is directed by something [besides [3]]
Reason, and always apprehend some concealed Evil in every Resolution
that is of a disputable Nature, when it is conformable to his particular
Temper, his Age, or Way of Life, or when it favours his Pleasure or his
Profit.</p><p>There is nothing of greater Importance to us than thus diligently to
sift our Thoughts, and examine all these dark Recesses of the Mind, if
we would establish our Souls in such a solid and substantial Virtue as
will turn to Account in that great Day, when it must stand the Test of
infinite Wisdom and Justice.</p><p>I shall conclude this Essay with observing that the two kinds of
Hypocrisie I have here spoken of, namely that of deceiving the World,
and that of imposing on our selves, are touched with wonderful Beauty in
the hundred and thirty ninth Psalm. The Folly of the first kind of
Hypocrisie is there set forth by Reflections on <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec399.txt')">God</a>'s Omniscience and
Omnipresence, which are celebrated in as noble Strains of Poetry as any
other I ever met with, either Sacred or Profane. The other kind of
Hypocrisie, whereby a Man deceives himself, is intimated in the two last
Verses, where the Psalmist addresses himself to the great Searcher of
Hearts in that emphatical Petition; Try me, O God, and seek the ground
of my heart; prove me, and examine my Thoughts. Look well if there be
any way of wickedness in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</p><p>L.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Psalm xix. 12.]</p><p>
