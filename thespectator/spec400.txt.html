<p>No. 400.               Monday, June 9, 1712.                   Steele.</p><p></p><p>'--Latet Anguis in Herba.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>It should, methinks, preserve Modesty and its Interests in the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec400.txt')">World</a>,
that the Transgression of it always creates Offence; and the very
Purposes of Wantonness are defeated by a Carriage which has in it so
much Boldness, as to intimate that Fear and Reluctance are quite
extinguishd in an Object which would be otherwise desirable. It was said
of a Wit of the last Age,</p><p>Sedley has that prevailing gentle Art,      }
Which, can with a resistless Charm impart   }
The loosest Wishes to the chastest <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec400.txt')">Heart</a>;   }
Raise such a Conflict, kindle such a Fire,
Between declining Virtue and Desire,
That the poor vanquished Maid dissolves away
In Dreams all Night, in Sighs and Tears all Day. [1]</p><p>This prevailing gentle Art was made up of Complaisance, Courtship, and
artful Conformity to the Modesty of a <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec400.txt')">Woman</a>'s Manners. Rusticity, broad
Expression, and forward Obtrusion, offend those of Education, and make
the Transgressors odious to all who have <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec400.txt')">Merit</a> enough to attract Regard.
It is in this Taste that the Scenery is so beautifully ordered in the
Description which Antony makes, in the Dialogue between him and
Dolabella, of Cleopatra in her Barge.</p><p>Her Galley down the Silver Cydnos row'd;
The Tackling Silk, the Streamers wav'd with Gold;
The gentle Winds were lodg'd in purple Sails:
Her Nymphs, like Nereids, <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec400.txt')">round</a> her Couch were placed,
Where she, another Sea-born Venus, lay;
She lay, and lean'd her Cheek upon her Hand,
And cast a Look so languishingly <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec400.txt')">sweet</a>,
As if, secure of all Beholders Hearts,
Neglecting she could take 'em. Boys like Cupids
Stood fanning with their painted Wings the Winds
That play'd about her Face; but if she smil'd,
A darting <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec400.txt')">Glory</a> seemed to blaze abroad,
That Men's desiring Eyes were never weary'd,
But hung upon the Object. To soft Flutes
The Silver Oars kept Time; and while they play'd,
The Hearing gave new Pleasure to the Sight,
And both to Thought [2]--</p><p>Here the Imagination is warmed with all the Objects presented, and yet
there is nothing that is luscious, or what raises any Idea more loose
than that of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec400.txt')">beautiful</a> Woman set off to Advantage. The like, or a more
delicate and careful Spirit of Modesty, appears in the following Passage
in one of Mr. Philip's Pastorals. [3]</p><p>'Breathe soft ye Winds, ye Waters gently flow,
Shield her ye <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec400.txt')">Trees</a>, ye <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec400.txt')">Flowers</a> around her grow,
Ye Swains, I beg you, pass in Silence by,
My <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec400.txt')">Love</a> in yonder Vale asleep does lie.'</p><p>Desire is corrected when there is a Tenderness or Admiration expressed
which partakes the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec400.txt')">Passion</a>. Licentious Language has something brutal in
it, which disgraces Humanity, and leaves us in the Condition of the
Savages in the Field. But it may be askd to what good Use can tend a
Discourse of this Kind at all? It is to alarm chaste Ears against such
as have what is above called the prevailing gentle Art. Masters of that
Talent are capable of cloathing their Thoughts in so soft a Dress, and
something so distant from the secret Purpose of their Heart, that the
Imagination of the Unguarded is touched with a Fondness which grows too
insensibly to be resisted. Much Care and Concern for the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec400.txt')">Lady</a>'s Welfare,
to seem afraid lest she should be annoyed by the very Air which
surrounds her, and this uttered rather with kind Looks, and expressed by
an Interjection, an Ah, or an Oh, at some little Hazard in moving or
making a Step, than in my direct Profession of Love, are the Methods of
skilful Admirers: They are honest Arts when their Purpose is such, but
infamous when misapplied. It is certain that many a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec400.txt')">young</a> Woman in this
Town has had her Heart irrecoverably won, by Men who have not made one
Advance which ties their Admirers, tho' the Females languish with the
utmost Anxiety. I have often, by way of Admonition to my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec400.txt')">female</a> Readers,
give them Warning against <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec400.txt')">agreeable</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec400.txt')">Company</a> of the other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec400.txt')">Sex</a>, except
they are well acquainted with their Characters. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec400.txt')">Women</a> may disguise it if
they think fit, and the more to do it, they may be angry at me for
saying it; but I say it is natural to them, that they have no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec400.txt')">Manner</a> of
Approbation of Men, without some Degree of Love: For this Reason he is
dangerous to be entertaind as a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec400.txt')">Friend</a> or Visitant who is capable of
gaining any eminent Esteem or Observation, though it be never so remote
from Pretensions as a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec400.txt')">Lover</a>. If a Man's Heart has not the Abhorrence of
any treacherous Design, he may easily improve Approbation into Kindness,
and Kindness into Passion. There may possibly be no manner of Love
between them in the Eyes of all their Acquaintance, no it is all
Friendship; and yet they may be as fond as Shepherd and Shepherdess in a
Pastoral, but still the Nymph and the Swain may be to each other no
other I warrant you, than Pylades and Orestes.</p><p>When Lucy decks with Flowers her swelling Breast,
And on her Elbow leans, dissembling Rest,
Unable to refrain my madding Mind,
Nor Sleep nor Pasture worth my Care I find.</p><p>Once Delia slept, on easie Moss reclin'd,
Her lovely Limbs half bare, and rude the Wind;
I smoothed her Coats, and stole a silent Kiss:
Condemn me Shepherds if I did amiss. [4]</p><p>Such good Offices as these, and such friendly Thoughts and Concerns for
one another, are what make up the Amity, as they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec400.txt')">call</a> it, between Man
and Woman.</p><p>It is the Permission of such Intercourse, that makes a young Woman come
to the Arms of her Husband, after the Disappointment of four or five
Passions which she has successively had for different Men, before she is
prudentially given to him for whom she has neither Love nor Friendship.
For what should a poor Creature do that has lost all her Friends?
There's Marinet the Agreeable, has, to my Knowledge, had a Friendship
for Lord Welford, which had like to break her Heart; then she had so
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec400.txt')">great</a> a Friendship for Colonel Hardy, that she could not endure any
Woman else should do any thing but rail at him. Many and fatal have been
Disasters between Friends who have fallen out, and their Resentments are
more keen than ever those of other Men can possibly be: But in this it
happens unfortunately, that as there ought to be nothing concealed from
one Friend to another, the Friends of different Sexes [very often [5]]
find fatal Effects from their Unanimity.</p><p>For my Part, who study to pass Life in as much Innocence and Tranquility
as I can, I shun the Company of agreeable Women as much as possible; and
must confess that I have, though a tolerable good Philosopher, but a low
Opinion of Platonick Love: for which Reason I thought it necessary to
give my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec400.txt')">fair</a> Readers a Caution against it, having, to my great Concern,
observed the Waste of a Platonist lately swell to a Roundness which is
inconsistent with that Philosophy.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Rochester's 'Allusion to the 10th Satire of the 1st Book of
