<p>No. 402.                Wednesday, June 11, 1712.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>[--qu√¶
Spectator tradit sibi--</p><p>Hor. [1]]</p><p></p><p>Were I to publish all the Advertisements I receive from different Hands,
and Persons of different Circumstances and Quality, the very Mention of
them, without Reflections on the several Subjects, would raise all the
Passions which can be felt by human Mind[s], As Instances of this, I
shall give you two or three Letters; the Writers of which can have no
Recourse to any legal Power for Redress, and seem to have written rather
to vent their <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec402.txt')">Sorrow</a> than to receive Consolation.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a young <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec402.txt')">Woman</a> of Beauty and Quality, and suitably <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec402.txt')">married</a> to a
Gentleman who doats on me. But this Person of mine is the Object of an
unjust Passion in a Nobleman who is very intimate with my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec402.txt')">Husband</a>.
This Friendship gives him very easie Access, and frequent
Opportunities of entertaining me apart. My <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec402.txt')">Heart</a> is in the utmost
Anguish, and my Face is covered over with Confusion, when I impart to
you another Circumstance, which is, that my Mother, the most mercenary
of all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec402.txt')">Women</a>, is gained by this false <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec402.txt')">Friend</a> of my Husband to sollicit
me for him. I am frequently chid by the poor believing Man my Husband,
for shewing an Impatience of his Friend's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec402.txt')">Company</a>; and I am never
alone with my Mother, but she tells me Stories of the discretionary
Part of the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec402.txt')">World</a>, and such a one, and such a one who are guilty of as
much as she advises me to. She laughs at my Astonishment; and seems to
hint to me, that as virtuous as she has always appeared, I am not the
Daughter of her Husband. It is possible that printing this Letter may
relieve me from the unnatural Importunity of my Mother, and the
perfidious Courtship of my Husband's Friend. I have an unfeigned <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec402.txt')">Love</a>
of Virtue, and am resolved to preserve my Innocence. The only Way I
can think of to avoid the fatal Consequences of the Discovery of this
Matter, is to fly away for ever; which I must do to avoid my Husband's
fatal Resentment against the Man who attempts to abuse him, and the
Shame of exposing the Parent to Infamy. The Persons concerned will
know these Circumstances relate to 'em; and though the Regard to
Virtue is dead in them, I have some Hopes from their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec402.txt')">Fear</a> of Shame
upon reading this in your Paper; which I conjure you to do, if you
have any Compassion for Injured Virtue.</p><p>Sylvia.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am the Husband of a Woman of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec402.txt')">Merit</a>, but am fallen in Love, as they
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec402.txt')">call</a> it, with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec402.txt')">Lady</a> of her Acquaintance, who is going to be married
to a Gentleman who deserves her. I am in a Trust relating to this
Lady's Fortune, which makes my Concurrence in this Matter necessary;
but I have so irresistible a Rage and Envy rise in me when I consider
his future Happiness, that against all Reason, Equity, and common
Justice, I am ever playing mean Tricks to suspend the Nuptials. I have
no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec402.txt')">manner</a> of Hopes for my self; Emilia, for so I'll call her, is a
Woman of the most strict Virtue; her Lover is a Gentleman who of all
others I could wish my Friend; but Envy and Jealousie, though placed
so unjustly, waste my very Being, and with the Torment and Sense of a
Daemon, I am ever cursing what I cannot but approve. I wish it were
the Beginning of Repentance, that I sit down and describe my present
Disposition with so hellish an Aspect; but at present the Destruction
of these two excellent Persons would be more welcome to me than their
Happiness. Mr. SPECTATOR, pray let me have a Paper on these terrible
groundless Sufferings, and do all you can to exorcise Crowds who are
in some Degree possessed as I am.</p><p>Canniball.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I have no other Means but this to express my Thanks to one Man, and my
Resentment against another. My Circumstances are as follows. I have
been for five Years last past courted by a Gentleman of greater
Fortune than I ought to expect, as the Market for Women goes. You must
to be sure have observed <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec402.txt')">People</a> who live in that sort of Way, as all
their Friends reckon it will be a Match, and are marked out by all the
World for each other. In this View we have been regarded for some
Time, and I have above these three Years loved him tenderly. As he is
very careful of his Fortune, I always thought he lived in a near
Manner to lay up what he thought was wanting in my Fortune to make up
what he might expect in another. Within few Months I have observed his
Carriage very much altered, and he has affected a certain Air of
getting me alone, and talking with a mighty Profusion of passionate
Words, How I am not to be resisted longer, how irresistible his Wishes
are, and the like. As long as I have been acquainted with him, I could
not on such Occasions say down-right to him, You know you may make me
yours when you please. But the other Night he with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec402.txt')">great</a> Frankness and
Impudence explained to me, that he thought of me only as a Mistress. I
answered this Declaration as it deserv'd; upon which he only doubled
the Terms on which he proposed my yielding. When my Anger heightned
upon him, he told me he was sorry he had made so little Use of the
unguarded Hours we had been together so remote from Company, as
indeed, continued he, so we are at present. I flew from him to a
neighbouring Gentlewoman's House, and tho' her Husband was in the
Room, threw my self on a Couch, and burst into a Passion of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec402.txt')">Tears</a>. My
Friend desired her Husband to leave the Room. But, said he, there is
something so extraordinary in this, that I will partake in the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec402.txt')">Affliction</a>; and be it what it will, she is so much your Friend, that
she knows she may command what Services I can do her. The Man sate
down by me, and spoke so like a Brother, that I told him my whole
Affliction. He spoke of the Injury done me with so much Indignation,
and animated me against the Love he said he saw I had for the Wretch
who would have betrayed me, with so much Reason and Humanity to my
Weakness, that I doubt not of my Perseverance. His <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec402.txt')">Wife</a> and he are my
Comforters, and I am under no more Restraint in their Company than if
I were alone; and I doubt not but in a small time Contempt and Hatred
will take Place of the Remains of Affection to a Rascal.</p><p>I am</p><p>SIR,</p><p>Your affectionate Reader,</p><p>Dorinda.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I had the Misfortune to be an Uncle before I knew my Nephews from my
Nieces, and now we are grown up to better Acquaintance they deny me
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec402.txt')">Respect</a> they owe. One upbraids me with being their Familiar,
another will hardly be perswaded that I am an Uncle, a third calls me
Little Uncle, and a fourth tells me there is no Duty at all due to an
Uncle. I have a Brother-in-law whose Son will win all my Affection,
unless you shall think this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec402.txt')">worthy</a> of your Cognizance, and will be
pleased to prescribe some Rules for our future reciprocal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec402.txt')">Behaviour</a>.
It will be worthy the Particularity of your Genius to lay down Rules
for his Conduct who was as it were born an old Man, in which you will
much oblige,</p><p>Sir,</p><p>Your most obedient Servant,</p><p>Cornelius Nepos.</p><p>
T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: No motto in the first issue.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
