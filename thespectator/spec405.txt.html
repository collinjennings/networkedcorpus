<p>No. 405.                Saturday, June 14, 1712.                Addison.</p><p></p><p>[Greek:
Oi dè panaemérioi molpàe theòn hiláskonto,
Kalòn aeídontes paiáeona kouroi Achaiôn,
Mélpontes Ekáergon. Ho dè phréna térpet akoúôn.]</p><p>Hom.</p><p></p><p>I am very sorry to find, by the <a name="topic47" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec405.txt')">Opera</a> Bills for this Day, that we are
likely to lose the greatest Performer in Dramatick <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec405.txt')">Musick</a> that is now
living, or that perhaps ever appeared upon a Stage. I need not acquaint
my Reader, that I am speaking of Signior Nicolini. [1] The Town is
highly obliged to that Excellent Artist, for having shewn us the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec405.txt')">Italian</a>
Musick in its Perfection, as well as for that generous Approbation he
lately gave to an Opera of our own Country, in which the Composer
endeavoured to do Justice to the Beauty of the <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec405.txt')">Words</a>, by following that
Noble Example, which has been set him by the greatest Foreign Masters in
that Art.</p><p>I could heartily wish there was the same Application and Endeavours to
cultivate and improve our <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec405.txt')">Church</a>-Musick, as have been lately bestowed on
that of the Stage. Our Composers have one very <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec405.txt')">great</a> Incitement to it:
They are sure to meet with Excellent Words, and, at the same time, a
wonderful Variety of them. There is no Passion that is not finely
expressed in those parts of the inspired Writings, which are proper for
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec405.txt')">Divine</a> Songs and Anthems.</p><p>There is a certain Coldness and Indifference in the Phrases of our
European Languages, when they are compared with the Oriental Forms of
Speech: and it happens very luckily, that the Hebrew Idioms run into the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec405.txt')">English</a> Tongue with a particular Grace and Beauty. Our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec405.txt')">Language</a> has
received innumerable Elegancies and Improvements, from that Infusion of
Hebraisms, which are derived to it out of the Poetical Passages in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec405.txt')">Holy</a>
Writ. They give a Force and Energy to our Expressions, warm and animate
our Language, and convey our Thoughts in more ardent and intense
Phrases, than any that are to be met with in our own Tongue. There is
something so pathetick in this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec405.txt')">kind</a> of Diction, that it often sets the
Mind in a Flame, and makes our Hearts burn within us. How cold and dead
does a Prayer appear, that is composed in the most Elegant and Polite
Forms of Speech, which are natural to our Tongue, when it is not
heightened by that Solemnity of Phrase, which may be drawn from the
Sacred Writings. It has been said by some of the Ancients, that if the
Gods were to talk with Men, they would certainly <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec405.txt')">speak</a> in Plato's Style;
but I think we may say, with Justice, that when Mortals converse with
their Creator, they cannot do it in so proper a Style as in that of the
Holy Scriptures.</p><p>If any one would judge of the Beauties of Poetry that are to be met with
in the Divine Writings, and examine how kindly the Hebrew Manners of
Speech mix and incorporate with the English Language; after having
perused the Book of Psalms, let him read a literal Translation of Horace
or Pindar. He will find in these two last such an Absurdity and
Confusion of Style, with such a Comparative Poverty of Imagination, as
will make him very sensible of what I have been here advancing.</p><p>Since we have therefore such a Treasury of Words, so beautiful in
themselves, and so proper for the Airs of Musick, I cannot but wonder
that Persons of Distinction should give so little Attention and
Encouragement to that Kind of Musick, which would have its Foundation in
Reason, and which would improve our Virtue in proportion as it raised
our Delight. The Passions that are excited by ordinary Compositions
generally flow from such silly and absurd Occasions, that a Man is
ashamed to reflect upon them seriously; but the Fear, the Love, the
Sorrow, the Indignation that are awakened in the Mind by Hymns and
Anthems, make the Heart better, and proceed from such Causes as are
altogether reasonable and praise-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec405.txt')">worthy</a>. Pleasure and Duty go hand in
hand, and the greater our Satisfaction is, the greater is our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec405.txt')">Religion</a>.</p><p>Musick among those who were styled the chosen <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec405.txt')">People</a> was a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec405.txt')">Religious</a>
Art. The Songs of Sion, which we have reason to believe were in high
Repute among the Courts of the Eastern Monarchs, were nothing else but
Psalms and Pieces of Poetry that adored or celebrated the Supreme Being.
The greatest Conqueror in this Holy Nation, after the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec405.txt')">manner</a> of the old
Grecian Lyricks, did not only compose the Words of his Divine Odes, but
generally set them to Musick himself: After which, his Works, tho' they
were consecrated to the Tabernacle, became the National Entertainment,
as well as the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec405.txt')">Devotion</a> of his People.</p><p>The first Original of the Drama was a Religious <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec405.txt')">Worship</a> consisting only
of a Chorus, which was nothing else but an Hymn to a Deity. As Luxury
and Voluptuousness prevailed over Innocence and Religion, this Form of
Worship degenerated into Tragedies; in which however the Chorus so far
remembered its first Office, as to brand every thing that was vicious,
and recommend every thing that was laudable, to intercede with Heaven
for the Innocent, and to implore its Vengeance on the Criminal.</p><p>Homer and Hesiod intimate to us how this Art should be applied, when
they represent the Muses as surrounding Jupiter, and warbling their
Hymns about his Throne. I might shew from innumerable Passages in
Ancient <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec405.txt')">Writers</a>, not only that Vocal and Instrumental Musick were made
use of in their Religious Worship, but that their most favourite
Diversions were filled with Songs and Hymns to their respective Deities.
Had we frequent Entertainments of this Nature among us, they would not a
little purifie and exalt our Passions, give our Thoughts a proper Turn,
and cherish those Divine Impulses in the Soul, which every one feels
that has not stifled them by sensual and immoderate Pleasures.</p><p>Musick, when thus applied, raises noble Hints in the Mind of the Hearer,
and fills it with great Conceptions. It strengthens Devotion, and
advances Praise into Rapture. It lengthens out every Act of Worship, and
produces more lasting and permanent Impressions in the Mind, than those
which accompany any transient Form of Words that are uttered in the
ordinary Method of Religious Worship.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: See note on p. 51, vol. i [Footnote 1 of No. 13]. He took
