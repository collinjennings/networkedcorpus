<p>No. 407.                  Tuesday, June 17, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--abest facundis Gratia dictis.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>Most Foreign <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec407.txt')">Writers</a> who have given any Character of the <a name="topic47" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec407.txt')">English</a> Nation,
whatever Vices they ascribe to it, allow in general, that the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec407.txt')">People</a> are
naturally Modest. It proceeds perhaps from this our National Virtue,
that our Orators are observed to make use of less Gesture or Action than
those of other Countries. Our Preachers stand stock-still in the Pulpit,
and will not so much as move a Finger to set off the best Sermons in the
World. We meet with the same speaking Statues at our Bars, and in all
publick Places of Debate. Our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec407.txt')">Words</a> flow from us in a smooth continued
Stream, without those Strainings of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec407.txt')">Voice</a>, Motions of the Body, and
Majesty of the Hand, which are so much celebrated in the Orators of
Greece and Rome. We can talk of Life and Death in cold Blood, and keep
our Temper in a Discourse which turns upon every thing that is dear to
us. Though our Zeal breaks out in the finest Tropes and Figures, it is
not able to stir a Limb about us. I have heard it observed more than
once by those who have seen Italy, that an untravelled Englishman cannot
relish all the Beauties of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec407.txt')">Italian</a> Pictures, because the Postures which
are expressed in them are often such as are peculiar to that Country.
One who has not seen an Italian in the Pulpit, will not know what to
make of that noble Gesture in Raphael's Picture of St. Paul preaching at
Athens, where the Apostle is represented as lifting up both his Arms,
and pouring out the Thunder of his Rhetorick amidst an Audience of Pagan
Philosophers.</p><p>It is certain that proper Gestures and vehement Exertions of the Voice
cannot be too much studied by a publick Orator. They are a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec407.txt')">kind</a> of
Comment to what he utters, and enforce every thing he says, with weak
Hearers, better than the strongest Argument he can make use of. They
keep the Audience awake, and fix their Attention to what is delivered to
them, at the same time that they shew the Speaker is in earnest, and
affected himself with what he so passionately recommends to others.
Violent Gesture and Vociferation naturally shake the Hearts of the
Ignorant, and fill them with a kind of <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec407.txt')">Religious</a> Horror. Nothing is more
frequent than to see Women weep and tremble at the Sight of a moving
Preacher, though he is placed quite out of their Hearing; as in England
we very frequently see People lulled asleep with solid and elaborate
Discourses of Piety, who would be warmed and transported out of
themselves by the Bellowings and Distortions of Enthusiasm.</p><p>If Nonsense, when accompanied with such an Emotion of Voice and Body,
has such an Influence on Men's Minds, what might we not expect from many
of those Admirable Discourses which are printed in our Tongue, were they
delivered with a becoming Fervour, and with the most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec407.txt')">agreeable</a> Graces of
Voice and Gesture?</p><p>We are told that the great Latin Orator very much impaired his Health by
this laterum contentio, this Vehemence of Action, with which he used to
deliver himself. The Greek Orator was likewise so very Famous for this
Particular in Rhetorick, that one of his Antagonists, whom he had
banished from Athens, reading over the Oration which had procured his
Banishment, and seeing his Friends admire it, could not forbear asking
them, if they were so much affected by the bare reading of it, how much
more they would have been alarmed, had they heard him actually throwing
out such a Storm of Eloquence?</p><p>How cold and dead a Figure in Comparison of these two great Men, does an
Orator often make at the British Bar, holding up his Head with the most
insipid Serenity, and streaking the sides of a long Wigg that reaches
down to his Middle? The truth of it is, there is often nothing more
ridiculous than the Gestures of an English Speaker; you see some of them
running their Hands into their Pockets as far as ever they can thrust
them, and others looking with great Attention on a piece of Paper that
has nothing written in it; you may see many a smart Rhetorician turning
his Hat in his Hands, moulding it into several different Cocks,
examining sometimes the Lining of it, and sometimes the Button, during
the whole course of his Harangue. A deaf Man would think he was
Cheap'ning a Beaver, when perhaps he is talking of the Fate of the
British Nation. I remember, when I was a young Man, and used to frequent
Westminster-Hall, there was a Counsellor who never pleaded without a
Piece of Pack-thread in his Hand, which he used to twist about a Thumb,
or a Finger, all the while he was speaking: The Waggs of those Days used
to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec407.txt')">call</a> it the Thread of his Discourse, for he was not able to utter a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec407.txt')">Word</a> without it. One of his Clients, who was more merry than wise, stole
it from him one Day in the midst of his Pleading; but he had better have
let it alone, for he lost his Cause by his Jest.</p><p>I have all along acknowledged my self to be a Dumb Man, and therefore
may be thought a very improper Person to give Rules for Oratory; but I
believe every one will agree with me in this, that we ought either to
lay aside all kinds of Gesture, (which seems to be very suitable to the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec407.txt')">Genius</a> of our Nation) or at least to make use of such only as are
graceful and expressive.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
