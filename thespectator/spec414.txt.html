<p>No. 414.                Wednesday, June 25, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>--Alterius sic
Altera poscit opem res et conjurat amicè.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>If we consider the <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec414.txt')">Works</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec414.txt')">Nature</a> and <a name="topic21" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec414.txt')">Art</a>, as they are qualified to
entertain the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec414.txt')">Imagination</a>, we shall find the last very defective, in
Comparison of the former; for though they may sometimes appear as
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec414.txt')">Beautiful</a> or Strange, they can have nothing in them of that Vastness and
Immensity, which afford so great an Entertainment to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec414.txt')">Mind</a> of the
Beholder. The one may be as Polite and Delicate as the other, but can
never shew her self so August and Magnificent in the Design. There is
something more bold and masterly in the rough careless Strokes of
Nature, than in the nice Touches and Embellishments of Art. The Beauties
of the most stately <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec414.txt')">Garden</a> or Palace lie in a narrow Compass, the
Imagination immediately runs them over, and requires something else to
gratifie her; but, in the wide <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec414.txt')">Fields</a> of Nature, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec414.txt')">Sight</a> wanders up
and down without Confinement, and is fed with an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec414.txt')">infinite</a> variety of
Images, without any certain Stint or Number. For this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec414.txt')">Reason</a> we always
find the Poet in Love with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec414.txt')">Country</a>-Life, where Nature appears in the
greatest Perfection, and furnishes out all those Scenes that are most
apt to delight the Imagination.</p><p>'Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus et fugit Urbes.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
'Hic Secura quies, et nescia fallere vita,
Dives opum variarum; hic latis otia fundis,
Speluncæ, vivique lacus, hic frigida Tempe,
Mugitusque boum, mollesque sub arbore somni.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p>But tho' there are several of these wild Scenes, that are more
delightful than any artificial Shows; yet we find the Works of Nature
still more pleasant, the more they resemble those of Art: For in this
case our Pleasure rises from a double Principle; from the Agreeableness
of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec414.txt')">Objects</a> to the Eye, and from their Similitude to other Objects:
We are pleased as well with comparing their Beauties, as with surveying
them, and can represent them to our Minds, either as Copies or
Originals. Hence it is that we take Delight in a Prospect which is well
laid out, and diversified with Fields and Meadows, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec414.txt')">Woods</a> and Rivers; in
those accidental Landskips of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec414.txt')">Trees</a>, Clouds and Cities, that are
sometimes found in the Veins of Marble; in the curious Fret-work of
Rocks and Grottos; and, in a Word, in any thing that hath such a Variety
or Regularity as may seem the Effect of Design, in what we call the
Works of Chance.</p><p>If the Products of Nature rise in Value, according as they more or less
resemble those of Art, we may be sure that artificial Works receive a
greater Advantage from their Resemblance of such as are natural; because
here the Similitude is not only pleasant, but the Pattern more perfect.
The prettiest Landskip I ever saw, was one drawn on the Walls of a dark
Room, which stood opposite on one side to a navigable River, and on the
other to a Park. The Experiment is very common in Opticks. Here you
might discover the Waves and Fluctuations of the Water in strong and
proper Colours, with the Picture of a Ship entering at one end, and
sailing by Degrees through the whole Piece. On another there appeared
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec414.txt')">Green</a> Shadows of Trees, waving to and fro with the Wind, and Herds
of Deer among them in Miniature, leaping about upon the Wall. I must
confess, the Novelty of such a Sight may be one occasion of its
Pleasantness to the Imagination, but certainly the chief Reason is its
near Resemblance to Nature, as it does not only, like other Pictures,
give the Colour and Figure, but the Motion of the Things it represents.</p><p>We have before observed, that there is generally in Nature something
more Grand and August, than what we meet with in the Curiosities of Art.
When therefore, we see this imitated in any measure, it gives us a
nobler and more exalted kind of Pleasure than what we receive from the
nicer and more accurate Productions of Art. On this Account our English
Gardens are not so entertaining to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec414.txt')">Fancy</a> as those in France and
Italy, where we see a large Extent of Ground covered over with an
agreeable mixture of Garden and Forest, which represent every where an
artificial Rudeness, much more charming than that Neatness and Elegancy
which we meet with in those of our own Country. It might, indeed, be of
ill Consequence to the Publick, as well as unprofitable to private
Persons, to alienate so much Ground from Pasturage, and the Plow, in
many Parts of a Country that is so well peopled, and cultivated to a far
greater Advantage. But why may not a whole Estate be thrown into a kind
of Garden by frequent Plantations, that may turn as much to the Profit,
as the Pleasure of the Owner? A Marsh overgrown with Willows, or a
Mountain shaded with Oaks, are not only more beautiful, but more
beneficial, than when they lie bare and unadorned. Fields of Corn make a
pleasant Prospect, and if the Walks were a little taken care of that lie
between them, if the natural Embroidery of the Meadows were helpt and
improved by some small Additions of Art, and the several Rows of Hedges
set off by Trees and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec414.txt')">Flowers</a>, that the Soil was capable of receiving, a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec414.txt')">Man</a> might make a pretty Landskip of his own Possessions.</p><p>Writers who have given us an Account of China, tell us the Inhabitants
of that Country laugh at the Plantations of our Europeans, which are
laid out by the Rule and Line; because, they say, any one may place
Trees in equal Rows and uniform Figures. They chuse rather to shew a
Genius in Works of this Nature, and therefore always conceal the Art by
which they direct themselves. They have a Word, it seems, in their
Language, by which they express the particular Beauty of a Plantation
that thus strikes the Imagination at first Sight, without discovering
what it is that has so agreeable an Effect. Our British Gardeners, on
the contrary, instead of humouring Nature, love to deviate from it as
much as possible. Our Trees rise in Cones, Globes, and Pyramids. We see
the Marks of the Scissars upon every Plant and Bush. I do not know
whether I am singular in my Opinion, but, for my own part, I would
rather look upon a Tree in all its Luxuriancy and Diffusion of Boughs
and Branches, than when it is thus cut and trimmed into a Mathematical
Figure; and cannot but fancy that an Orchard in Flower looks infinitely
more delightful, than all the little Labyrinths of the [more [1]]
finished Parterre. But as our great Modellers of Gardens have their
Magazines of Plants to dispose of, it is very natural for them to tear
up all the beautiful Plantations of Fruit Trees, and contrive a Plan
that may most turn to their own Profit, in taking off their Evergreens,
and the like Moveable Plants, with which their Shops are plentifully
stocked.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [most]]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
