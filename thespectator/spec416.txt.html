<p>No. 416.                Friday, June 27, 1712.                 Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Quaten√ªs hoc simile est oculis, quod mente videmus.'</p><p>Lucr.</p><p></p><p>I at first divided the <a name="topic21" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec416.txt')">Pleasures</a> of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec416.txt')">Imagination</a>, into such as arise
from <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec416.txt')">Objects</a> that are actually before our Eyes, or that once entered in
at our Eyes, and are afterwards called up into the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec416.txt')">Mind</a> either barely by
its own Operations, or on occasion of something without us, as Statues,
or Descriptions. We have already considered the first Division, and
shall therefore enter on the other, which for Distinction sake, I have
called the Secondary Pleasures of the Imagination. When I say the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec416.txt')">Ideas</a>
we receive from Statues, Descriptions, or such like Occasions, are the
same that were once actually in our View, it must not be understood that
we had once see the very Place, Action, or Person which are carved or
described. It is sufficient, that we have seen Places, Persons, or
Actions, in general, which bear a Resemblance, or at least some remote
Analogy with what we find represented. Since it is in the Power of the
Imagination, when it is once Stocked with particular Ideas, to enlarge,
compound, and vary them at her own Pleasure.</p><p>Among the different Kinds of Representation, Statuary is the most
natural, and shews us something likest the Object that is represented.
To make use of a common Instance, let one who is born Blind take an
Image in his Hands, and trace out with his Fingers the different Furrows
and Impressions of the Chissel, and he will easily conceive how the
Shape of a <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec416.txt')">Man</a>, or Beast, may be represented by it; but should he draw
his Hand over a Picture, where all is smooth and uniform, he would never
be able to imagine how the several Prominencies and Depressions of a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec416.txt')">human</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec416.txt')">Body</a> could be shewn on a plain Piece of Canvas, that has in it no
Unevenness or Irregularity. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec416.txt')">Description</a> runs yet further from the Things
it represents than Painting; for a Picture bears a real Resemblance to
its Original, which Letters and Syllables are wholly void of. Colours
speak of Languages, but <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec416.txt')">Words</a> are understood only by such a People or
Nation. For this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec416.txt')">Reason</a>, tho' Men's Necessities quickly put them on
finding out Speech, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec416.txt')">Writing</a> is probably of a later invention than
Painting; particularly we are told, that in America when the Spaniards
first arrived there Expresses were sent to the Emperor of Mexico in
Paint, and the News of his Country delineated by the Strokes of a
Pencil, which was a more natural Way than that of Writing, tho' at the
same time much more imperfect, because it is impossible to draw the
little Connexions of Speech, or to give the Picture of a Conjunction or
an Adverb. It would be yet more strange, to represent visible Objects by
Sounds that have no Ideas annexed to them, and to make something like
Description in Musick. Yet it is certain, there may be confused,
imperfect Notions of this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec416.txt')">Nature</a> raised in the Imagination by an
Artificial Composition of Notes; and we find that great Masters in the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec416.txt')">Art</a> are able, sometimes, to set their Hearers in the Heat and Hurry of a
Battel, to overcast their Minds with melancholy Scenes and Apprehensions
of Deaths and Funerals, or to lull them into pleasing Dreams of Groves
and Elisiums.</p><p>In all these Instances, this Secondary Pleasure of the Imagination
proceeds from that Action of the Mind, which compares the Ideas arising
from the Original Objects, with the Ideas we receive from the Statue,
Picture, Description, or Sound that represents them. It is impossible
for us to give the necessary Reason, why this Operation of the Mind is
attended with so much Pleasure, as I have before observed on the same
Occasion; but we find a great Variety of Entertainments derived from
this single Principle: For it is this that not only gives us a Relish of
Statuary, Painting and Description, but makes us delight in all the
Actions and Arts of Mimickry. It is this that makes the several kinds of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec416.txt')">Wit</a> Pleasant, which consists, as I have formerly shewn, in the Affinity
of Ideas: And we may add, it is this also that raises the little
Satisfaction we sometimes find in the different Sorts of false Wit;
whether it consists in the Affinity of Letters, as in Anagram,
Acrostick; or of Syllables, as in Doggerel Rhimes, Ecchos; or of Words,
as in Punns, Quibbles; or of a whole Sentence or Poem, to Wings, and
Altars. The final Cause, probably, of annexing Pleasure to this
Operation of the Mind, was to quicken and encourage us in our Searches
after Truth, since the distinguishing one thing from another, and the
right discerning betwixt our Ideas, depends wholly upon our comparing
them together, and observing the Congruity or Disagreement that appears
among the several <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec416.txt')">Works</a> of Nature.</p><p>But I shall here confine my self to those Pleasures of the Imagination,
[which [1]] proceed from Ideas raised by Words, because most of the
Observations that agree with Descriptions, are equally Applicable to
Painting and Statuary.</p><p>Words, when well chosen, have so great a Force in them, that a
Description often gives us more lively Ideas than the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec416.txt')">Sight</a> of Things
themselves. The Reader finds a Scene drawn in stronger Colours, and
painted more to the Life in his Imagination, by the help of Words, than
by an actual Survey of the Scene which they describe. In this case the
Poet seems to get the better of Nature; he takes, indeed, the Landskip
after her, but gives it more vigorous Touches, heightens its Beauty, and
so enlivens the whole Piece, that the Images which flow from the Objects
themselves appear weak and faint, in Comparison of those that come from
the Expressions. The Reason, probably, may be, because in the Survey of
any Object we have only so much of it painted on the Imagination, as
comes in at the Eye; but in its Description, the Poet gives us as free a
View of it as he pleases, and discovers to us several Parts, that either
we did not attend to, or that lay out of our Sight when we first beheld
it. As we look on any Object, our Idea of it is, perhaps, made up of two
or three simple Ideas; but when the Poet represents it, he may either
give us a more complex Idea of it, or only raise in us such Ideas as are
most apt to affect the Imagination.</p><p>It may be here worth our while to Examine how it comes to pass that
several Readers, who are all acquainted with the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec416.txt')">Language</a>, and know
the Meaning of the Words they read, should nevertheless have a different
Relish of the same Descriptions. We find one transported with a Passage,
which another runs over with Coldness and Indifference, or finding the
Representation extreamly natural, where another can perceive nothing of
Likeness and Conformity. This different Taste must proceed, either from
the Perfection of Imagination in one more than in another, or from the
different Ideas that several Readers affix to the same Words. For, to
have a true Relish, and form a right Judgment of a Description, a Man
should be born with a good Imagination, and must have well weighed the
Force and Energy that lye in the several Words of a Language, so as to
be able to distinguish which are most significant and expressive of
their proper Ideas, and what additional Strength and Beauty they are
capable of receiving from Conjunction with others. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec416.txt')">Fancy</a> must be
warm to retain the Print of those Images it hath received from outward
Objects and the Judgment discerning, to know what Expressions are most
proper to cloath and adorn them to the best Advantage. A Man who is
deficient in either of these Respects, tho' he may receive the general
Notion of a Description, can never see distinctly all its particular
Beauties: As a Person, with a weak Sight, may have the confused Prospect
of a Place that lies before him, without entering into its several
Parts, or discerning the variety of its Colours in their full Glory and
Perfection.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [that]]</p><p></p><p></p><p>
