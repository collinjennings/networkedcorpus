<p>No. 417.                 Saturday, June 28, 1712.                  Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Quem tu Melpomene semel
Nascentem placido lumine videris,
Non illum labor Isthmius
Clarabit pugilem, non equus impiger, &c.
Sed quæ Tibur aquæ fertile perfluunt,
Et Spissæ nemorum comæ
Fingent Æolio carmine nobilem.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>We may observe, that any single Circumstance of what we have formerly
seen often raises up a whole Scene of Imagery, and awakens [numberless
[1]] <a name="topic21" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec417.txt')">Ideas</a> that before slept in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec417.txt')">Imagination</a>; such a particular Smell
or Colour is able to fill the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec417.txt')">Mind</a>, on a sudden, with the Picture of the
<a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec417.txt')">Fields</a> or Gardens, where we first met with it, and to bring up into View
all the Variety of Images that once attended it. Our Imagination takes
the Hint, and leads us unexpectedly into Cities or Theatres, Plains or
Meadows. We may further observe, when the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec417.txt')">Fancy</a> thus reflects on the
Scenes that have past in it formerly, those which were at first pleasant
to behold, appear more so upon Reflection, and that the Memory heightens
the Delightfulness of the Original. A _Cartesian_ would account for both
these Instances in the following Manner.</p><p>The Sett of Ideas, which we received from such a Prospect or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec417.txt')">Garden</a>,
having entered the Mind at the same time, have a Sett of Traces
belonging to them in the Brain, bordering very near upon one another;
when, therefore, any one of these Ideas arises in the Imagination, and
consequently dispatches a flow of Animal Spirits to its proper Trace,
these Spirits, in the Violence of their Motion, run not only into the
Trace, to which they were more particularly directed, but into several
of those that lie about it: By this means they awaken other Ideas of the
same Sett, which immediately determine a new Dispatch of Spirits, that
in the same manner open other Neighbouring Traces, till at last the
whole Sett of them is blown up, and the whole Prospect or Garden
flourishes in the Imagination. But because the Pleasure we received from
these Places far surmounted, and overcame the little Disagreeableness we
found in them; for this <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec417.txt')">Reason</a> there was at first a wider Passage worn
in the Pleasure Traces, and, on the contrary, so narrow a one in those
which belonged to the disagreeable Ideas, that they were quickly stopt
up, and rendered incapable of receiving any Animal Spirits, and
consequently of exciting any unpleasant Ideas in the Memory.</p><p>It would be in vain to enquire, whether the Power of Imagining Things
strongly proceeds from any greater Perfection in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec417.txt')">Soul</a>, or from any
nicer Texture in the Brain of one <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec417.txt')">Man</a> than of another. But this is
certain, that a noble Writer should be born with this Faculty in its
full Strength and Vigour, so as to be able to receive lively Ideas from
outward <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec417.txt')">Objects</a>, to retain them long, and to range them together, upon
Occasion, in such Figures and Representations as are most likely to hit
the Fancy of the <a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec417.txt')">Reader</a>. A <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec417.txt')">Poet</a> should take as much Pains in forming his
Imagination, as a Philosopher in cultivating his Understanding. He must
gain a due Relish of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec417.txt')">Works</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec417.txt')">Nature</a>, and be thoroughly conversant
in the various Scenary of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec417.txt')">Country</a> Life.</p><p>When he is stored with Country Images, if he would go beyond Pastoral,
and the lower kinds of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec417.txt')">Poetry</a>, he ought to acquaint himself with the
Pomp and Magnificence of Courts. He should be very well versed in every
thing that is noble and stately in the Productions of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec417.txt')">Art</a>, whether it
appear in Painting or Statuary, in the great Works of Architecture which
are in their present Glory, or in the Ruins of those [which [2]]
flourished in former Ages.</p><p>Such Advantages as these help to open a Man's Thoughts, and to enlarge
his Imagination, and will therefore have their Influence on all kinds of
Writing, if the Author knows how to make right use of them. And among
those of the learned Languages who excel in this Talent, the most
perfect in their several kinds, are perhaps _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec417.txt')">Homer</a>_, _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec417.txt')">Virgil</a>_, and
_Ovid_. The first strikes the Imagination wonderfully with what is
Great, the second with what is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec417.txt')">Beautiful</a>, and the last with what is
Strange. Reading the _Iliad_ is like travelling through a Country
uninhabited, where the Fancy is entertained with a thousand Savage
Prospects of vast Desarts, wide uncultivated Marshes, huge Forests,
mis-shapen Rocks and Precipices. On the contrary, the _Æneid_ is like a
well ordered Garden, where it is impossible to find out any Part
unadorned, or to cast our Eyes upon a single Spot, that does not produce
some beautiful Plant or Flower. But when we are in the _Metamorphoses_,
we are walking on enchanted Ground, and see nothing but Scenes of Magick
lying <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec417.txt')">round</a> us.</p><p>_Homer_ is in his Province, when he is describing a Battel or a
Multitude, a Heroe or a God. _Virgil_ is never better pleased, than when
he is in his _Elysium_, or copying out an entertaining Picture.
_Homer's_ Epithets generally mark out what is Great, _Virgil's_ what is
Agreeable. Nothing can be more Magnificent than the Figure _Jupiter_
makes in the first _Iliad_, no more Charming than that of Venus in the
first _Æneid_.</p><p>[Greek:
Ae, kaì kyanéaesin ep' ophrysi neuse Kroníôn,
Ambrósiai d' ára chaitai eperrhôsanto ánaktos
Kratòs ap' athanátoio mégan d' élélixen Ólympos.]</p><p>
Dixit et avertens roseâ cervice refulsit:
Ambrosiæque comæ; divinum vertice odorem
Spiravere: Pedes vestis defluxit ad imos:
Et vera incessu patuit Dea--</p><p>_Homer's_ Persons are most of them God-like and Terrible; _Virgil_ has
scarce admitted any into his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec417.txt')">Poem</a>, who are not Beautiful, and has taken
particular Care to make his Heroe so.</p><p>--lumenque juventæ
Purpureum, et lætos oculis afflavit honores.</p><p>In a Word, 'Homer' fills his Readers with Sublime Ideas, and, I believe,
has raised the Imagination of all the good Poets that have come after
him. I shall only instance 'Horace', who immediately takes Fire at the
first Hint of any Passage in the 'Iliad' or 'Odyssey', and always rises
above himself, when he has 'Homer' in his View. 'Virgil' has drawn
together, into his 'Æneid', all the pleasing Scenes his Subject is
capable of admitting, and in his 'Georgics' has given us a Collection of
the most delightful Landskips that can be made out of Fields and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec417.txt')">Woods</a>,
Herds of Cattle, and Swarms of Bees.</p><p>'Ovid', in his 'Metamorphoses', has shewn us how the Imagination may be
affected by what is Strange. He describes a Miracle in every Story, and
always gives us the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec417.txt')">Sight</a> of some new Creature at the end of it. His Art
consists chiefly in well-timing his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec417.txt')">Description</a>, before the first Shape
is quite worn off, and the new one perfectly finished; so that he every
where entertains us with something we never saw before, and shews
Monster after Monster, to the end of the 'Metamorphoses'.</p><p>If I were to name a Poet that is a perfect Master in all these Arts of
working on the Imagination, I think '<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec417.txt')">Milton</a>' may pass for one: And if
his '<a name="topic40" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('40', 'spec417.txt')">Paradise</a> Lost' falls short of the 'Æneid' or 'Iliad' in this
respect, it proceeds rather from the Fault of the Language in which it
is written, than from any Defect of Genius in the Author. So Divine a
Poem in 'English', is like a stately Palace built of Brick, where one
may see Architecture in as great a Perfection as in one of Marble, tho'
the Materials are of a coarser Nature. But to consider it only as it
regards our present Subject: What can be conceived greater than the
Battel of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('40', 'spec417.txt')">Angels</a>, the Majesty of Messiah, the Stature and Behaviour of
Satan and his Peers? What more beautiful than 'Pandæmonium', Paradise,
Heaven, Angels, '<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('40', 'spec417.txt')">Adam</a>' and '<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('40', 'spec417.txt')">Eve</a>'? What more strange, than the Creation
of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec417.txt')">World</a>, the several Metamorphoses of the fallen Angels, and the
surprising Adventures their Leader meets with in his Search after
Paradise? No other Subject could have furnished a Poet with Scenes so
proper to strike the Imagination, as no other Poet could have painted
those Scenes in more strong and lively Colours.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [a Thousand]]</p><p>
