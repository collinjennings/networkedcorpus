<p>No. 421.               Thursday, July 3, 1712.             Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Ignotis errare locis, ignota videre
Flumina gaudebat; studio minuente laborem.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>The <a name="topic21" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec421.txt')">Pleasures</a> of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec421.txt')">Imagination</a> are not wholly confined to such
particular <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec421.txt')">Authors</a> as are conversant in material <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec421.txt')">Objects</a>, but are often
to be met with among the Polite Masters of Morality, Criticism, and
other Speculations abstracted from Matter, who, tho' they do not
directly treat of the visible Parts of <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec421.txt')">Nature</a>, often draw from them
their Similitudes, Metaphors, and Allegories. By these Allusions a Truth
in the Understanding is as it were reflected by the Imagination; we are
able to see something like Colour and Shape in a Notion, and to discover
a Scheme of Thoughts traced out upon Matter. And here the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec421.txt')">Mind</a> receives
a great deal of Satisfaction, and has two of its Faculties gratified at
the same time, while the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec421.txt')">Fancy</a> is busie in copying after the
Understanding, and transcribing <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec421.txt')">Ideas</a> out of the Intellectual <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec421.txt')">World</a> into
the Material.</p><p>The Great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec421.txt')">Art</a> of a Writer shews it self in the Choice of pleasing
Allusions, which are generally to be taken from the _great_ or
_<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec421.txt')">beautiful</a>_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec421.txt')">Works</a> of Art or Nature; for though whatever is New or
Uncommon is apt to delight the Imagination, the chief Design of an
Allusion being to illustrate and explain the Passages of an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec421.txt')">Author</a>, it
should be always borrowed from what is more known and common, than the
Passages which are to be explained.</p><p>Allegories, when well chosen, are like so many Tracks of Light in a
Discourse, that make every thing about them clear and beautiful. A noble
Metaphor, when it is placed to an Advantage, casts a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec421.txt')">kind</a> of Glory round
it, and darts a Lustre through a whole Sentence: These different Kinds
of Allusion are but so many different Manners of Similitude, and, that
they may please the Imagination, the Likeness ought to be very exact, or
very agreeable, as we love to see a Picture where the Resemblance is
just, or the Posture and Air graceful. But we often find eminent <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec421.txt')">Writers</a>
very faulty in this respect; great Scholars are apt to fetch their
Comparisons and Allusions from the Sciences in which they are most
conversant, so that a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec421.txt')">Man</a> may see the Compass of their Learning in a
Treatise on the most indifferent Subject. I have read a Discourse upon
Love, which none but a profound Chymist could understand, and have heard
many a Sermon that should only have been preached before a Congregation
of _Cartesians_. On the contrary, your Men of Business usually have
recourse to such Instances as are too mean and familiar. They are for
drawing the Reader into a Game of Chess or Tennis, or for leading him
from Shop to Shop, in the Cant of particular Trades and Employments. It
is certain, there may be found an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec421.txt')">infinite</a> Variety of very agreeable
Allusions in both these kinds, but for the generality, the most
entertaining ones lie in the Works of Nature, which are obvious to all
Capacities, and more delightful than what is to be found in Arts and
Sciences.</p><p>It is this Talent of affecting the Imagination, that gives an
Embellishment to good Sense, and makes one Man's Compositions more
agreeable than another's. It sets off all Writings in general, but is
the very Life and highest Perfection of Poetry: Where it shines in an
Eminent Degree, it has preserved several Poems for many Ages, that have
nothing else to recommend them; and where all the other Beauties are
present, the Work appears dry and insipid, if this single one be
wanting. It has something in it like Creation; It bestows a kind of
Existence, and draws up to the Reader's View several Objects which are
not to be found in Being. It makes Additions to Nature, and gives a
greater Variety to God's Works. In a Word, it is able to beautifie and
adorn the most illustrious Scenes in the Universe, or to fill the Mind
with more glorious Shows and Apparitions, than can be found in any Part
of it.</p><p>We have now discovered the several Originals of those Pleasures that
gratify the Fancy; and here, perhaps, it would not be very difficult to
cast under their proper Heads those contrary Objects, which are apt to
fill it with Distaste and Terrour; for the Imagination is as liable to
Pain as Pleasure. When the Brain is hurt by any Accident, or the Mind
disordered by Dreams or Sickness, the Fancy is over-run with wild dismal
Ideas, and terrified with a thousand hideous Monsters of its own framing.</p><p>'Eumenidum veluti demens videt Agmina Pentheus,
Et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere Thebas.
Aut Agamemnonius scenis agitatus Orestes,
Armatam facibus matrem et serpentibus atris
Cum videt, ultricesque sedent in limine Dir√¶.'</p><p>Vir.</p><p>There is not a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec421.txt')">Sight</a> in Nature so mortifying as that of a Distracted
Person, when his Imagination is troubled, and his whole <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec421.txt')">Soul</a> disordered
and confused. _Babylon_ in Ruins is not so melancholy a Spectacle. But
to quit so disagreeable a Subject, I shall only consider, by way of
Conclusion, what an infinite Advantage this Faculty gives an Almighty
Being over the Soul of Man, and how great a measure of Happiness or
Misery we are capable of receiving from the Imagination only.</p><p>We have already seen the Influence that one Man has over the Fancy of
another, and with what Ease he conveys into it a Variety of Imagery; how
great a Power then may we suppose lodged in him, who knows all the ways
of affecting the Imagination, who can infuse what Ideas he pleases, and
fill those Ideas with Terrour and Delight to what Degree he thinks fit?
He can excite Images in the Mind, without the help of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec421.txt')">Words</a>, and make
Scenes rise up before us and seem present to the Eye without the
Assistance of Bodies or Exterior Objects. He can transport the
Imagination with such beautiful and glorious Visions, as cannot possibly
enter into our present Conceptions, or haunt it with such ghastly
Spectres and Apparitions, as would make us hope for Annihilation, and
think Existence no better than a Curse. In short, he can so exquisitely
ravish or torture the Soul through this single Faculty, as might suffice
to make up the whole Heaven or Hell of any finite Being.</p><p>This Essay on the Pleasures of the Imagination having been published in
separate Papers, I shall conclude it with a Table of the principal
Contents in each Paper.</p><p>
The CONTENTS.</p><p>
PAPER I. [No. 411, Volume 2.]</p><p>The Perfection of our Sight above our other Senses. The Pleasures of
the Imagination arise originally from Sight. The Pleasures of the
Imagination divided under two Heads. The Pleasures of the Imagination
in some Respects equal to those of the Understanding. The Extent of
the Pleasures of the Imagination. The Advantages a Man receives from a
Relish of these Pleasures. In what Respect they are preferable to
those of the Understanding.</p><p>
PAPER II. [No. 412, Volume 2.]</p><p>Three Sources of all the Pleasures of the Imagination, in our Survey
of outward Objects. How what is Great pleases the Imagination. How
what is New pleases the Imagination. How what is Beautiful in our own
Species, pleases the Imagination. How what is Beautiful in general
pleases the Imagination. What other Accidental Causes may contribute
to the heightening of these Pleasures.</p><p>
PAPER III. [No. 413, Volume 2.]</p><p>Why the Necessary Cause of our being pleased with what is Great, New,
or Beautiful, unknown. Why the Final Cause more known and more useful.
The Final Cause of our being pleased with what is Great. The Final
Cause of our being pleased with what is New. The Final Cause of our
being pleased with what is Beautiful in our own Species. The Final
Cause of our being pleased with what is Beautiful in general.</p><p>
PAPER IV. [No. 414, Volume 2.]</p><p>The Works of Nature more pleasant to the Imagination than those of
Art. The Works of Nature still more pleasant, the more they resemble
those of Art. The Works of Art more pleasant, the more they resemble
those of Nature. Our English Plantations and Gardens considered in the
foregoing Light.</p><p>
PAPER V. [No. 415, Volume 2.]</p><p>Of Architecture as it affects the Imagination. Greatness in
Architecture relates either to the Bulk or to the Manner. Greatness of
Bulk in the Ancient Oriental Buildings. The ancient Accounts of these
Buildings confirm'd,</p><p>1. From the Advantages, for raising such Works, in the first Ages of
the World and in the Eastern Climates:</p><p>2. From several of them which are still extant.</p><p>Instances how Greatness of Manner affects the Imagination. A French
Author's Observation on this Subject. Why Concave and Convex Figures
give a Greatness of Manner to Works of Architecture. Every thing that
pleases the Imagination in Architecture is either Great, Beautiful, or
New.</p><p>
PAPER VI. [No. 416, Volume 2.]</p><p>The Secondary Pleasures of the Imagination. The several Sources of
these Pleasures (Statuary, Painting, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec421.txt')">Description</a> and Musick) compared
together. The Final Cause of our receiving Pleasure from these several
Sources. Of Descriptions in particular. The Power of Words over the
Imagination. Why one Reader more pleased with Descriptions than
another.</p><p>
PAPER VII. [No. 417, Volume 3.]</p><p>How a whole Set of Ideas Hang together, &c. A Natural Cause assigned
for it. How to perfect the Imagination of a Writer. Who among the
Ancient Poets had this Faculty in its greatest Perfection. Homer
excelled in Imagining what is Great; Virgil in Imagining what is
Beautiful; Ovid in imagining what is New. Our own Country-man Milton
very perfect in all three respects.</p><p>
PAPER VIII. [No. 418, Volume 3.]</p><p>Why any thing that is unpleasant to behold, pleases the Imagination
when well described. Why the Imagination receives a more Exquisite
Pleasure from the Description of what is Great, New, or Beautiful. The
Pleasure still heightned, if--what is described raises Passion in the
Mind. Disagreeable Passions pleasing when raised by apt Descriptions.
Why Terror and Grief are pleasing to the Mind when excited by
Descriptions. A particular Advantage the Writers in Poetry and Fiction
have to please the Imagination. What Liberties are allowed them.</p><p>
PAPER IX. [No. 419, Volume 3.]</p><p>Of that kind of Poetry which Mr. Dryden calls the Fairy Way of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec421.txt')">Writing</a>. How a Poet should be Qualified for it. The Pleasures of the
Imagination that arise from it. In this respect why the Moderns excell
the Ancients. Why the English excell the Moderns. Who the Best among
the English. Of Emblematical Persons.</p><p>
PAPER X. [No. 420, Volume 3.]</p><p>What Authors please the Imagination who have nothing to do with
Fiction. How History pleases the Imagination. How the Authors of the
new Philosophy please the Imagination. The Bounds and Defects of the
Imagination. Whether these Defects are Essential to the Imagination.</p><p>
PAPER XI. [No. 421, Volume 3.]</p><p>How those please the Imagination who treat of Subjects abstracted from
Matter, by Allusions taken from it. What Allusions most pleasing to
the Imagination. Great Writers how Faulty in this Respect. Of the Art
of Imagining in General. The Imagination capable of Pain as well as
Pleasure. In what Degree the Imagination is capable either of Pain or
Pleasure.</p><p>
