<p>No. 423.                  Saturday, July 5, 1712.                  Steele.</p><p></p><p>'--Nuper Idoneus.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I look upon my self as a Kind of Guardian to the Fair, and am always
watchful to observe any thing which concerns their Interest. The present
Paper shall be employed in the Service of a very fine young <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec423.txt')">Woman</a>; and
the Admonitions I give her, may not be unuseful to the rest of the Sex.
_Gloriana_ shall be the Name of the Heroine in To-day's Entertainment;
and when I have told you that she is rich, witty, young and beautiful,
you will believe she does not want Admirers. She has had since she came
to Town about twenty five of those Lovers, who make their Addresses by
way of Jointure and Settlement. These come and go, with <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec423.txt')">great</a>
Indifference on both Sides; and as beauteous as she is, a Line in a Deed
has had Exception enough against it, to outweigh the Lustre of her Eyes,
the Readiness of her Understanding, and the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec423.txt')">Merit</a> of her general
Character. But among the Crowd of such cool Adorers, she has two who are
very assiduous in their Attendance. There is something so extraordinary
and artful in their <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec423.txt')">Manner</a> of Application, that I think it but common
Justice to alarm her in it. I have done it in the following Letter.</p><p>
Madam,</p><p>'I have for some time taken Notice of two Gentlemen who attend you in
all publick Places, both of whom have also easie Access to you at your
own House: But the Matter is adjusted between them, and _Damon_, who
so passionately addresses you, has no Design upon you; but _Strephon_,
who seems to be indifferent to you, is the Man, who is, as they have
settled it, to have you. The Plot was laid over a Bottle of Wine; and
_Strephon_, when he first thought of you, proposed to _Damon_ to be
his Rival. The manner of his breaking of it to him, I was so placed at
a Tavern, that I could not avoid hearing. _Damon_, said he with a deep
Sigh, I have long languished for that Miracle of Beauty _Gloriana_,
and if you will be very stedfastly my Rival, I shall certainly obtain
her. Do not, continued he, be offended at this Overture; for I go upon
the Knowledge of the Temper of the Woman, rather than any Vanity that
I should profit by an Opposition of your Pretensions to those of your
humble Servant. _Gloriana_ has very good Sense, a quick Relish of the
Satisfactions of Life, and will not give her self, as the Crowd of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec423.txt')">Women</a> do, to the Arms of a Man to whom she is indifferent. As she is a
sensible Woman, Expressions of Rapture and Adoration will not move her
neither; but he that has her must be the Object of her Desire, not her
Pity. The Way to this End I take to be, that a Man's general Conduct
should be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec423.txt')">agreeable</a>, without addressing in particular to the Woman he
loves. Now, Sir, if you will be so kind as to sigh and die for
_Gloriana_, I will carry it with great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec423.txt')">Respect</a> towards her, but seem
void of any Thoughts as a Lover. By this Means I shall be in the most
amiable Light of which I am capable; I shall be received with Freedom,
you with Reserve. _Damon_, who has himself no Designs of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec423.txt')">Marriage</a> at
all, easily fell into the Scheme; and you may observe, that where-ever
you are _Damon_ appears also. You see he carries on an unaffecting
Exactness in his Dress and Manner, and strives always to be the very
Contrary of _Strephon_. They have already succeeded so far, that your
Eyes are ever in Search of _Strephon_, and turn themselves of Course
from _Damon_. They meet and compare Notes upon your Carriage; and the
Letter which, was brought to you the other Day, was a Contrivance to
remark your Resentment. When you saw the Billet subscribed _Damon_,
and turned away with a scornful Air, and cried Impertinence! you gave
Hopes to him that shuns you, without mortifying him that languishes
for you. What I am concerned for, Madam, is, that in the disposal of
your Heart, you should know what you are doing, and examine it before
it is lost. _Strephon_ contradicts you in Discourse with the Civility
of one who has a Value for you, but gives up nothing like one that
loves you. This seeming Unconcern gives this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec423.txt')">Behaviour</a> the advantage
of Sincerity, and insensibly obtains your good Opinion, by appearing
disinterested in the purchase of it. If you watch these Correspondents
hereafter, you will find that _Strephon_ makes his Visit of Civility
immediately after _Damon_ has tired you with one of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec423.txt')">Love</a>. Tho' you are
very discreet, you will find it no easie matter to escape the Toils so
well laid, as when one studies to be disagreeable in Passion, the
other to be pleasing without it. All the Turns of your Temper are
carefully watched, and their quick and faithful Intelligence gives
your Lovers irresistible Advantage. You will please, Madam, to be upon
your guard, and take all the necessary Precautions against one who is
amiable to you before you know he is enamoured.</p><p>_I am, Madam,
Your most Obedient Servant._</p><p>
_Strephon_ makes great Progress in this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec423.txt')">Lady</a>'s good Graces, for most
Women being actuated by some little Spirit of Pride and Contradiction,
he has the good effects of both those Motives by this Covert-Way of
Courtship. He received a Message Yesterday from _Damon_ in the following
Words, superscribed _With Speed_.</p><p>'All goes well; she is very angry at me, and I dare say hates me in
earnest. It is a good time to Visit.
_Yours_.'</p><p>
The Comparison of _Strephon's_ Gayety to _Damon's_ Languishment, strikes
her Imagination with a Prospect of very agreeable Hours with such a Man
as the former, and Abhorrence of the insipid Prospect with one like the
latter. To know when a Lady is displeased with another, is to know the
best time of advancing your self. This method of two Persons playing
into each other's Hand is so dangerous, that I cannot tell how a Woman
could be able to withstand such a Siege. The Condition of _Gloriana_, I
am afraid, is irretrievable, for _Strephon_ has had so many
Opportunities of pleasing without suspicion, that all which is left for
her to do is to bring him, now she is advised, to an Explanation of his
Passion, and beginning again, if she can conquer the kind Sentiments she
has already conceived for him. When one shews himself a Creature to be
avoided, the other proper to be fled to for Succour, they have the whole
Woman between them, and can occasionally rebound her Love and Hatred
from one to the other, in such a manner as to keep her at a distance
from all the rest of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec423.txt')">World</a>, and cast Lots for the Conquest.</p><p>N. B. _I have many other Secrets which concern the Empire of Love, but I
consider that while I alarm my Women, I instruct my Men_.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
