<p>No. 430.                   Monday, July 14, 1712.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Qu√¶re peregrinum vicinia rauca reclamat.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>As you are Spectator-General, you may with Authority censure
whatsoever looks <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec430.txt')">ill</a>, and is offensive to the <a name="topic21" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec430.txt')">Sight</a>; the worst Nusance
of which kind, methinks, is the scandalous Appearance of <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec430.txt')">Poor</a> in all
Parts of this wealthy City. Such miserable <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec430.txt')">Objects</a> affect the
compassionate Beholder with dismal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec430.txt')">Ideas</a>, discompose the Chearfulness
of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec430.txt')">Mind</a>, and deprive him of the Pleasure that he might otherwise
take in surveying the Grandeur of our Metropolis. Who can without
Remorse see a disabled Sailor, the Purveyor of our Luxury, destitute
of Necessaries? Who can behold an honest Soldier, that bravely
withstood the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec430.txt')">Enemy</a>, prostrate and in Want amongst his Friends? It
were endless to mention all the Variety of Wretchedness, and the
numberless Poor, that not only singly, but in Companies, implore your
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec430.txt')">Charity</a>. Spectacles of this Nature every where occur; and it is
unaccountable, that amongst the many lamentable Cries that infest this
Town, your Comptroller-General should not take notice of the most
shocking, _viz_. those of the Needy and Afflicted. I can't but think
he wav'd it meerly out of good Breeding, chusing rather to stifle his
Resentment, than upbraid his Countrymen with Inhumanity; however, let
not Charity be sacrificed to Popularity, and if his Ears were deaf to
their Complaints, let not your Eyes overlook their Persons. There are,
I know, many Impostors among them. Lameness and Blindness are
certainly very often acted; but can those that have their Sight and
Limbs, employ them better than in knowing whether they are
counterfeited or not? I know not which of the two misapplies his
Senses most, he who pretends himself blind to move Compassion, or he
who beholds a miserable Object without pitying it. But in order to
remove such Impediments, I wish, Mr. SPECTATOR, you would give us a
Discourse upon Beggars, that we may not pass by true Objects of
Charity, or give to Impostors. I looked out of my Window the other
Morning earlier than ordinary, and saw a blind Beggar, an Hour before
the Passage he stands in is frequented, with a Needle and Thread,
thriftily mending his Stockings: My Astonishment was still greater,
when I beheld a lame Fellow, whose Legs were too big to walk within an
Hour after, bring him a Pot of Ale. I will not mention the Shakings,
Distortions, and Convulsions which many of them practise to gain an
Alms; but sure I am, they ought to be taken Care of in this Condition,
either by the Beadle or the Magistrate. They, it seems, relieve their
Posts according to their Talents. There is the Voice of an old Woman
never begins to beg 'till nine in the Evening, and then she is
destitute of Lodging, turned out for want of Rent, and has the same
ill Fortune every Night in the Year. You should employ an Officer to
hear the Distress of each Beggar that is constant at a particular
Place, who is ever in the same Tone, and succeeds because his Audience
is continually changing, tho' he does not alter his Lamentation. If we
have nothing else for our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec430.txt')">Money</a>, let us have more Invention to be
cheated with. All which is submitted to your Spectatorial Vigilance:
and I am,
SIR,
Your most humble Servant.</p><p>
SIR,</p><p>I was last _Sunday_ highly transported at our Parish-Church; the
Gentleman in the Pulpit pleaded movingly in Behalf of the poor
Children, and they for themselves much more forcibly by singing an
Hymn; And I had the Happiness to be a Contributor to this little
religious Institution of Innocents, and am sure I never disposed of
Money more to my Satisfaction and Advantage. The inward Joy I find in
my self, and the Good-will I bear to Mankind, make me heartily wish
those pious Works may be encouraged, that the present Promoters may
reap the Delight, and Posterity the Benefit of them. But whilst we are
building this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec430.txt')">beautiful</a> Edifice, let not the old Ruins remain in View
to sully the Prospect: Whilst we are cultivating and improving this
young hopeful Offspring, let not the ancient and helpless Creatures be
shamefully neglected. The Crowds of Poor, or pretended Poor, in every
Place, are a great Reproach to us, and eclipse the Glory of all other
Charity. It is the utmost Reproach to Society, that there should be a
poor Man unrelieved, or a poor Rogue unpunished. I hope you will think
no Part of Human Life out of your Consideration, but will, at your
Leisure, give us the History of Plenty and Want, and the natural
Gradations towards them, calculated for the Cities of _London_ and
_Westminster_.
_I am, SIR,
Your most Humble Servant_,
T. D.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I beg you would be pleased to take Notice of a very great Indecency,
which is extreamly common, though, I think, never yet under your
Censure. It is, Sir, the strange Freedoms some ill-bred married <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec430.txt')">People</a>
take in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec430.txt')">Company</a>: The unseasonable Fondness of some Husbands, and the
ill-timed Tenderness of some Wives. They talk and act, as if Modesty
was only fit for Maids and Batchelors, and that too before both. I was
once, Mr. SPECTATOR, where the Fault I <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec430.txt')">speak</a> of was so very flagrant,
that (being, you must know, a very bashful Fellow, and several young
Ladies in the Room) I protest I was quite out of Countenance.
_Lucina_, it seems, was breeding, and she did nothing but entertain
the Company with a Discourse upon the Difficulty of Reckoning to a
Day, and said she knew those who were certain to an Hour; then fell a
laughing at a silly unexperienced Creature, who was a Month above her
Time. Upon her Husband's coming in, she put several Questions to him;
which he not caring to resolve, Well, cries _Lucina_, I shall have 'em
all at Night--But lest I should seem <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec430.txt')">guilty</a> of the very Fault I write
against, I shall only intreat _Mr_. SPECTATOR to correct such
Misdemeanors;</p><p>'For higher of the Genial Bed by far,
And with mysterious Reverence, I deem.' [1]</p><p>_I am, SIR,</p><p>Your humble Servant_,</p><p>T. Meanwell.</p><p>
