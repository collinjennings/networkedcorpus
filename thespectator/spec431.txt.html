<p>No. 431.               Tuesday, July 15, 1712.                 Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Quid Dulcius hominum generi a Natura datum est quam sui cuique
liberi?'</p><p>Tull.</p><p></p><p>I have lately been casting in my Thoughts the several Unhappinesses of
Life, and comparing the Infelicities of old Age to those of Infancy. The
Calamities of <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec431.txt')">Children</a> are due to the Negligence and Misconduct of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec431.txt')">Parents</a>, those of Age to the past Life which led to it. I have here the
History of a Boy and Girl to their Wedding-Day, and I think I cannot
give the Reader a livelier Image of the insipid way which Time
uncultivated passes, than by entertaining him with their authentick
Epistles, expressing all that was remarkable in their Lives, 'till the
Period of their Life above mentioned. The Sentence at the Head of this
Paper, which is only a warm Interrogation, _What is there in Nature so
<a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec431.txt')">dear</a> as a Man's own Children to him_? is all the Reflection I shall at
present make on those who are negligent or cruel in the Education of
them.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am now entring into my One and Twentieth Year, and do not know that
I had one Day's thorough Satisfaction since I came to Years of any
Reflection, till the Time they say others lose their Liberty, the Day
of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec431.txt')">Marriage</a>. I am <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec431.txt')">Son</a> to a Gentleman of a very great Estate, who
resolv'd to keep me out of the Vices of the Age; and in order to it
never let me see any Thing that he thought could give me the least
Pleasure. At ten Years old I was put to a Grammar-School, where my
Master received Orders every Post to use me very severely, and have no
regard to my having a great Estate. At Fifteen I was removed to the
University, where I liv'd, out of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec431.txt')">Father</a>'s great Discretion, in
scandalous Poverty and Want, till I was big enough to be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec431.txt')">married</a>, and
I was sent for to see the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec431.txt')">Lady</a> who sends you the Underwritten. When we
were put together, we both considered that we could not be worse than
we were in taking one another, out of a Desire of Liberty entered into
Wedlock. My Father says I am now a Man, and may <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec431.txt')">speak</a> to him like
another Gentleman.</p><p>_I am, SIR,</p><p>Your most humble Servant_,</p><p>Richard Rentfree.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPEC.</p><p>I grew tall and wild at my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec431.txt')">Mother</a>'s, who is a gay Widow, and did not
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec431.txt')">care</a> for shewing me 'till about two Years and a half ago; at which
time my Guardian Uncle sent me to a Boarding-School, with Orders to
contradict me in nothing, for I had been misused enough already. I had
not been there above a Month, when being in the Kitchin, I saw some
Oatmeal on the Dresser; I put two or three Corns in my Mouth, liked
it, stole a Handful, went into my Chamber, chewed it, and for two
Months after never failed taking Toll of every Pennyworth of Oatmeal
that came into the House: But one Day playing with a Tobacco-pipe
between my Teeth, it happened to break in my Mouth, and the spitting
out the Pieces left such a delicious Roughness on my Tongue, that I
could not be satisfied 'till I had champed up the remaining Part of
the Pipe. I forsook the Oatmeal, and stuck to the Pipes three Months,
in which Time I had dispensed with thirty seven foul Pipes, all to the
Boles; They belonged to an old Gentleman, Father to my Governess--He
lock'd up the clean ones. I left off eating of Pipes, and fell to
licking of Chalk. I was soon tired of this; I then nibbled all the red
Wax of our last Ball-Tickets, and three Weeks after the black Wax from
the Burying-Tickets of the old Gentleman. Two Months after this I
liv'd upon Thunder-bolts, a certain long, round bluish Stone, which I
found among the Gravel in our Garden. I was wonderfully delighted with
this; but Thunder-bolts growing scarce, I fasten'd Tooth and Nail upon
our Garden-Wall, which I stuck to almost a Twelvemonth, and had in
that time peeled and devoured half a Foot towards our Neighbour's
Yard. I now thought my self the happiest Creature in the World, and I
believe in my Conscience, I had eaten quite through, had I had it in
my Chamber; but now I became lazy, and unwilling to stir, and was
obliged to seek Food nearer Home. I then took a strange Hankering to
Coals; I fell to scranching 'em, and had already consumed, I am
certain, as much as would have dressed my Wedding Dinner, when my
Uncle came for me Home. He was in the Parlour with my Governess when I
was called down. I went in, fell on my Knees, for he made me <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec431.txt')">call</a> him
Father; and when I expected the Blessing I asked, the good Gentleman,
in a Surprize, turns himself to my Governess, and asks, Whether this
(pointing to me) was his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec431.txt')">Daughter</a>? This (added he) is the very Picture
of Death. My <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec431.txt')">Child</a> was a plump-fac'd, hale, fresh-coloured Girl; but
this looks as if she was half-starved, a mere Skeleton. My Governess,
who is really a good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec431.txt')">Woman</a>, assured my Father I had wanted for
nothing; and withal told him I was continually eating some Trash or
other, and that I was almost eaten up with the Green-sickness, her
Orders being never to cross me. But this magnified but little with my
Father, who presently, in a kind of Pett, paying for my Board, took me
home with him. I had not been long at home, but one _Sunday_ at Church
(I shall never forget it) I saw a young neighbouring Gentleman that
pleased me hugely; I liked him of all Men I ever saw in my Life, and
began to wish I could be as pleasing to him. The very next Day he
came, with his Father, a visiting to our House: We were left alone
together, with Directions on both Sides to be in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec431.txt')">Love</a> with one
another, and in three Weeks time we were married. I regained my former
Health and Complexion, and am now as happy as the Day is long. Now,
_Mr_. SPEC., I desire you would find out some Name for these craving
Damsels, whether dignified or distinguished under some or all of the
following Denominations, (to wit) _Trash-eaters, Oatmeal-chewers,
Pipe-champers, Chalk-lickers, Wax-nibbles, Coal-Scranchers,
Wall-peelers_, or _Gravel-diggers_: And, good Sir, do your utmost
endeavour to prevent (by exposing) this unaccountable Folly, so
prevailing among the young ones of our Sex, who may not meet with such
sudden good Luck as,</p><p>_SIR,
Your constant Reader,
and very humble Servant_,
Sabina Green,
_Now_ Sabina Rentfree.</p><p>
