<p>No. 432.                Wednesday, July 16, 1712.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Inter-strepit anser olores.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>Oxford, July 14.</p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>According to a late Invitation in one of your Papers to every <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec432.txt')">Man</a> who
pleases to write, I have sent you the following short Dissertation
against the <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec432.txt')">Vice</a> of being prejudiced.</p><p>_Your most humble Servant_.</p><p>
Man is a sociable Creature, and a Lover of <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec432.txt')">Glory</a>; whence it is that
when several Persons are united in the same Society, they are studious
to lessen the Reputation of others, in order to raise their own. The
Wise are content to guide the Springs in Silence, and rejoice in
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec432.txt')">Secret</a> at their regular Progress: To prate and triumph is the Part
allotted to the Trifling and Superficial: The Geese were
providentially ordained to save the _Capitol_. Hence it is, that the
Invention of Marks and Devices to distinguish Parties, is owing to the
_Beaux_ and _Belles_ of this Island. Hats moulded into different Cocks
and Pinches, have long bid mutual Defiance; Patches have been set
against Patches in Battel-aray; Stocks have risen or fallen in
Proportion to Head-Dresses; and Peace or War been expected, as the
_White_ or the _Red_ Hood hath prevailed. These are the
Standard-Bearers in our contending Armies, the Dwarfs and Squires who
carry the Impresses of the Giants or Knights, not born to fight
themselves, but to prepare the Way for the ensuing Combat.</p><p>It is Matter of Wonder to reflect how far Men of weak Understanding
and strong Fancy are hurried by their Prejudices, even to the
believing that the whole <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec432.txt')">Body</a> of the adverse <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec432.txt')">Party</a> are a Band of
Villains and DÃ¦mons. Foreigners complain, that the _English_ are the
proudest Nation under Heaven. Perhaps they too have their Share; but
be that as it will, general Charges against Bodies of Men is the Fault
I am writing against. It must be own'd, to our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec432.txt')">Shame</a>, that our common
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec432.txt')">People</a>, and most who have not travelled, have an irrational Contempt
for the Language, Dress, Customs, and even the Shape and Minds of
other Nations. Some Men otherwise of Sense, have wondered that a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec432.txt')">great</a>
Genius should spring out of _Ireland_; and think you mad in affirming,
that fine Odes have been written in _Lapland_.</p><p>This Spirit of Rivalship, which heretofore reigned in the Two
Universities, is extinct, and almost over betwixt College and College:
In Parishes and Schools the Thirst of Glory still obtains. At the
Seasons of Football and Cock-fighting, these little Republicks
reassume their national Hatred to each other. My Tenant in the Country
is verily perswaded, that the Parish of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec432.txt')">Enemy</a> hath not one honest
Man in it.</p><p>I always hated Satyrs against <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec432.txt')">Woman</a>, and Satyrs against Man; I am apt
to suspect a Stranger who laughs at the Religion of _The Faculty_; My
Spleen rises at a dull Rogue, who is severe upon Mayors and Aldermen;
and was never better pleased than with a Piece of Justice executed
upon the Body of a Templer, who was very arch upon Parsons.</p><p>The Necessities of Mankind require various Employments; and whoever
excels in his Province is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec432.txt')">worthy</a> of Praise. All Men are not educated
after the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec432.txt')">Manner</a>, nor have all the same Talents. Those who are
deficient deserve our Compassion, and have a Title to our Assistance.
All cannot be bred in the same Place; but in all Places there arise,
at different Times, such Persons as do <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec432.txt')">Honour</a> to their Society, which
may raise Envy in little Souls, but are admired and cherished by
generous Spirits.</p><p>It is certainly a great Happiness to be educated in Societies of great
and eminent Men. Their Instructions and Examples are of extraordinary
Advantage. It is highly proper to instill such a Reverence of the
governing Persons, and Concern for the Honour of the Place, as may
spur the growing Members to worthy Pursuits and honest Emulation: But
to swell <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec432.txt')">young</a> Minds with vain Thoughts of the Dignity of their own
Brotherhood, by debasing and villifying all others, doth them a real
Injury. By this means I have found that their Efforts have become
languid, and their Prattle irksome, as thinking it sufficient Praise
that they are Children of so illustrious and ample a Family. I should
think it a surer as well as more generous Method, to set before the
Eyes of Youth such Persons as have made a noble Progress in
Fraternities less talk'd of; which seems tacitly to reproach their
Sloth, who loll so heavily in the Seats of mighty Improvement: Active
Spirits hereby would enlarge their Notions, whereas by a servile
Imitation of one, or perhaps two, admired Men in their own Body, they
can only gain a secondary and derivative kind of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec432.txt')">Fame</a>. These Copiers
of Men, like those of Authors or Painters, run into Affectations of
some Oddness, which perhaps was not disagreeable in the Original, but
sits ungracefully on the narrow-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec432.txt')">soul</a>'d Transcriber.</p><p>By such early Corrections of Vanity, while Boys are growing into Men,
they will gradually learn not to censure superficially; but imbibe
those Principles of general Kindness and Humanity, which alone can
make them easie to themselves, and beloved by others.</p><p>Reflections of this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec432.txt')">nature</a> have expunged all Prejudices out of my
Heart, insomuch that, tho' I am a firm Protestant, I hope to see the
Pope and Cardinals without violent Emotions; and tho' I am naturally
grave, I expect to meet good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec432.txt')">Company</a> at _Paris_.</p><p>_I am, SIR,
Your obedient Servant_.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I find you are a general Undertaker, and have by your Correspondents
or self an Insight into most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec432.txt')">things</a>: which makes me apply my self to
you at present in the sorest Calamity that ever befel Man. My Wife has
taken something <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec432.txt')">ill</a> of me, and has not spoke one <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec432.txt')">Word</a>, good or bad, to
me, or any Body in the Family, since _Friday_ was Seven-night. What
must a Man do in that Case? Your Advice would be a great Obligation
to,</p><p>_SIR, Your most humble Servant_,</p><p>Ralph Thimbleton.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>When you want a Trifle to fill up a Paper, in inserting this you will
lay an Obligation on</p><p>_Your humble Servant_,</p><p>Olivio.
July 15th, 1712.</p><p>
_Dear_ Olivia,</p><p>It is but this Moment I have had the Happiness of knowing to whom I
am obliged for the Present I received the second of _April_. I am
heartily sorry it did not come to Hand the Day before; for I can't
but think it very hard upon People to lose their Jest, that offer at
one but once a Year. I congratulate my self however upon the Earnest
given me of something further intended in my Favour, for I am told,
that the Man who is thought worthy by a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec432.txt')">Lady</a> to make a Fool of,
stands <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec432.txt')">fair</a> enough in her Opinion to become one Day her Husband.
Till such time as I have the Honour of being sworn, I take Leave to
subscribe my self,</p><p>_Dear_ Olivia, _Your Fool Elect_,</p><p>Nicodemuncio.</p><p>
T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
