<p>No. 434.                Friday, July 18, 1712.                Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Quales Threiciæ cùm flumina Thermodoontis
Pulsant, et pictis bellantur Amazones armis:
Seu circum Hippolyten, seu cùm se Martia curru
Penthesilea refert, magnoque ululante tumultu
Fæminea exultant lunatis agmina peltis.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p>
Having carefully perused the Manuscript I mentioned in my Yesterday's
Paper, so far as it relates to the Republick of <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec434.txt')">Women</a>, I find in it
several Particulars which may very well deserve the Reader's Attention.</p><p>The Girls of Quality, from six to twelve Years old, were put to publick
Schools, where they learned to Box and play at Cudgels, with several
other Accomplishments of the same Nature; so that nothing was more usual
than to see a little Miss returning Home at Night with a broken Pate, or
two or three Teeth knocked out of her <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec434.txt')">Head</a>. They were afterwards taught
to ride the great Horse, to Shoot, Dart, or Sling, and listed into
several Companies, in order to perfect themselves in Military Exercises.
No <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec434.txt')">Woman</a> was to be married till she had killed her Man. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec434.txt')">Ladies</a> of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec434.txt')">Fashion</a> used to play with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec434.txt')">young</a> Lions instead of Lap-dogs, and when they
made any Parties of Diversion, instead of entertaining themselves at
Ombre or Piquet, they would wrestle and pitch the Bar for a whole
Afternoon together. There was never any such thing as a Blush seen, or a
Sigh heard, in the Commonwealth. The Women never <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec434.txt')">dressed</a> but to look
terrible, to which end they would sometimes after a Battel paint their
Cheeks with the Blood of their Enemies. For this Reason likewise the
Face which had the most Scars was looked upon as the most beautiful. If
they found Lace, Jewels, Ribbons, or any Ornaments in Silver or Gold
among the Booty which they had taken, they used to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec434.txt')">dress</a> their Horses
with it, but never entertained a Thought of wearing it themselves. There
were particular Rights and Privileges allowed to any Member of the
Commonwealth, who was a Mother of three Daughters. The Senate was made
up of old Women; for by the Laws of the Country none was to be a
Councellor of State that was not past Child-bearing. They used to boast
their Republick had continued Four thousand Years, which is altogether
improbable, unless we may suppose, what I am very apt to think, that
they measured their Time by _Lunar_ Years.</p><p>There was a great Revolution brought about in this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec434.txt')">Female</a> Republick, by
means of a neighbouring <a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec434.txt')">King</a>, who had made <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec434.txt')">War</a> upon them several Years
with various Success, and at length overthrew them in a very great
Battel. This Defeat they ascribe to several Causes; some say that the
Secretary of State having been troubled with the Vapours, had committed
some fatal Mistakes in several Dispatches about that Time. Others
pretend, that the first Minister being big with Child, could not attend
the Publick Affairs, as so great an Exigency of State required; but this
I can give no <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec434.txt')">manner</a> of Credit to, since it seems to contradict a
Fundamental Maxim in their Government which I have before mentioned. My
Author gives the most probable Reason of this great Disaster; for he
affirms, that the General was brought to Bed, or (as others say)
Miscarried the very Night before the Battel: However it was, this signal
Overthrow obliged them to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec434.txt')">call</a> in the Male Republick to their
Assistance; but notwithstanding their Common Efforts to repulse the
Victorious Enemy, the War continued for many Years before they could
entirely bring it to a happy Conclusion.</p><p>The Campaigns which both Sexes passed together made them so well
acquainted with one another, that at the End of the War they did not
care for parting. In the Beginning of it they lodged in separate Camps,
but afterwards as they grew more familiar, they pitched their Tents
promiscuously.</p><p>From this time the Armies being Chequered with both Sexes, they polished
apace. The Men used to invite their Fellow-Soldiers into their Quarters,
and would dress their Tents with Flowers and Boughs, for their
Reception. If they chanced to like one more than another, they would be
cutting her Name in the Table, or Chalking out her Figure upon a Wall,
or talking of her in a kind of rapturous Language, which by degrees
improved into Verse and Sonnet. These were as the first Rudiments of
Architecture, Painting, and Poetry among this Savage <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec434.txt')">People</a>. After any
Advantage over the Enemy, both Sexes used to Jump together and make a
Clattering with their Swords and Shields, for Joy, which in a few Years
produced several Regular Tunes and Sett Dances.</p><p>As the two Armies romped on these Occasions, the Women complained of the
thick bushy Beards and long Nails of their Confederates, who thereupon
took care to prune themselves into such Figures as were most pleasing to
their Female Friends and Allies.</p><p>When they had taken any Spoils from the Enemy, the Men would make a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec434.txt')">Present</a> of every thing that was Rich and Showy to the Women whom they
most admired, and would frequently dress the Necks, or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec434.txt')">Heads</a>, or Arms of
their Mistresses, with any thing which they thought appeared Gay or
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec434.txt')">Pretty</a>. The Women observing that the Men took delight in looking upon
them, when they were adorned with such Trappings and Gugaws, set their
Heads at Work to find out new Inventions, and to outshine one another in
all Councils of War or the like solemn Meetings. On the other hand, the
Men observing how the Women's Hearts were set upon Finery, begun to
Embellish themselves and look as agreeably as they could in the Eyes of
their Associates. In short, after a few Years conversing together, the
Women had learnt to Smile, and the Men to Ogle, the Women grew Soft, and
the Men Lively.</p><p>When they had thus insensibly formed one another, upon the finishing of
the War, which concluded with an entire Conquest of their common Enemy,
the Colonels in one <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec434.txt')">Army</a> Married the Colonels in the other; the Captains
in the same Manner took the Captains to their Wives: The whole Body of
common Soldiers were matched, after the Example of their Leaders. By
this means the two Republicks incorporated with one another, and became
the most Flourishing and Polite Government in the Part of the World
which they Inhabited.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
