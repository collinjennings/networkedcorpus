<p>No. 435.               Saturday, July 19, 1712.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Nec duo sunt at forma duplex, nec f√¶mina dici
Nec puer ut possint, neutrumque et utrumque videntur.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>Most of the Papers I give the Publick are written on Subjects that never
vary, but are for ever fixt and immutable. Of this kind are all my more
serious Essays and Discourses; but there is another sort of
Speculations, which I consider as Occasional Papers, that take their
Rise from the Folly, Extravagance, and Caprice of the <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec435.txt')">present</a> Age. For I
look upon my self as one set to watch the Manners and <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec435.txt')">Behaviour</a> of my
Countrymen and Contemporaries, and to mark down every absurd <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec435.txt')">Fashion</a>,
ridiculous Custom, or affected Form of Speech that makes its Appearance
in the World, during the Course of these my Speculations. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec435.txt')">Petticoat</a>
no sooner begun to swell, but I observed its Motions. The Party-patches
had not time to muster themselves before I detected them. I had
Intelligence of the Coloured Hood the very first time it appeared in a
Publick Assembly. I might here mention several other the like Contingent
Subjects, upon which I have bestowed distinct Papers. By this Means I
have so effectually quashed those Irregularities which gave Occasion to
'em, that I am afraid Posterity will scarce have a sufficient Idea of
them, to relish those Discourses which were in no little Vogue at the
time when they were written. They will be apt to think that the Fashions
and Customs I attacked were some Fantastick Conceits of my own, and that
their Great-Grand-mothers could not be so whimsical as I have
represented them. For this Reason, when I think on the Figure my several
Volumes of Speculations will make about a Hundred Years hence, I
consider them as so many Pieces of old Plate, where the Weight will be
regarded, but the Fashion lost.</p><p>Among the several <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec435.txt')">Female</a> Extravagancies I have already taken Notice of,
there is one which still keeps its Ground. I mean that of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec435.txt')">Ladies</a> who
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec435.txt')">dress</a> themselves in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec435.txt')">Hat</a> and Feather, a Riding-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec435.txt')">coat</a> and a Perriwig, or
at least tie up their Hair in a Bag or Ribbond, in imitation of the
smart Part of the opposite <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec435.txt')">Sex</a>. As in my Yesterday's Paper I gave an
Account of the Mixture of two Sexes in one Commonwealth, I shall here
take notice of this Mixture of two Sexes in one Person. I have already
shewn my Dislike of this Immodest Custom more than once; but in Contempt
of every thing I have hitherto said, I am informed that the Highways
about this great City are still very much infested with these Female
Cavaliers.</p><p>I remember when I was at my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec435.txt')">Friend</a> Sir ROGER DE COVERLY'S about this
time Twelve-month, an Equestrian <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec435.txt')">Lady</a> of this Order appeared upon the
Plains which lay at a distance from his House. I was at that time
walking in the Fields with my old Friend; and as his Tenants ran out on
every side to see so strange a Sight, Sir ROGER asked one of them who
came by us what it was? To which the Country Fellow reply'd, 'Tis a
Gentlewoman, saving your Worship's Presence, in a Coat and Hat. This
produced a great deal of Mirth at the Knight's House, where we had a
Story at the same time of another of his Tenants, who meeting this
Gentleman-like Lady on the High-way, was asked by her _whether that was_
Coverly-Hall, the Honest Man seeing only the Male Part of the Querist,
replied, _Yes, Sir_; but upon the second Question, _whether_ Sir ROGER
DE COVERLY _was a married Man_, having dropped his Eye upon the
Petticoat, he changed his Note into _No, Madam_.</p><p>Had one of these Hermaphrodites appeared in _Juvenal's_ Days, with what
an Indignation should we have seen her described by that excellent
Satyrist. He would have represented her in a Riding Habit, as a greater
Monster than the Centaur. He would have called for Sacrifices or
Purifying Waters, to expiate the Appearance of such a Prodigy. He would
have invoked the Shades of _Portia_ or _Lucretia_, to see into what the
_Roman_ Ladies had transformed themselves.</p><p>For my own part, I am for treating the Sex with greater Tenderness, and
have all along made use of the most gentle Methods to bring them off
from any little Extravagance into which they are sometimes unwarily
fallen: I think it however absolutely necessary to keep up the Partition
between the two Sexes, and to take Notice of the smallest Encroachments
which the one makes upon the other. I hope therefore that I shall not
hear any more Complaints on this Subject. I am sure my She-Disciples who
peruse these my daily Lectures, have profited but little by them, if
they are capable of giving into such an Amphibious Dress. This I should
not have mentioned, had not I lately met one of these my Female Readers
in _Hyde Park_, who looked upon me with a masculine Assurance, and
cocked her Hat full in my Face.</p><p>For my part, I have one general Key to the Behaviour of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec435.txt')">Fair</a> Sex.
When I see them singular in any Part of their Dress, I conclude it is
not without some Evil Intention; and therefore question not but the
Design of this strange Fashion is to smite more effectually their Male
Beholders. Now to set them right in this Particular, I would fain have
them consider with themselves whether we are not more likely to be
struck by a Figure entirely Female, than with such an one as we may see
every Day in our Glasses: Or, if they please, let them reflect upon
their own Hearts, and think how they would be affected should they meet
a Man on Horseback, in his Breeches and Jack-Boots, and at the same time
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec435.txt')">dressed</a> up in a Commode and a Night-raile.</p><p>I must observe that this Fashion was first of all brought to us from
_France_, a Country which has Infected all the Nations of _Europe_ with
its Levity. I <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec435.txt')">speak</a> not this in derogation of a whole <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec435.txt')">People</a>, having
more than once found fault with those general Reflections which strike
at Kingdoms or Commonwealths in the Gross: A piece of Cruelty, which an
ingenious Writer of our own compares to that of _Caligula_, who wished
the _Roman_ People had all but one Neck, that he might behead them at a
Blow. I shall therefore only Remark, that as Liveliness and Assurance
are in a peculiar <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec435.txt')">manner</a> the Qualifications of the _French_ Nation, the
same Habits and Customs will not give the same Offence to that People,
which they produce among those of our own Country. Modesty is our
distinguishing Character, as Vivacity is theirs: And when this our
National Virtue appears in that Female <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec435.txt')">Beauty</a>, for which our _British_
Ladies are celebrated above all others in the Universe, it makes up the
most amiable Object that the Eye of Man can possibly behold.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
