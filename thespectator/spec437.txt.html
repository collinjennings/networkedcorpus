<p>No. 437.                 Tuesday, July 22, 1712.</p><p></p><p>'Tune impune h√¶c facias? Tune hic homines adolescentulos
Imperitos rerum, eductos libere, in fraudem illicis?
Sollicitando, et pollicitando eorum animos lactas?
Ac meritricios amores nuptiis conglutinas?'</p><p>Ter. And.</p><p>
The other Day passed by me in her Chariot a <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec437.txt')">Lady</a> with that pale and wan
Complexion, which we sometimes see in young <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec437.txt')">People</a>, who are fallen into
Sorrow and private Anxiety of Mind, which antedate Age and Sickness. It
is not three Years ago since she was gay, airy, and a little towards
Libertine in her Carriage; but, methought, I easily forgave her that
little Insolence, which she so severely pays for in her present
Condition. _Favilla_, of whom I am speaking, is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec437.txt')">married</a> to a sullen Fool
with <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec437.txt')">Wealth</a>: Her Beauty and Merit are lost upon the Dolt, who is
insensible of Perfection in any thing. Their Hours together are either
painful or insipid: The Minutes she has to herself in his Absence, are
not sufficient to give Vent at her Eyes to the Grief and Torment of his
last <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec437.txt')">Conversation</a>. This <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec437.txt')">poor</a> Creature was sacrificed with a Temper
(which, under the Cultivation of a Man of Sense, would have made the
most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec437.txt')">agreeable</a> Companion) into the Arms of this loathsome Yoak-fellow by
_Sempronia_. _Sempronia_ is a good Lady, who supports herself in an
affluent Condition, by contracting Friendship with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec437.txt')">rich</a> young Widows and
Maids of plentiful Fortunes at their own Disposal, and bestowing her
Friends upon worthless indigent Fellows; on the other Side, she ensnares
inconsiderate and rash Youths of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec437.txt')">great</a> Estates into the Arms of vitious
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec437.txt')">Women</a>. For this Purpose, she is accomplished in all the Arts which can
make her acceptable at impertinent Visits; she knows all that passes in
every Quarter, and is well acquainted with all the favourite Servants,
Busiebodies, Dependants, and poor Relations of all Persons of Condition
in the whole Town. At the Price of a good Sum of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec437.txt')">Money</a>, _Sempronia_, by
the Instigation of _Favilla's_ <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec437.txt')">Mother</a>, brought about the Match for the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec437.txt')">Daughter</a>, and the Reputation of this, which is apparently, in point of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec437.txt')">Fortune</a>, more than _Favilla_ could expect, has gained her the Visits and
frequent Attendance of the Crowd of Mothers, who had rather see their
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec437.txt')">Children</a> miserable in great Wealth, than the happiest of the Race of
Mankind in a less conspicuous State of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec437.txt')">Life</a>. When _Sempronia_ is so well
acquainted with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec437.txt')">Woman</a>'s Temper and Circumstance, that she believes
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec437.txt')">Marriage</a> would be acceptable to her, and advantageous to the Man who
shall get her; her next Step is to look out for some one, whose
Condition has some secret Wound in it, and wants a Sum, yet, in the Eye
of the World, not unsuitable to her. If such is not easily had, she
immediately adorns a worthless Fellow with what <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec437.txt')">Estate</a> she thinks
convenient, and adds as great a Share of good Humour and Sobriety as is
requisite: After this is settled, no Importunities, Arts, and Devices
are omitted to hasten the Lady to her Happiness. In the general indeed
she is a Person of so strict Justice, that she marries a poor Gallant to
a rich Wench, and a Moneyless Girl to a Man of Fortune. But then she has
no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec437.txt')">manner</a> of Conscience in the Disparity, when she has a Mind to impose
a poor Rogue for one of an Estate, she has no Remorse in adding to it,
that he is illiterate, ignorant, and unfashioned; but makes those
Imperfections Arguments of the Truth of his Wealth, and will, on such an
Occasion, with a very grave Face, charge the People of Condition with
Negligence in the Education of their Children. Exception being made
t'other Day against an ignorant Booby of her own Cloathing, whom she was
putting off for a rich Heir, _Madam_, said she, _you know there is no
making Children who know they have Estates attend their Books._</p><p>_Sempronia,_ by these Arts, is loaded with Presents, importuned for her
Acquaintance, and admired by those who do not know the first Taste of
Life, as a Woman of exemplary good Breeding. But sure, to murder and to
rob are less Iniquities, than to raise Profit by Abuses, as irreparable
as taking away Life; but more grievous, as making it lastingly unhappy.
To rob a Lady at Play of Half her Fortune, is not so ill, as giving the
whole and her self to an unworthy <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec437.txt')">Husband</a>. But _Sempronia_ can
administer Consolation to an unhappy Fair at Home, by leading her to an
agreeable Gallant elsewhere. She can then preach the general Condition
of all the Married World, and tell an unexperienced young Woman the
Methods of softning her Affliction, and laugh at her Simplicity and Want
of Knowledge, with an _Oh! my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec437.txt')">Dear</a>, you will know better._</p><p>The Wickedness of _Sempronia,_ one would think, should be superlative;
but I cannot but esteem that of some <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec437.txt')">Parents</a> equal to it; I mean such as
sacrifice the greatest Endowments and Qualifications to base Bargains. A
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec437.txt')">Parent</a> who forces a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec437.txt')">Child</a> of a liberal and ingenious Spirit into the
Arms of a Clown or a Blockhead, obliges her to a Crime too odious for a
Name. It is in a Degree the unnatural Conjunction of rational and brutal
Beings. Yet what is there so common, as the bestowing an accomplished
Woman with such a Disparity. And I could name Crowds who lead miserable
Lives, or want of Knowledge in their Parents, of this Maxim, that good
Sense and good Nature always go together. That which is attributed to
Fools, and called good Nature, is only an Inability of observing what is
faulty, which turns in Marriage, into a Suspicion of every thing as
such, from a Consciousness of that Inability.</p><p>
Mr. Spectator,</p><p>'I am entirely of your Opinion with Relation to the Equestrian
Females, who affect both the Masculine and Feminine Air at the same
time; and cannot forbear making a Presentment against another Order of
them who grow very numerous and powerful; and since our Language is
not very capable of good compound Words, I must be contented to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec437.txt')">call</a>
them only the _Naked Shouldered_. These Beauties are not contented to
make Lovers where-ever they appear, but they must make Rivals at the
same time. Were you to see _Gatty_ walk the _Park_ at high Mall, you
would expect those who followed her and those who met her could
immediately draw their Swords for her. I hope, Sir, you will provide
for the future, that Women may stick to their Faces for doing any
future Mischief and not allow any but direct Traders in Beauty to
expose more than the fore Part of the Neck, unless you please to allow
this After-Game to those who are very defective in the Charms of the
Countenance. I can say, to my Sorrow, the present Practice is very
unfair, when to look back is Death; and it may be said of our
Beauties, as a great Poet did of Bullets,</p><p>'They kill and wound like Parthians as they fly.'</p><p>I submit this to your Animadversion; and am, for the little while I
have left,</p><p>_Your humble Servant, the languishing_ Philanthus.</p><p>P. S. Suppose you mended my Letter, and made a Simile about the
Porcupine, but I submit that also.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
