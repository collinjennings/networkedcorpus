<p>No. 440.                 Friday, July 25, 1712.               Addison</p><p></p><p>'Vivere si rect√® nescis, discede peritis.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I have already given my Reader an Account of a Sett of <a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec440.txt')">merry</a> Fellows,
who are passing their Summer together in the Country, being provided of
a great House, where there is not only a convenient Apartment for every
particular Person, but a large Infirmary for the Reception of such of
them as are any way indisposed, or out of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec440.txt')">Humour</a>. Having lately received
a Letter from the Secretary of this <a name="topic46" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec440.txt')">Society</a>, by Order of the whole
Fraternity, which acquaints me with their <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec440.txt')">Behaviour</a> during the last
Week, I shall here make a Present of it to the Publick.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'We are glad to find that you approve the Establishment which we have
here made for the retrieving of good Manners and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec440.txt')">agreeable</a>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec440.txt')">Conversation</a>, and shall use our best Endeavours so to improve our
selves in this our Summer Retirement, that we may next Winter serve as
Patterns to the Town.  But to the end that this our Institution may be
no less Advantageous to the Publick than to our selves, we shall
communicate to you one Week of our Proceedings, desiring you at the
same time, if you see any thing faulty in them, to favour us with your
Admonitions. For you must know, Sir, that it has been proposed among
us to chuse you for our Visitor, to which I must further add, that one
of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec440.txt')">College</a> having declared last Week, he did not like the
_Spectator_ of the Day, and not being able to assign any just Reasons
for such his Dislike, he was sent to the Infirmary _Nemine
Contradicente_.</p><p>'On _Monday_ the Assembly was in very good Humour, having received
some Recruits of _French_ Claret that Morning: when unluckily, towards
the middle of the Dinner, one of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec440.txt')">Company</a> swore at his Servant in a
very rough <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec440.txt')">manner</a>, for having put too much Water in his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec440.txt')">Wine</a>. Upon
which the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec440.txt')">President</a> of the Day, who is always the Mouth of the
Company, after having convinced him of the Impertinence of his
Passion, and the Insult it had made upon the Company, ordered his Man
to take him from the Table and convey him to the Infirmary. There was
but one more sent away that Day; this was a Gentleman who is reckoned
by some Persons one of the greatest Wits, and by others one of the
greatest Boobies about Town. This you will say is a strange Character,
but what makes it stranger yet, it is a very true one, for he is
perpetually the Reverse of himself, being always merry or dull to
Excess. We brought him hither to divert us, which he did very well
upon the Road, having lavished away as much <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec440.txt')">Wit</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec440.txt')">Laughter</a> upon the
Hackney Coachman as might have served him during his whole Stay here,
had it been duly managed. He had been lumpish for two or three Days,
but was so far connived at, in hopes of Recovery, that we dispatched
one of the briskest Fellows among the Brotherhood into the Infirmary,
for having told him at Table he was not merry. But our President
observing that he indulged himself in this long Fit of Stupidity, and
construing it as a Contempt of the College, ordered him to retire into
the Place prepared for such Companions. He was no sooner got into it,
but his Wit and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec440.txt')">Mirth</a> returned upon him in so violent a manner, that
he shook the whole Infirmary with the Noise of it, and had so good an
Effect upon the rest of the Patients, that he brought them all out to
Dinner with him the next Day.</p><p>'On _Tuesday_ we were no sooner sat down, but one of the Company
complained that his Head aked; upon which another asked him, in an
insolent manner, what he did there then; this insensibly grew into
some warm Words; so that the President, in order to keep the Peace,
gave directions to take them both from the Table, and lodge them in
the Infirmary. Not long after, another of the Company telling us, he
knew by a Pain in his Shoulder that we should have some Rain, the
President ordered him to be removed, and placed as a Weather-glass in
the Apartment above mentioned.</p><p>'On _Wednesday_ a Gentleman having received a Letter written in a
Woman's Hand, and changing Colour twice or thrice as he read it,
desired leave to retire into the Infirmary. The President consented,
but denied him the Use of Pen, Ink and Paper, till such time as he had
slept upon it. One of the Company being seated at the lower end of the
Table, and discovering his secret Discontent by finding fault with
every Dish that was served up, and refusing to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec440.txt')">Laugh</a> at any thing that
was said, the President told him, that he found he was in an uneasie
Seat, and desired him to accommodate himself better in the Infirmary.
After Dinner a very honest Fellow chancing to let a Punn fall from
him, his Neighbour cryed out, _to the Infirmary_; at the same time
pretending to be Sick at it, as having the same Natural Antipathy to a
Punn, which some have to a Cat. This produced a long Debate. Upon the
whole, the Punnster was Acquitted and his Neighbour sent off.</p><p>'On _Thursday_ there was but one Delinquent. This was a Gentleman of
strong Voice, but weak Understanding. He had unluckily engaged himself
in a Dispute with a Man of excellent Sense, but of a modest Elocution.
The Man of Heat replied to every Answer of his Antagonist with a
louder Note than ordinary, and only raised his Voice when he should
have enforced his Argument. Finding himself at length driven to an
Absurdity, he still reasoned in a more clamorous and confused manner,
and to make the greater Impression upon his Hearers, concluded with a
loud Thump upon the Table. The President immediately ordered him to be
carried off, and dieted with Water-gruel, till such time as he should
be sufficiently weakened for Conversation.</p><p>'On _Friday_ there passed very little remarkable, saving only, that
several Petitions were read of the Persons in Custody, desiring to be
released from their Confinement, and vouching for one another's good
Behaviour for the future.</p><p>'On _Saturday_ we received many Excuses from Persons who had found
themselves in an unsociable Temper, and had voluntarily shut
themselves up. The Infirmary was indeed never so full as on this Day,
which I was at some loss to account for, till upon my going Abroad I
observed that it was an Easterly Wind. The Retirement of most of my
Friends has given me Opportunity and Leisure of writing you this
Letter, which I must not conclude without assuring you, that all the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec440.txt')">Members</a> of our College, as well those who are under Confinement, as
those who are at Liberty, are your very humble Servants, tho' none
more than,  _&c._'</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
