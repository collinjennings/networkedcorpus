<p>No. 443.                 Tuesday, July 29, 1712.                Steele</p><p></p><p>'Sublatam ex oculis Qu√¶rimus invidi.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Camilla _to the_ SPECTATOR.</p><p>_Venice, July 10_, N. S.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I Take it extreamly <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec443.txt')">ill</a>, that you do not reckon conspicuous Persons
of your Nation are within your Cognizance, tho' out of the Dominions
of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec443.txt')">Great</a> Britain. I little thought in the green Years of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec443.txt')">Life</a>, that
I should ever <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec443.txt')">call</a> it an Happiness to be out of dear _England_; but as
I grew to Woman, I found my self less acceptable in Proportion to the
Encrease of my <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec443.txt')">Merit</a>. Their Ears in _Italy_ are so differently formed
from the Make of yours in _England_, that I never come upon the Stage,
but a general Satisfaction appears in every Countenance of the whole
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec443.txt')">People</a>. When I dwell upon a Note, I behold all the Men accompanying me
with Heads enclining and falling of their Persons on one Side, as
dying away with me. The Women too do Justice to my Merit, and no
ill-natur'd worthless Creature cries, _The vain Thing_, when I am rapt
up in the Performance of my Part, and sensibly touched with the Effect
my Voice has upon all who hear me. I live here distinguished as one
whom Nature has been liberal to in a graceful Person, an exalted Mein,
and Heavenly Voice. These Particularities in this strange Country, are
Arguments for <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec443.txt')">Respect</a> and Generosity to her who is possessed of them.
The _Italians_ see a thousand Beauties I am sensible I have no
Pretence to, and abundantly make up to me the Injustice I received in
my own Country, of disallowing me what I really had. The Humour of
Hissing, which you have among you, I do not know any thing of; and
their Applauses are uttered in Sighs, and bearing a Part at the
Cadences of Voice with the Persons who are performing. I am often put
in Mind of those complaisant Lines of my own Countryman, [1] when he
is calling all his Faculties together to hear _Arabella_;</p><p>'Let all be hush'd, each softest Motion cease,
Be ev'ry loud tumultuous Thought at Peace;
And ev'ry ruder Gasp of Breath
Be calm, as in the Arms of Death:
And thou, most fickle, most uneasie Part,
Thou restless Wanderer, my Heart,
Be still; gently, ah! gently leave,
Thou busie, idle Thing, to heave.
Stir not a Pulse: and let my Blood,
That turbulent, unruly Flood,
Be softly staid;
Let me be all but my Attention dead.'</p><p>'The whole City of _Venice_ is as still when I am singing, as this
Polite Hearer was to Mrs. _Hunt_. But when they break that Silence,
did you know the Pleasure I am in, when every Man utters his Applause,
by calling me aloud the _Dear Creature_, the _Angel_, the _Venus; What
Attitude she moves with!--Hush, she sings again!_ We have no boistrous
Wits who dare disturb an Audience, and break the publick Peace meerly
to shew they dare. Mr. SPECTATOR, I write this to you thus in Haste,
to tell you I am so very much at ease here, that I know nothing but
Joy; and I will not return, but leave you in _England_ to hiss all
Merit of your own Growth off the Stage. I know, Sir, you were always
my Admirer, and therefore I am yours,
_CAMILLA_. [2]</p><p>P. S. I am ten times better dressed than ever I was in _England_.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'The Project in yours of the 11th Instant, of furthering the
Correspondence and Knowledge of that considerable Part of Mankind, the
Trading <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec443.txt')">World</a>, cannot but be highly commendable. Good Lectures to
young Traders may have very good Effects on their Conduct: but beware
you propagate no false Notions of Trade; let none of your
Correspondents impose on the World, by putting forth base Methods in a
good Light, and glazing them over with improper Terms. I would have no
Means of Profit set for Copies to others, but such as are laudable in
themselves. Let not Noise be called Industry, nor Impudence Courage.
Let not good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec443.txt')">Fortune</a> be imposed on the World for good Management, nor
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec443.txt')">Poverty</a> be called Folly; impute not always Bankruptcy to Extravagance,
nor an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec443.txt')">Estate</a> to Foresight; Niggardliness is not good Husbandry, nor
Generosity Profusion.</p><p>'_Honestus_ is a well-meaning and judicious Trader, hath substantial
Goods, and trades with his own Stock; husbands his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec443.txt')">Money</a> to the best
Advantage, without taking all Advantages of the Necessities of his
Workmen, or grinding the Face of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec443.txt')">Poor</a>. _Fortunatus_ is stocked
with Ignorance, and consequently with Self-Opinion; the Quality of his
Goods cannot but be suitable to that of his Judgment. _Honestus_
pleases discerning People, and keeps their Custom by good Usage; makes
modest Profit by modest Means, to the decent Support of his Family:
Whilst _Fortunatus_ blustering always, pushes on, promising much, and
performing little, with Obsequiousness offensive to People of Sense;
strikes at all, catches much the greater Part; raises a considerable
Fortune by Imposition on others, to the Disencouragement and Ruin of
those who trade in the same Way.</p><p>'I give here but loose Hints, and beg you to be very circumspect in
the Province you have now undertaken: If you perform it successfully,
it will be a very great Good; for nothing is more wanting, than that
Mechanick Industry were set forth with the Freedom and Greatness of
Mind which ought always to accompany a Man of a liberal Education.</p><p>_Your humble Servant,_</p><p>R. C.</p><p>
_From my Shop under the_  Royal-Exchange, July 14.</p><p>_July_ 24, 1712.</p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Notwithstanding the repeated Censures that your Spectatorial Wisdom
has passed upon People more remarkable for Impudence than Wit, there
are yet some remaining, who pass with the giddy Part of Mankind for
sufficient Sharers of the latter, who have nothing but the former
Qualification to recommend them. Another timely Animadversion is
absolutely necessary; be pleased therefore once for all to let these
Gentlemen know, that there is neither Mirth nor Good Humour in hooting
a young Fellow out of Countenance; nor that it will ever constitute a
Wit, to conclude a tart Piece of Buffoonry with a _what makes you
blush?_ Pray please to inform them again, That to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec443.txt')">speak</a> what they know
is shocking, proceeds from ill Nature, and a Sterility of Brain;
especially when the Subject will not admit of Raillery, and their
Discourse has no Pretension to Satyr but what is in their Design to
disoblige. I should be very glad too if you would take Notice, that a
daily Repetition of the same over-bearing Insolence is yet more
insupportable, and a Confirmation of very extraordinary Dulness. The
sudden Publication of this, may have an Effect upon a notorious
Offender of this Kind, whose Reformation would redound very much to the
Satisfaction and Quiet of</p><p>_Your most humble Servant_,</p><p>F.B. [3]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: William Congreve upon Arabella Hunt.]</p><p>
