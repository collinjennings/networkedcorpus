<p>No. 446.                 Friday, August 1, 1712.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Quid deceat, quid non; quò Virtus, quò ferat Error.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Since two or three <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec446.txt')">Writers</a> of <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec446.txt')">Comedy</a> who are now living have taken their
Farewell of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec446.txt')">Stage</a>, those who succeed them finding themselves
incapable of rising up to their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec446.txt')">Wit</a>, <a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec446.txt')">Humour</a> and good Sense, have only
imitated them in some of those loose unguarded Strokes, in which they
complied with the corrupt Taste of the more <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec446.txt')">Vicious</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec446.txt')">Part</a> of their
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec446.txt')">Audience</a>. When Persons of a low <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec446.txt')">Genius</a> attempt this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec446.txt')">kind</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec446.txt')">Writing</a>,
they know no difference between being <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec446.txt')">Merry</a> and being Lewd. It is with
an Eye to some of these degenerate Compositions that I have written the
following Discourse.</p><p>Were our _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec446.txt')">English</a>_ Stage but half so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec446.txt')">virtuous</a> as that of the _Greeks_ or
_Romans_, we should quickly see the Influence of it in the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec446.txt')">Behaviour</a> of
all the Politer Part of Mankind. It would not be fashionable to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec446.txt')">ridicule</a>
Religion, or its Professors; the Man of Pleasure would not be the
compleat Gentleman; Vanity would be out of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec446.txt')">Countenance</a>, and every
Quality which is Ornamental to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec446.txt')">Human</a> Nature, would meet with that Esteem
which is due to it.</p><p>If the _English_ Stage were under the same Regulations the _Athenian_
was formerly, it would have the same Effect that had, in recommending
the Religion, the Government, and Publick Worship of its Country. Were
our Plays subject to proper Inspections and Limitations, we might not
only pass away several of our vacant Hours in the highest
Entertainments; but should always rise from them wiser and better than
we sat down to them.</p><p>It is one of the most unaccountable things in our Age, that the Lewdness
of our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec446.txt')">Theatre</a> should be so much complained of, so well exposed, and so
little redressed. It is to be hoped, that some time or other we may be
at leisure to restrain the Licentiousness of the Theatre, and make it
contribute its Assistance to the Advancement of Morality, and to the
Reformation of the Age. As Matters stand at present, Multitudes are shut
out from this noble Diversion, by reason of those Abuses and Corruptions
that accompany it. A Father is often afraid that his Daughter should be
ruin'd by those Entertainments, which were invented for the
Accomplishment and Refining of Human Nature. The _Athenian_ and _Roman_
Plays were written with such a Regard to Morality, that _Socrates_ used
to frequent the one, and _Cicero_ the other.</p><p>It happened once indeed, that Cato dropped into the _Roman_ Theatre,
when the _Floralia_ were to be represented; and as in that Performance,
which was a kind of Religious Ceremony, there were several indecent
Parts to be acted, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec446.txt')">People</a> refused to see them whilst _Cato_ was
present. _Martial_ on this Hint made the following Epigram, which we
must suppose was applied to some grave <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec446.txt')">Friend</a> of his, that had been
accidentally present at some such Entertainment.</p><p>'Nosces jocosæ dulce cum sacrum Floræ,
Festosque lusus, et licentiam vulgi,
Cur in Theatrum Cato severe venisti?
An ideo tantum veneras, ut exires?</p><p>Why dost thou come, great Censor of the Age,
To see the loose Diversions of the Stage?
With awful Countenance and Brow severe,
What in the Name of Goodness dost thou here?
See the mixt Crowd! how Giddy, Lewd and Vain!
Didst thou come in but to go out again?'</p><p>An Accident of this Nature might happen once in an Age among the
_Greeks_ or _Romans_; but they were too wise and good to let the
constant Nightly Entertainment be of such a Nature, that People of the
most Sense and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec446.txt')">Virtue</a> could not be at it. Whatever Vices are represented
upon the Stage, they ought to be so marked and branded by the Poet, as
not to appear either laudable or amiable in the Person who is tainted
with them. But if we look into the _English_ Comedies above mentioned,
we would think they were formed upon a quite contrary Maxim, and that
this Rule, tho' it held good upon the Heathen Stage, was not be regarded
in Christian Theatres. There is another Rule likewise, which was
observed by <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec446.txt')">Authors</a> of Antiquity, and which these modern Genius's have
no regard to, and that was never to chuse an improper Subject for
Ridicule. Now a Subject is improper for Ridicule, if it is apt to stir
up Horrour and Commiseration rather than <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec446.txt')">Laughter</a>. For this Reason, we
do not find any Comedy in so polite an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec446.txt')">Author</a> as _Terence_, raised upon
the Violations of the Marriage-Bed. The Falshood of the Wife or Husband
has given Occasion to noble Tragedies, but a _Scipio_ or a _Lelius_
would have look'd upon Incest or Murder to have been as proper Subjects
for Comedy. On the contrary, Cuckoldom is the Basis of most of our
Modern Plays. If an Alderman appears upon the Stage, you may be sure it
is in order to be Cuckolded. An Husband that is a little grave or
elderly, generally meets with the same Fate. Knights and Baronets,
Country Squires, and Justices of the _Quorum_, come up to Town for no
other Purpose. I have seen poor _Dogget_ Cuckolded in all these
Capacities. In short, our _English_ Writers are as frequently severe
upon this innocent unhappy Creature, commonly known by the Name of a
Cuckold, as the Ancient Comick Writers were upon an eating Parasite or a
vain-glorious Soldier.</p><p>At the same time the Poet so contrives Matters, that the two Criminals
are the Favourites of the Audience. We sit still, and wish well to them
through the whole <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec446.txt')">Play</a>, are pleased when they meet with proper
Opportunities, and out of humour when they are disappointed. The Truth
of it is, the accomplished Gentleman upon the _English Stage_, is the
Person that is familiar with other Men's Wives, and indifferent to his
own; as the fine Woman is generally a Composition of Sprightliness and
Falshood. I do not know whether it proceeds from Barrenness of
Invention, Depravation of Manners, or Ignorance of Mankind, but I have
often wondered that our ordinary Poets cannot frame to themselves the
Idea of a Fine Man who is not a Whore-master, or of a Fine Woman that is
not a Jilt.</p><p>I have sometimes thought of compiling a System of Ethics out of the
Writings of these corrupt Poets, under the Title of _Stage Morality_.
But I have been diverted from this Thought, by a Project which has been
executed by an ingenious Gentleman of my Acquaintance. He has compos'd,
it seems, the History of a young Fellow, who has taken all his Notions
of the World from the Stage, and who has directed himself in every
Circumstance of his Life and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec446.txt')">Conversation</a>, by the Maxims and Examples of
the Fine Gentlemen in _English_ Comedies. If I can prevail upon him to
give me a Copy of this new-fashioned Novel, I will bestow on it a Place
in my Works, and question not but it may have as good an Effect upon the
Drama, as _Don Quixote_ had upon Romance.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
