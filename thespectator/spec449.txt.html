<p>No. 449.                Tuesday, August 5, 1712.              Steele</p><p></p><p>'--Tibi scriptus, Matrona, libellus--'</p><p>Mart.</p><p></p><p>When I reflect upon my Labours for the Publick, I cannot but observe,
that Part of the Species, of which I profess my self a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec449.txt')">Friend</a> and
Guardian, is sometimes treated with Severity; that is, there are in my
Writings many Descriptions given of ill Persons, and not yet any direct
Encomium made of those who are good. When I was convinced of this Error,
I could not but immediately <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec449.txt')">call</a> to Mind several of the <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec449.txt')">Fair</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec449.txt')">Sex</a> of my
Acquaintance, whose Characters deserve to be transmitted to Posterity in
Writings which will long outlive mine. But I do not think that a Reason
why I should not give them their Place in my Diurnal as long as it will
last. For the Service therefore of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec449.txt')">Female</a> Readers, I shall single out
some Characters of Maids, Wives and Widows, which deserve the Imitation
of the Sex. She who shall lead this small illustrious Number of Heroines
shall be the amiable _Fidelia_.</p><p>Before I enter upon the particular Parts of her Character, it is
necessary to Preface, that she is the only <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec449.txt')">Child</a> of a decrepid <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec449.txt')">Father</a>,
whose Life is bound up in hers. This Gentleman has used _Fidelia_ from
her Cradle with all the Tenderness imaginable, and has view'd her
growing Perfections with the Partiality of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec449.txt')">Parent</a>, that soon thought
her accomplished above the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec449.txt')">Children</a> of all other Men, but never thought
she was come to the utmost Improvement of which she her self was
capable. This Fondness has had very happy Effects upon his own
Happiness, for she reads, she dances, she sings, uses her Spinet and
Lute to the utmost Perfection: And the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec449.txt')">Lady</a>'s Use of all these
Excellencies, is to divert the old Man in his easie Chair, when he is
out of the Pangs of a Chronical Distemper. _Fidelia_ is now in the
twenty third Year of her Age; but the Application of many Lovers, her
vigorous time of Life, her quick Sense of all that is truly gallant and
elegant in the Enjoyment of a plentiful Fortune, are not able to draw
her from the Side of her good old Father. Certain it is, that there is
no kind of Affection so pure and angelick as that of a Father to a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec449.txt')">Daughter</a>. He beholds her both with, and without Regard to her Sex. In
<a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec449.txt')">Love</a> to our Wives there is Desire, to our Sons there is <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec449.txt')">Ambition</a>; but in
that to our Daughters, there is something which there are no Words to
express. Her Life is designed wholly Domestick, and she is so ready a
Friend and Companion, that every thing that passes about a Man, is
accompanied with the Idea of her Presence. Her Sex also is naturally so
much exposed to Hazard, both as to Fortune and Innocence, that there is,
perhaps, a new Cause of Fondness arising from that Consideration also.
None but Fathers can have a true Sense of these sort of Pleasures and
Sensations; but my Familiarity with the Father of _Fidelia_, makes me
let drop the Words which I have heard him <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec449.txt')">speak</a>, and observe upon his
Tenderness towards her.</p><p>_Fidelia_ on her Part, as I was going to say, as accomplished as she is,
with all her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec449.txt')">Beauty</a>, Wit, Air, and Mien, employs her whole Time in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec449.txt')">Care</a>
and Attendance upon her Father. How have I been charmed to see one of
the most beauteous <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec449.txt')">Women</a> the Age has produced on her Knees helping on an
old Man's Slipper! Her filial Regard to him is what she makes her
Diversion, her Business, and her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec449.txt')">Glory</a>. When she was asked by a Friend
of her deceased <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec449.txt')">Mother</a> to admit of the Courtship of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec449.txt')">Son</a>, she
answer'd, That she had a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec449.txt')">great</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec449.txt')">Respect</a> and Gratitude to her for the
Overture in Behalf of one so near to her, but that during her Father's
Life, she would admit into her Heart no Value for any thing that should
interfere with her Endeavour to make his Remains of Life as happy and
easie as could be expected in his Circumstances. The Lady admonished her
of the Prime of Life with a Smile; which _Fidelia_ answered with a
Frankness that always attends unfeigned Virtue. _It is true, Madam,
there is to be sure very great Satisfactions to be expected in the
Commerce of a Man of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec449.txt')">Honour</a>, whom one tenderly loves; but I find so much
Satisfaction in the Reflection, how much I mitigate a good Man's Pains,
whose Welfare depends upon my Assiduity about him, that I wittingly
exclude the loose Gratifications of Passion for the solid Reflections of
Duty. I know not whether any Man's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec449.txt')">Wife</a> would be allow'd, and (what I
still more fear) I know not whether I, a Wife, should be willing to be
as officious as I am at present about my Parent_. The happy Father has
her Declaration that she will not marry during his Life, and the
Pleasure of seeing that Resolution not uneasie to her. Were one to paint
filial Affection in its utmost Beauty, he could not have a more lively
Idea of it than in beholding _Fidelia_ serving her Father at his Hours
of Rising, Meals, and Rest.</p><p>When the general Crowd of Female Youth are consulting their Glasses,
preparing for Balls, Assemblies, or Plays; for a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec449.txt')">young</a> Lady, who could
be regarded among the foremost in those Places, either for her Person,
Wit, Fortune, or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec449.txt')">Conversation</a>, and yet contemn all these Entertainments,
to sweeten the heavy Hours of a decrepid Parent, is a Resignation truly
heroick. _Fidelia_ performs the Duty of a Nurse with all the Beauty of a
Bride; nor does she neglect her Person, because of her Attendance on
him, when he is too ill to receive <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec449.txt')">Company</a>, to whom she may make an
Appearance.</p><p>_Fidelia_, who gives him up her Youth, does not think it any great
Sacrifice to add to it the Spoiling of her Dress. Her Care and Exactness
in her Habit, convince her Father of the Alacrity of her Mind; and she
has of all Women the best Foundation for affecting the Praise of a
seeming Negligence. What adds to the Entertainment of the good old Man
is, that _Fidelia_, where <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec449.txt')">Merit</a> and Fortune cannot be overlook'd by
Epistolary Lovers, reads over the Accounts of her Conquests, plays on
her Spinet the gayest Airs, (and while she is doing so, you would think
her formed only for Gallantry) to intimate to him the Pleasures she
despises for his Sake.</p><p>Those who think themselves the Patterns of good Breeding and Gallantry,
would be astonished to hear that in those Intervals when the old
Gentleman is at Ease, and can bear Company, there are at his House in
the most regular Order, Assemblies of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec449.txt')">People</a> of the highest Merit; where
there is Conversation without Mention of the Faults of the Absent,
Benevolence between Men and Women without Passion, and the highest
Subjects of Morality treated of as natural and accidental Discourse; All
which is owing to the Genius of _Fidelia_, who at once makes her
Father's Way to another <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec449.txt')">World</a> easie, and her self capable of being an
Honour to his Name in this.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I was the other Day at the _Bear-Garden_, in hopes to have seen your
short Face; but not being so fortunate, I must tell you by way of
Letter, That there is a Mystery among the Gladiators which has escaped
your Spectatorial Penetration. For being in a Box at an Ale-house,
near that renowned Seat of Honour above-mentioned, I over-heard two
Masters of the Science agreeing to quarrel on the next Opportunity.
This was to happen in the Company of a Set of the Fraternity of
Basket-Hilts, who were to meet that Evening. When this was settled,
one asked the other, Will you give Cuts or receive? the other
answered, Receive. It was replied, Are you a passionate Man? No,
provided you cut no more nor no deeper than we agree. I thought it my
Duty to acquaint you with this, that the People may not pay their
Money for Fighting, and be cheated.</p><p>_Your Humble Servant_,</p><p>Scabbard Rusty.</p><p></p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
