<p>No. 451.               Thursday, August 7, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Jam sævus apertam
In rabiem cæpit verti jocus, et per honestas
Ire minax impunè domos--'</p><p></p><p>There is nothing so scandalous to a Government, and detestable in the
Eyes of all good Men, as defamatory Papers and Pamphlets; but at the
same time there is nothing so difficult to tame, as a Satyrical <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec451.txt')">Author</a>.
An angry Writer, who cannot appear in Print, naturally vents his Spleen
in Libels and Lampoons. A gay old Woman, says the Fable, seeing all her
Wrinkles represented in a large Looking-glass, threw it upon the Ground
in a Passion, and broke it into a thousand Pieces, but as she was
afterwards surveying the Fragments with a spiteful <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec451.txt')">kind</a> of Pleasure, she
could not forbear uttering her self in the following Soliloquy. What
have I got by this revengeful Blow of mine, I have only multiplied my
Deformity, and see an hundred ugly Faces, where before I saw but one.</p><p>It has been proposed, _to oblige every Person that writes a Book, or a
Paper, to swear himself the Author of it, and enter down in a publick
Register his Name and Place of Abode_.</p><p>This, indeed, would have effectually suppressed all printed Scandal,
which generally appears under borrowed Names, or under none at all. But
it is to be feared, that such an Expedient would not only destroy
Scandal, but Learning. It would operate promiscuously, and root up the
Corn and Tares together. Not to mention some of the most celebrated
Works of Piety, which have proceeded from Anonymous <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec451.txt')">Authors</a>, who have
made it their <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec451.txt')">Merit</a> to convey to us so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec451.txt')">great</a> a Charity in <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec451.txt')">secret</a>: There
are few Works of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec451.txt')">Genius</a> that come out at first with the Author's Name.
The Writer generally makes a Tryal of them in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec451.txt')">World</a> before he owns
them; and, I believe, very few, who are capable of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec451.txt')">Writing</a>, would set
Pen to Paper, if they knew, before-hand, that they must not publish
their Productions but on such Conditions. For my own part, I must
declare, the Papers I present the Publick are like Fairy Favours, which
shall last no longer than while the Author is concealed.</p><p>That which makes it particularly difficult to restrain these Sons of
Calumny and Defamation is, that all Sides are equally <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec451.txt')">guilty</a> of it, and
that every dirty Scribler is countenanced by great Names, whose
Interests he propagates by such vile and infamous Methods. I have never
yet heard of a Ministry, who have inflicted an exemplary Punishment on
an Author that has supported their Cause with Falsehood and Scandal, and
treated, in a most cruel manner, the names of those who have been looked
upon as their Rivals and Antagonists. Would a Government set an
everlasting Mark of their Displeasure upon one of those infamous
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec451.txt')">Writers</a>, who makes his Court to them by tearing to Pieces the Reputation
of a Competitor, we should quickly see an End put to this Race of
Vermin, that are a Scandal to Government, and a Reproach to Human
Nature. Such a Proceeding would make a Minister of State shine in
History, and would fill all Mankind with a just Abhorrence of Persons
who should treat him unworthily, and employ against him those Arms which
he scorned to make use of against his Enemies.</p><p>I cannot think that any one will be so unjust as to imagine, what I have
here said is spoken with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec451.txt')">Respect</a> to any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec451.txt')">Party</a> or Faction. Every one
who has in him the Sentiments either of a Christian or a Gentleman,
cannot but be highly offended at this wicked and ungenerous Practice,
which is so much in use among us at present, that it is become a kind of
National Crime, and distinguishes us from all the Governments that lie
about us. I cannot but look upon the finest Strokes of Satyr which are
aimed at particular Persons, and which are supported even with the
Appearances of Truth, to be the Marks of an evil Mind, and highly
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec451.txt')">Criminal</a> in themselves. Infamy, like other Punishments, is under the
Direction and Distribution of the Magistrate, and not of any private
Person. Accordingly we learn from a Fragment of _Cicero_, that tho'
there were very few Capital Punishments in the twelve Tables, a Libel or
Lampoon which took away the good Name of another, was to be punished by
<a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec451.txt')">Death</a>. But this is far from being our Case. Our Satyr is nothing but
Ribaldry, and _Billingsgate_. Scurrility passes for <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec451.txt')">Wit</a>; and he who can
call Names in the greatest Variety of Phrases, is looked upon to have
the shrewdest Pen. By this Means the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec451.txt')">Honour</a> of Families is ruined, the
highest Posts and greatest Titles are render'd cheap and vile in the
Sight of the People; the noblest Virtues, and most exalted Parts,
exposed to the Contempt of the Vicious and the Ignorant. Should a
Foreigner, who knows nothing of our private Factions, or one who is to
act his Part in the World when our present Heats and Animosities are
forgot, should, I say, such an one form to himself a Notion of the
greatest Men of all Sides in the _British_ Nation, who are now living,
from the Characters which are given them in some or other of those
abominable Writings which are daily Published among us, what a Nation of
Monsters must we appear!</p><p>As this cruel Practice tends to the utter Subversion of all Truth and
Humanity among us, it deserves the utmost Detestation and Discouragement
of all who have either the Love of their Country, or the Honour of their
Religion at <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec451.txt')">Heart</a>. I would therefore earnestly recommend it to the
Consideration of those who deal in these pernicious Arts of Writing; and
of those who take Pleasure in the Reading of them. As for the first, I
have spoken of them in former Papers, and have not stuck to rank them
with the Murderer and Assassin. Every honest Man sets as high a Value
upon a good Name, as upon Life it self; and I cannot but think that
those who privily assault the one, would destroy the other, might they
do it with the same Secrecy and Impunity.</p><p>As for Persons who take Pleasure in the reading and dispersing of such
detestable Libels, I am afraid they fall very little short of the Guilt
of the first Composers. By a Law of the Emperors _Valentinian_ and
_Valens_, it was made Death for any Person not only to write a Libel,
but if he met with one by chance, not to tear or burn it. But because I
would not be thought singular in my Opinion of this Matter, I shall
conclude my Paper with the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec451.txt')">Words</a> of Monsieur _Bayle_, who was a Man of
great Freedom of Thought, as well as of exquisite Learning and Judgment.</p><p>I cannot imagine, that a Man who disperses a Libel is less desirous of
doing Mischief than the Author himself. But what shall we say of the
Pleasure which a Man takes in the reading of a Defamatory Libel? Is it
not an heinous Sin in the Sight of God? We must distinguish in this
Point. This Pleasure is either an agreeable Sensation we are afflicted
with, when we meet with a witty Thought which is well expressed, or it
is a Joy which we conceive from the Dishonour of the Person who is
defamed. I will say nothing to the first of these Cases; for perhaps
some would think that my Morality is not severe enough, if I should
affirm that a Man is not Master of those agreeable Sensations, any
more than of those occasioned by Sugar or Honey, when they touch his
Tongue; but as to the second, every one will own that Pleasure to be a
heinous Sin. The Pleasure in the first Case is of no Continuance; it
prevents our Reason and Reflection, and may be immediately followed by
a secret <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec451.txt')">Grief</a>, to see our Neighbour's Honour blasted. If it does not
cease immediately, it is a Sign that we are not displeased with the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec451.txt')">Ill</a>-nature of the Satyrist, but are glad to see him defame his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec451.txt')">Enemy</a>
by all kinds of Stories; and then we deserve the Punishment to which
the Writer of the Libel is subject. I shall here add the Words of a
Modern Author. _St._ Gregory _upon excommunicating those Writers who
had dishonoured Castorius, does not except those who read their Works;
because_, says he, _if Calumnies have always been the delight of the
Hearers, and a gratification of those Persons who have no other
Advantage over honest Men, is not he who takes Pleasure in reading
them as guilty as he who composed them?_ It is an uncontested Maxim,
that they who approve an Action would certainly do it if they could;
that is, if some Reason of Self-love did not hinder them. There is no
difference, says _Cicero_, between advising a Crime, and approving it
when committed. The _Roman_ Law confirmed this Maxim, having subjected
the Approvers and Authors of this Evil to the same Penalty. We may
therefore conclude, that those who are pleased with reading Defamatory
Libels, so far as to approve the Authors and Dispersers of them, are
as guilty as if they had composed them: for if they do not write such
Libels themselves, it is because they have not the Talent of Writing,
or because they will run no hazard [1].</p><p>The Author produces other Authorities to confirm his Judgment in this
particular.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Dissertation upon Defamatory Libels. §17.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
