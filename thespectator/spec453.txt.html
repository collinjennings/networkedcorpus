<p>No. 453.                Saturday, August 9, 1712.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Non usitatâ nec tenui ferar
Pennâ--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>There is not a more pleasing Exercise of the Mind than Gratitude. It is
accompanied with such an inward Satisfaction, that the Duty is
sufficiently rewarded by the Performance. It is not like the Practice of
many other Virtues, difficult and painful, but attended with so much
Pleasure, that were there no positive Command which enjoin'd it, nor any
Recompence laid up for it hereafter, a generous Mind would indulge in
it, for the natural Gratification that accompanies it.</p><p>If Gratitude is due from <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec453.txt')">Man</a> to Man, how much more from Man to his
Maker? The Supream Being does not only confer upon us those Bounties
which proceed more immediately from his Hand, but even those Benefits
which are conveyed to us by others. Every Blessing we enjoy, by what
Means soever it may be derived upon us, is the Gift of him who is the
great <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec453.txt')">Author</a> of Good, and Father of Mercies.</p><p>If Gratitude, when exerted towards one another, naturally produces a
very pleasing Sensation in the Mind of a Grateful Man; it exalts the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec453.txt')">Soul</a> into Rapture, when it is employed on this great Object of
Gratitude; on this Beneficent Being who has given us every thing we
already possess, and from whom we expect every thing we yet hope for.</p><p>Most of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec453.txt')">Works</a> of the Pagan Poets were either direct Hymns to their
Deities, or tended indirectly to the Celebration of their respective
Attributes and Perfections. Those who are acquainted with the Works of
the Greek and Latin Poets which are still extant, will upon Reflection
find this Observation so true, that I shall not enlarge upon it. One
would wonder that more of our <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec453.txt')">Christian</a> Poets have not turned their
Thoughts this way, especially if we consider, that our Idea of the
Supream Being is not only infinitely more Great and Noble than what
could possibly enter into the Heart of an Heathen, but filled with every
thing that can raise the Imagination, and give an Opportunity for the
sublimest Thoughts and Conceptions.</p><p>_Plutarch_ tells of a Heathen who was singing an Hymn to _Diana_, in
which he celebrated her for her Delight in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec453.txt')">Human</a> Sacrifices, and other
Instances of Cruelty and Revenge; upon which a Poet who was present at
this piece of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec453.txt')">Devotion</a>, and seems to have had a truer Idea of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec453.txt')">Divine</a>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec453.txt')">Nature</a>, told the Votary, by way of Reproof, that in recompence for his
Hymn, he heartily wished he might have a Daughter of the same Temper
with the Goddess he celebrated. It was indeed impossible to write the
Praises of one of those false Deities, according to the Pagan Creed,
without a mixture of Impertinence and Absurdity.</p><p>The _Jews_, who before the Times of Christianity were the only People
that had the Knowledge of the True <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec453.txt')">God</a>, have set the Christian <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec453.txt')">World</a> an
Example how they ought to employ this Divine Talent of which I am
speaking. As that Nation produced Men of great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec453.txt')">Genius</a>, without
considering them as inspired <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec453.txt')">Writers</a>, they have transmitted to us many
Hymns and Divine Odes, which excel those that are delivered down to us
by the Ancient _Greeks_ and _Romans_, in the Poetry, as much as in the
Subject to which it was consecrated. This I think might easily be shewn,
if there were occasion for it.</p><p>I have already communicated to the Publick some Pieces of Divine Poetry,
and as they have met with a very favourable Reception, I shall from time
to time publish any Work of the same nature which has not yet appeared
in Print, [1] and may be acceptable to my Readers.</p><p>
I.    When all thy Mercies, O my God,
My rising Soul surveys;
Transported with the View, I'm lost
In Wonder, Love, and Praise:</p><p>II.   O how shall <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec453.txt')">Words</a> with equal Warmth
The Gratitude declare
That glows within my ravish'd Heart?
But thou canst read it there.</p><p>III.  Thy Providence my Life sustain'd,
And all my Wants redrest,
When in the silent Womb I lay,
And hung upon the Breast.</p><p>IV.   To all my weak Complaints and Cries,
Thy Mercy lent an Ear,
Ere yet my feeble Thoughts had learnt
To form themselves in Pray'r.</p><p>V.    Unnumbered Comforts to my Soul
Thy tender Care bestow'd,
Before my infant Heart conceiv'd
From whom those Comforts flow'd.</p><p>VI.   When in the slippery Paths of Youth
With heedless Steps I ran,
Thine Arm unseen convey'd me safe
And led me up to Man.</p><p>VII.  Through hidden Dangers, Toils, and Deaths,
It gently clear'd my Way,
And through the pleasing Snares of Vice,
More to be fear'd than they.</p><p>VIII. When worn with Sickness oft hast thou
With Health renew'd my Face,
And when in Sins and Sorrows sunk
Revived my Soul with Grace.</p><p>IX.   Thy bounteous Hand with worldly Bliss
Has made my Cup run o'er,
And in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec453.txt')">kind</a> and faithful Friend
Has doubled all my Store.</p><p>X.    Ten thousand thousand precious Gifts
My Daily Thanks employ,
Nor is the least a chearful Heart,
That tastes those Gifts with Joy.</p><p>XI.   Through every Period of my Life
Thy Goodness I'll pursue;
And after Death in distant Worlds
The Glorious Theme renew.</p><p>XII.  When Nature fails, and Day and Night
Divide thy Works no more,
My Ever-grateful Heart, O Lord,
Thy Mercy shall adore.</p><p>XIII. Through all Eternity to Thee
A joyful Song I'll raise,
For oh! Eternity's too short
To utter all thy Praise.</p><p>
