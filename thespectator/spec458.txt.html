<p>No. 458.                  Friday, August 15, 1712.         Addison.</p><p></p><p>[Greek: 'Lidôs ouk agáthae--Hes.]</p><p>--Pudor malus--</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I could not Smile at the Account that was Yesterday given me of a modest
young Gentleman, who being invited to an Entertainment, though he was
not used to drink, had not the Confidence to refuse his Glass in his
Turn, when on a sudden he grew so flustered that he took all the Talk of
the Table into his own Hands, abused every one of the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec458.txt')">Company</a>, and flung
a Bottle at the Gentleman's Head who treated him. This has given me
Occasion to reflect upon the <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec458.txt')">ill</a> Effects of a <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec458.txt')">vicious</a> Modesty, and to
remember the Saying of _Brutus_, as it is quoted by _Plutarch_, that
_the Person has had but an ill Education, who has not been taught to
deny any thing_. This false kind of Modesty has, perhaps, betrayed both
Sexes into as many Vices as the most abandoned Impudence, and is the
more inexcusable to Reason, because it acts to gratify others rather
than it self, and is punished with a kind of Remorse, not only like
other vicious Habits when the Crime is over, but even at the very time
that it is committed.</p><p>Nothing is more amiable than true Modesty, and nothing is more
contemptible than the false. The one guards <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec458.txt')">Virtue</a>, the other betrays
it. True Modesty is ashamed to do any thing that is repugnant to the
Rules of right Reason: False Modesty is ashamed to do any thing that is
opposite to the Humour of the Company. True Modesty avoids every thing
that is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec458.txt')">criminal</a>, false Modesty every thing that is unfashionable. The
latter is only a general undetermined Instinct; the former is that
Instinct, limited and circumscribed by the Rules of Prudence and
Religion.</p><p>We may conclude that Modesty to be false and vicious, which engages a
Man to do any thing that is ill or indiscreet, or which restrains him
from doing any thing that is of a contrary Nature. How many Men, in the
common Concerns of Life, lend Sums of Money which they are not able to
spare, are bound for Persons whom they have but little Friendship for,
give Recommendatory Characters of Men whom they are not acquainted with,
bestow Places on those whom they do not esteem, live in such a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec458.txt')">Manner</a> as
they themselves do not approve, and all this meerly because they have
not the Confidence to resist Solicitation, Importunity or Example?</p><p>Nor does this false Modesty expose us only to such <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec458.txt')">Actions</a> as are
indiscreet, but very often to such as are highly criminal. When
_Xenophanes_ [1] was called timorous, because he would not venture his
Money in a Game at Dice: _I confess_, said he, _that I am exceeding
timorous, for I dare not do any ill thing_. On the contrary, a Man of
vicious Modesty complies with every thing, and is only fearful of doing
what may look singular in the Company where he is engaged. He falls in
with the Torrent, and lets himself go to every <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec458.txt')">Action</a> or Discourse,
however unjustifiable in it self, so it be in Vogue among the present
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec458.txt')">Party</a>. This, tho' one of the most common, is one of the most ridiculous
Dispositions in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec458.txt')">Human</a> Nature, that Men should not be ashamed of speaking
or acting in a dissolute or irrational Manner, but that one who is in
their Company should be ashamed of governing himself by the Principles
of Reason and Virtue.</p><p>
This little Appearance of a Religious Deportment in our Nation, may
proceed in some measure from that Modesty which is natural to us, but
the great occasion of it is certainly this. Those Swarms of Sectaries
that overran the Nation in the time of the great Rebellion, carried
their Hypocrisie so high, that they had converted our whole Language
into a Jargon of Enthusiasm; insomuch that upon the Restoration Men
thought they could not recede too far from the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec458.txt')">Behaviour</a> and Practice of
those Persons, who had made Religion a Cloak to so many Villanies. This
led them into the other Extream, every Appearance of Devotion was looked
upon as Puritannical, and falling into the Hands of the Ridiculers who
flourished in that Reign, and attacked every thing that was Serious, it
has ever since been out of Countenance among us. By this means we are
gradually fallen into that Vicious Modesty which has in some measure
worn out from among us the Appearance of Christianity in Ordinary Life
and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec458.txt')">Conversation</a>, and which distinguishes us from all [our Neighbours.
[2]]</p><p>Hypocrisie cannot indeed be too much detested, but at the same time is
to be preferred to open Impiety. They are both equally destructive to
the Person who is possessed with them; but in regard to others,
Hypocrisie is not so pernicious as bare-faced Irreligion. The due Mean
to be observed is to be sincerely <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec458.txt')">Virtuous</a>, and at the same time to let
the World see we are so. I do not know a more dreadful Menace in the
Holy Writings, than that which is pronounced against those who have this
perverted Modesty, to be ashamed before Men in a Particular of such
unspeakable Importance.</p><p>C. [3]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Xenophon]</p><p>
