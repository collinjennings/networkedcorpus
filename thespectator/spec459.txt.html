<p>No. 459.              Saturday, August 16, 1712.            Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--quicquid dignum sapiente bonoque est.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p><a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec459.txt')">Religion</a> may be considered under two General Heads. The first
comprehends what we are to believe, the other what we are to practise.
By those <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec459.txt')">things</a> which we are to believe, I mean whatever is revealed to
us in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec459.txt')">Holy</a> Writings, and which we could not have obtained the
Knowledge of by the Light of Nature; by the things which we are to
practise, I mean all those Duties to which we are directed by Reason or
Natural Religion. The first of these I shall distinguish by the Name of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec459.txt')">Faith</a>, the Second by that of Morality.</p><p>If we look into the more Serious Part of Mankind, we find many who lay
so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec459.txt')">great</a> a Stress upon Faith, that they neglect Morality; and many who
build so much upon Morality, that they do not pay a due Regard to Faith.
The perfect Man should be defective in neither of these Particulars, as
will be very evident to those who consider the Benefits which arise from
each of them, and which I shall make the Subject of this Day's Paper.</p><p>Notwithstanding this general Division of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec459.txt')">Christian</a> Duty into Morality
and Faith, and that they have both their peculiar Excellencies, the
first has the Pre-eminence in several Respects.</p><p>_First_,    Because the greatest Part of Morality (as I have stated
the Notion of it,) is of a fixt Eternal Nature, and will
endure when Faith shall fail, and be lost in Conviction.</p><p>_Secondly_, Because a Person may be qualified to do greater Good to
Mankind, and become more beneficial to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec459.txt')">World</a>, by
Morality, without Faith, than by Faith without Morality.</p><p>_Thirdly_,  Because Morality gives a greater Perfection to <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec459.txt')">human</a>
Nature, by quieting the Mind, moderating the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec459.txt')">Passions</a>, and
advancing the Happiness of every Man in his private
Capacity.</p><p>_Fourthly_, Because the Rule of Morality is much more certain than
that of Faith, all the Civilized Nations of the World
agreeing in the great Points of Morality, as much as they
differ in those of Faith.</p><p>_Fifthly_,  Because Infidelity is not of so malignant a Nature as
Immorality; or to put the same Reason in another Light,
because it is generally owned, there may be Salvation for
a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec459.txt')">virtuous</a> Infidel, (particularly in the Case of
Invincible Ignorance) but none for a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec459.txt')">vicious</a> Believer.</p><p>_Sixthly_,  Because Faith seems to draw its principal, if not all its
Excellency, from the Influence it has upon Morality; as we
shall see more at large, if we consider wherein consists
the Excellency of Faith, or the Belief of Revealed
Religion; and this I think is,</p><p>_First_,    In explaining and carrying to greater Heights, several
Points of Morality.</p><p>_Secondly_, In furnishing new and stronger Motives to enforce the
Practice of Morality.</p><p>_Thirdly_,  In giving us more amiable Ideas of the Supreme Being,
more endearing Notions of one another, and a truer State
of our selves, both in regard to the Grandeur and
Vileness of our Natures.</p><p>_Fourthly_, By shewing us the Blackness and Deformity of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec459.txt')">Vice</a>, which
in the Christian System is so very great, that he who is
possessed of all Perfection and the Sovereign Judge of
it, is represented by several of our Divines as hating
Sin to the same Degree that he loves the Sacred Person
who was made the Propitiation of it.</p><p>_Fifthly_,  In being the ordinary and prescribed Method of making
Morality effectual to Salvation.</p><p>I have only touched on these several Heads, which every one who is
conversant in Discourses of this Nature will easily enlarge upon in his
own Thoughts, and draw Conclusions from them which may be useful to him
in the Conduct of his Life. One I am sure is so obvious, that he cannot
miss it, namely that a Man cannot be perfect in his Scheme of Morality,
who does not strengthen and support it with that of the Christian Faith.</p><p>Besides this, I shall lay down two or three other Maxims which I think
we may deduce from what has been said.</p><p>_First_,    That we should be particularly cautious of making any
thing an Article of Faith, which does not contribute to
the Confirmation or Improvement of Morality.</p><p>_Secondly_, That no Article of Faith can be true and authentick, which
weakens or subverts the practical part of Religion, or
what I have hitherto called Morality.</p><p>_Thirdly,_  That the greatest Friend of Morality, or Natural Religion,
cannot possibly apprehend any Danger from embracing Christianity, as
it is preserved pure and uncorrupt in the Doctrines of our National
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec459.txt')">Church</a>.</p><p>There is likewise another Maxim which I think may be drawn from the
foregoing Considerations, which is this, that we should, in all dubious
Points, consider any ill Consequences that may arise from them,
supposing they should be Erroneous, before we give up our Assent to
them.</p><p>For example, In that disputable Point of Prosecuting Men for Conscience
Sake, besides the imbittering their Minds with Hatred, Indignation, and
all the Vehemence of Resentment, and ensnaring them to profess what they
do not believe; we cut them off from the Pleasures and Advantages of
Society, afflict their Bodies, distress their Fortunes, hurt their
Reputations, ruin their Families, make their Lives painful, or put an
End to them. Sure when I see such dreadful Consequences rising from a
Principle, I would be as fully convinced of the Truth of it, as of a
Mathematical Demonstration, before I would venture to act upon it, or
make it a part of my Religion.</p><p>In this Case the Injury done our Neighbour is plain and evident, the
Principle that puts us upon doing it, of a dubious and disputable
Nature. Morality seems highly violated by the one, and whether or no a
Zeal for what a Man thinks the true System of Faith may justifie it, is
very uncertain. I cannot but think, if our Religion produce Charity as
well as Zeal, it will not be for shewing it self by such cruel
Instances. But, to conclude with the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec459.txt')">Words</a> of an excellent Author, [1]
_We have just enough Religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us
love, one another._</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Probably Tillotson. The thought is expanded in part of his
sermon on the Example of Jesus in doing good. It appears in another form
in his sermon for the 5th of November, 1678, where he applies to our
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec459.txt')">religious</a> hatreds the saying that 'the richest and noblest wines make
the sharpest vinegar;' again in another form in his sermon at the
Yorkshire Feast.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
