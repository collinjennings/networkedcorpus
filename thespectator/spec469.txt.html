<p>No. 469.             Thursday, August 28, 1712.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Detrahere aliquid altieri, et hominem hominis incommodo suum augere
commodum, magis <a name="topic15" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec469.txt')">est</a> contra naturam, quam mors, quam paupertas, quam
dolor, quam cætera <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec469.txt')">qu</a>æ possunt <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec469.txt')">aut</a> corpori accidere, aut rebus
externis.'</p><p>Tull.</p><p></p><p>I am perswaded there are few Men of generous Principles, who would seek
after <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec469.txt')">great</a> Places, were it not rather to have an Opportunity in their
Hands of obliging their particular Friends, or those whom they look upon
as Men of Worth, than to procure <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec469.txt')">Wealth</a> and <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec469.txt')">Honour</a> for themselves. To an
honest Mind the best Perquisites of a Place are the Advantages it gives
a Man of doing Good.</p><p>Those who are under the great Officers of State, and are the Instruments
by which they act, have more frequent Opportunities for the Exercise of
Compassion, and Benevolence, than their Superiors themselves. These Men
know every little Case that is to come before the Great Man, and if they
are possessed with honest Minds, will consider <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec469.txt')">Poverty</a> as a
Recommendation in the Person who applies himself to them, and make the
Justice of his Cause the most powerful Solicitor in his Behalf. A Man of
this Temper, when he is in a Post of Business, becomes a Blessing to the
Publick: He patronizes the Orphan and the Widow, assists the Friendless,
and guides the Ignorant: He does not reject the Person's Pretensions,
who does not know how to explain them, or refuse doing a good Office for
a Man because he cannot pay the Fee of it. In short, tho' he regulates
himself in all his Proceedings by Justice and Equity, he finds a
thousand [Occasions for all the Good-natured Offices of [1]] Generosity
and Compassion.</p><p>A Man is unfit for such a Place of Trust, who is of a sower untractable
Nature, or has any other Passion that makes him uneasie to those who
approach him. Roughness of Temper is apt to discountenance the Timorous
or Modest. The proud Man discourages those from approaching him, who are
of a mean Condition, and who most want his Assistance. The impatient Man
will not give himself time to be informed of the Matter that lies before
him. An Officer with one or more of these unbecoming Qualities, is
sometimes looked upon as a proper Person to keep off Impertinence and
Solicitation from his Superior; but this is a kind of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec469.txt')">Merit</a>, that can
never attone for the Injustice which may very often arise from it.</p><p>There are two other vicious Qualities which render a Man very unfit for
such a Place of Trust. The first of these is a Dilatory Temper, which
commits innumerable Cruelties without Design. The Maxim which several
have laid down for a Man's Conduct in ordinary <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec469.txt')">Life</a> should be inviolable
with a Man in Office, never to think of doing that To-morrow which may
be done To-day. A Man who defers doing what ought to be done, is guilty
of Injustice so long as he defers it. The Dispatch of a good Office is
very often as beneficial to the Solicitor as the good Office it self. In
short, if a Man compared the Inconveniences which another suffers by his
Delays, with the trifling Motives and Advantages which he himself may
reap by such a Delay, he would never be guilty of a Fault which very
often does an irreparable Prejudice to the Person who depends upon him,
and which might be remedied with little Trouble to himself.</p><p>But in the last Place, there is no Man so improper to be employed in
Business, as he who is in any degree capable of Corruption; and such an
one is the Man, who, upon any Pretence whatsoever, receives more than
what is the stated and unquestioned Fee of his Office. Gratifications,
Tokens of Thankfulness, Dispatch <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec469.txt')">Money</a>, and the like specious Terms, are
the Pretences under which Corruption very frequently shelters it self.
An honest Man will however look on all these Methods as unjustifiable,
and will enjoy himself better in a moderate <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec469.txt')">Fortune</a> that is gained with
honour and Reputation, than in an overgrown <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec469.txt')">Estate</a> that is cankered with
the Acquisitions of Rapine and Exaction. Were all our Offices discharged
with such an inflexible Integrity, we should not see Men in all Ages,
who grow up to exorbitant Wealth with the Abilities which are to be met
with in an ordinary Mechanick. I cannot but think that such a Corruption
proceeds chiefly from Mens employing the first that offer themselves, or
those who have the Character of shrewd worldly Men, instead of searching
out such as have had a liberal Education, and have been trained up in
the Studies of Knowledge and Virtue.</p><p>It has been observed, that Men of Learning who take to Business,
discharge it generally with greater Honesty than Men of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec469.txt')">World</a>. The
chief Reason for it I take to be as follows. A Man that has spent his
Youth in Reading, has been used to find Virtue extolled, and Vice
stigmatized. A Man that has past his Time in the World, has often seen
Vice triumphant, and Virtue discountenanced. Extortion, Rapine and
Injustice, which are branded with Infamy in Books, often give a Man a
Figure in the World; while several Qualities which are celebrated in
Authors, as Generosity, Ingenuity and Good-Nature, impoverish and ruin
him. This cannot but have a proportionable Effect on Men, whose Tempers
and Principles are equally Good and Vicious.</p><p>There would be at least this Advantage in employing Men of Learning and
Parts in Business, that their Prosperity would set more gracefully on
them, and that we should not see many worthless Persons shot up into the
greatest Figures of Life.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [Opportunities of exercising his]]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
