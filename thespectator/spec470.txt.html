<p>No. 470.             Friday, August 29, 1712.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Turpe est difficiles babere nugas,
Et stultus est labor ineptiarum.'</p><p>Mart.</p><p></p><p>I have been very often disappointed of late Years, when upon examining
the new Edition of a Classick <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec470.txt')">Author</a>, I have found above half the Volume
taken up with various Readings. When I have expected to meet with a
learned Note upon a doubtful Passage in a _Latin_ Poet, I have only been
informed, that such or such Ancient Manuscripts for an _et_ write an
_ac_, or of some other notable Discovery of the like Importance. Indeed,
when a different Reading gives us a different Sense, or a new Elegance
in an Author, the Editor does very well in taking Notice of it; but when
he only entertains us with the several ways of spelling the same Word,
and gathers together the various Blunders and Mistakes of twenty or
thirty different Transcribers, they only take up the Time of the learned
Reader, and puzzle the Minds of the Ignorant. I have often fancied with
my self how enraged an old _Latin_ Author would be, should he see the
several Absurdities in Sense and Grammar, which are imputed to him by
some or other of these various Readings. In one he speaks Nonsense; in
another, makes use of a Word that was never heard of: And indeed there
is scarce a Solecism in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec470.txt')">Writing</a> which the best Author is not guilty of,
if we may be at Liberty to read him in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec470.txt')">Words</a> of some Manuscript,
which the laborious Editor has thought fit to examine in the Prosecution
of his Work.</p><p>I question not but the Ladies and pretty Fellows will be very curious to
understand what it is that I have been hitherto talking of. I shall
therefore give them a Notion of this Practice, by endeavouring to write
after the manner of several Persons who make an eminent Figure in the
Republick of Letters. To this end we will suppose that the following
[Song [1]] is an old Ode which I present to the Publick in a new
Edition, with the several various Readings which I find of it in former
Editions, and in Ancient Manuscripts. Those who cannot relish the
various Readings, will perhaps find their Account in the Song, which
never before appeared in Print.</p><p>My <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec470.txt')">Love</a> was fickle once and changing,
Nor e'er would settle in my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec470.txt')">Heart</a>;
From Beauty still to Beauty ranging,
In ev'ry Face I found a Dart.</p><p>'Twas first a charming Shape enslav'd me,
An Eye then gave the fatal Stroke;
'Till by her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec470.txt')">Wit</a>_ Corinna _sav'd me,
And all my former Fetters broke.</p><p>But now a long and lasting Anguish
For_ Belvidera _I endure;
Hourly I Sigh and hourly Languish,
Nor hope to find the wonted Cure.</p><p>For here the false unconstant <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec470.txt')">Lover</a>,
After a thousand Beauties shown,
Does new surprizing Charms discover,
And finds Variety in One.</p><p>
Various Readings.</p><p>Stanza the First, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec470.txt')">Verse</a> the First. And changing.] The _and_ in some
Manuscripts is written thus, _&_, but that in the Cotton Library writes
it in three distinct Letters.</p><p>Verse the Second, Nor e'er would.] Aldus reads it _ever_ would; but as
this would hurt the Metre, we have restored it to its genuine Reading,
by observing that _Syn√¶resis_ which had been neglected by ignorant
Transcribers.</p><p>Ibid. In my Heart.] Scaliger, and others, _on_ my Heart.</p><p>Verse the Fourth, I found a Dart.] The Vatican Manuscript for _I_ reads
_it_, but this must have been the Hallucination of the Transcriber, who
probably mistook the Dash of the I for a T.</p><p>Stanza the Second, Verse the Second. The fatal Stroke.] Scioppius,
Salmasius and many others, for _the_ read _a_, but I have stuck to the
usual Reading.</p><p>Verse the Third, Till by her Wit.] Some Manuscripts have it _his_ Wit,
others _your_, others _their_ Wit. But as I find Corinna to be the Name
of a Woman in other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec470.txt')">Authors</a>, I cannot doubt but it should be _her_.</p><p>Stanza the third, Verse the First. A long and lasting Anguish.] The
German Manuscript reads a lasting _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec470.txt')">Passion</a>_, but the Rhyme will not
admit it.</p><p>Verse the Second. For Belvidera I endure.] Did not all the Manuscripts
reclaim, I should change Belvidera into Pelvidera; Pelvis being used by
several of the Ancient Comick <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec470.txt')">Writers</a> for a Looking-glass, by which
means the Etymology of the Word is very visible, and Pelvidera will
signifie a Lady who often looks in her Glass; as indeed she had very
good reason, if she had all those Beauties which our Poet here ascribes
to her.</p><p>Verse the Third. Hourly I sigh and hourly languish.] Some for the Word
_hourly_ read _daily_, and others _nightly_; the last has great
Authorities of its side.</p><p>Verse the Fourth. The wonted Cure.] The Elder Stevens reads _wanted
Cure_.</p><p>Stanza the Fourth, Verse the Second. After a thousand Beauties] In
several Copies we meet with _a Hundred Beauties_ by the usual Errour of
the Transcribers, who probably omitted a Cypher, and had not Taste
enough to know that the Word _Thousand_ was ten Times a greater
Compliment to the Poet's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec470.txt')">Mistress</a> than an _Hundred_.</p><p>Verse the Fourth. And finds Variety in one] Most of the Ancient
Manuscripts have it _in two_. Indeed so many of them concur in this last
reading, that I am very much in doubt whether it ought not to take
place. There are but two Reasons which incline me to the Reading as I
have published it; First, because the Rhime, and, Secondly, because the
Sense is preserved by it. It might likewise proceed from the Oscitancy
of Transcribers, who, to dispatch their Work the sooner, use to write
all Numbers in Cypher, and seeing the Figure 1 following by a little
Dash of the Pen, as is customary in old Manuscripts, they perhaps
mistook the Dash for a second Figure, and by casting up both together
composed out of them the Figure 2. But this I shall leave to the
Learned, without determining any thing in a Matter of so great
Uncertainty.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [Song, which by the way is a beautiful Descant upon a
single Thought, like the Compositions of the best Ancient Lyrick Poets,
