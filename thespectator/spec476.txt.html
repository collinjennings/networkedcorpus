<p>No. 476.               Friday, September 5, 1712.            Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--lucidus Ordo--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Among my Daily-Papers which I bestow on the Publick, there are some
which are written with Regularity and Method, and others that run out
into the Wildness of those Compositions which go by the Names of
_Essays_. As for the first, I have the whole Scheme of the Discourse in
my Mind before I set Pen to Paper. In the other <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec476.txt')">kind</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec476.txt')">Writing</a>, it is
sufficient that I have several Thoughts on a Subject, without troubling
my self to range them in such order, that they may seem to grow out of
one another, and be disposed under the proper Heads. _Seneca_ and
_Montaigne_ are Patterns for Writing in this last kind, as _Tully_ and
_Aristotle_ excel in the other. When I read an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec476.txt')">Author</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec476.txt')">Genius</a> who
writes without Method, I fancy myself in a Wood that abounds with a
<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec476.txt')">great</a> many noble Objects, rising among one another in the greatest
Confusion and Disorder. When I read a methodical Discourse, I am in a
regular Plantation, and can place my self in its several Centres, so as
to take a view of all the Lines and Walks that are struck from them. You
may ramble in the one a whole Day together, and every Moment discover
something or other that is new to you; but when you have done, you will
have but a confused imperfect Notion of the Place: In the other, your
Eye commands the whole Prospect, and gives you such an Idea of it, as is
not easily worn out of the Memory.</p><p>Irregularity and want of Method are only supportable in Men of great
Learning or Genius, who are often too full to be exact, and therefore
chuse to throw down their Pearls in Heaps before the Reader, rather than
be at the Pains of stringing them.</p><p>Method is of advantage to a Work, both in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec476.txt')">respect</a> to the Writer and the
Reader. In regard to the first, it is a great help to his Invention.
When a <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec476.txt')">Man</a> has plann'd his Discourse, he finds a great many Thoughts
rising out of every Head, that do not offer themselves upon the general
Survey of a Subject. His Thoughts are at the same time more
intelligible, and better discover their Drift and Meaning, when they are
placed in their proper Lights, and follow one another in a regular
Series, than when they are thrown together without Order and Connexion.
There is always an Obscurity in Confusion, and the same Sentence that
would have enlightened the Reader in one part of a Discourse, perplexes
him in another. For the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec476.txt')">reason</a> likewise every Thought in a
methodical Discourse shews [it [1]] self in its greatest Beauty, as the
several Figures in a piece of Painting receive new Grace from their
Disposition in the Picture. The Advantages of a Reader from a methodical
Discourse, are correspondent with those of the Writer. He comprehends
every thing easily, takes it in with Pleasure, and retains it long.</p><p>Method is not less requisite in ordinary <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec476.txt')">Conversation</a> than in Writing,
provided a Man would talk to make himself understood. I, who hear a
thousand Coffee-house Debates every Day, am very sensible of this want
of Method in the Thoughts of my honest Countrymen. There is not one
Dispute in ten which is managed in those Schools of Politicks, where,
after the three first Sentences, the Question is not entirely lost. Our
Disputants put me in mind of the Cuttle-Fish, that when he is unable to
extricate himself, blackens all the Water about him till he becomes
invisible. The Man who does not know how to methodize his Thoughts, has
always, to borrow a Phrase from the Dispensary, _a barren Superfluity of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec476.txt')">Words</a>;_ [2] the Fruit is lost amidst the Exuberance of Leaves.</p><p>_Tom Puzzle_ is one of the most Eminent Immethodical Disputants of any
that has fallen under my Observation. _Tom_ has read enough to make him
very Impertinent; his Knowledge is sufficient to raise Doubts, but not
to clear them. It is pity that he has so much Learning, or that he has
not a great deal more. With these Qualifications _Tom_ sets up for a
Free-thinker, finds a great many <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec476.txt')">things</a> to blame in the Constitution of
his Country, and gives shrewd Intimations that he does not believe
another <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec476.txt')">World</a>. In short, _Puzzle_ is an Atheist as much as his Parts
will give him leave. He has got about half a dozen common-place Topicks,
into which he never fails to turn the Conversation, whatever was the
Occasion of it: Tho' the matter in debate be about _Doway_ or _Denain_,
it is ten to one but half his Discourse runs upon the Unreasonableness
of Bigottry and Priest-craft. This makes Mr. _Puzzle_ the Admiration of
all those who have less Sense than himself, and the Contempt of those
who have more. There is none in Town whom _Tom_ dreads so much as my
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec476.txt')">Friend</a> _Will Dry_. _Will_, who is acquainted with _Tom's_ Logick, when
he finds him running off the Question, cuts him short with a _What then?
We allow all this to be true, but what is it to our present Purpose?_ I
have known _Tom_ eloquent half an hour together, and triumphing, as he
thought, in the Superiority of the Argument, when he has been non-plus'd
on a sudden by Mr. _Dry's_ desiring him to tell the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec476.txt')">Company</a> what it was
that he endeavoured to prove. In short, _Dry_ is a Man of a clear
methodical Head, but few Words, and gains the same Advantage over
_Puzzle_, that a small <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec476.txt')">Body</a> of regular Troops would gain over a
numberless undisciplined Militia.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [its]]</p><p>
