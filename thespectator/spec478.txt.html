<p>No. 478.               Monday, September 8, 1712.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>'--Usus
Quem penes Arbitrium est, et Jus et Norma--'</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>It happened lately, that a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec478.txt')">Friend</a> of mine, who had many <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec478.txt')">things</a> to buy
for his Family, would oblige me to walk with him to the Shops. He was
very nice in his way, and fond of having every thing shewn, which at
first made me very uneasy; but as his Humour still continu'd, the
things which I had been staring at along with him, began to fill my
<a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec478.txt')">Head</a>, and led me into a Set of amusing Thoughts concerning them.</p><p>I fancied it must be very surprizing to any one who enters into a
detail of Fashions, to consider how far the Vanity of Mankind has laid
it self out in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec478.txt')">Dress</a>, what a prodigious number of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec478.txt')">People</a> it maintains,
and what a Circulation of <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec478.txt')">Money</a> it occasions. Providence in this Case
makes use of the Folly which we will not give up, and it becomes
instrumental to the Support of those who are willing to labour. Hence
it is that Fringe-Makers, Lace-Men, Tire-Women, and a number of other
Trades, which would be useless in a simple State of Nature, draw their
Subsistence; tho' it is seldom seen that such as these are extremely
rich, because their original Fault of being founded upon Vanity, keeps
them <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec478.txt')">poor</a> by the light Inconstancy of its Nature. The Variableness of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec478.txt')">Fashion</a> turns the Stream of Business which flows from it now into one
Channel, and anon into another; so that different Sets of People sink
or flourish in their turns by it.</p><p>From the Shops we retir'd to the Tavern, where I found my Friend
express so much satisfaction for the Bargains he had made, that my
moral Reflections, (if I had told them) might have pass'd for a
Reproof; so I chose rather to fall in with him, and let the Discourse
run upon the use of Fashions.</p><p>Here we remembred how much Man is govern'd by his Senses, how lively
he is struck by the Objects which appear to him in an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec478.txt')">agreeable</a>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec478.txt')">manner</a>, how much Clothes contribute to make us agreeable Objects, and
how much we owe it to our selves that we should appear so.</p><p>We considered Man as belonging to Societies; Societies as form'd of
different Ranks; and different Ranks distinguished by Habits, that all
proper Duty or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec478.txt')">Respect</a> might attend their Appearance.</p><p>We took notice of several Advantages which are met with in the
Occurrences of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec478.txt')">Conversation</a>. How the bashful Man has been sometimes so
rais'd, as to express himself with an Air of Freedom, when he imagines
that his Habit introduces him to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec478.txt')">Company</a> with a becoming Manner: And
again, how a Fool in fine Clothes shall be suddenly heard with
Attention, till he has betray'd himself; whereas a Man of Sense
appearing with a Dress of Negligence, shall be but coldly received,
till he be proved by Time, and established in a Character. Such things
as these we cou'd recollect to have happen'd to our knowledge so very
often, that we concluded the Author had his Reasons, who advises his
Son to go in Dress rather above his Fortune than under it.</p><p>At last the Subject seem'd so considerable, that it was proposed to
have a Repository built for Fashions, as there are Chambers for Medals
and other Rarities. The Building may be shap'd as that which stands
among the Pyramids, in the Form of a Woman's Head. This may be rais'd
upon Pillars, whose Ornaments shall bear a just relation to the
Design. Thus there may be an Imitation of Fringe carv'd in the Base, a
sort of Appearance of Lace in the Frieze, and a Representation of
curling Locks, with Bows of Ribband sloping over them, may fill up the
Work of the Cornish. The Inside may be divided into two Apartments
appropriated to each Sex. The Apartments may be fill'd with Shelves,
on which Boxes are to stand as regularly as Books in a Library. These
are to have Folding-Doors, which being open'd, you are to behold a
Baby <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec478.txt')">dressed</a> out in some Fashion which has flourish'd, and standing
upon a Pedestal, where the time of its Reign is mark'd down. For its
further Regulation, let it be order'd, that every one who invents a
Fashion shall bring in his Box, whose Front he may at pleasure have
either work'd or painted with some amorous or gay Device, that, like
Books with gilded Leaves and Covers, it may the sooner draw the Eyes
of the Beholders. And to the end that these may be preserv'd with all
due Care, let there be a Keeper appointed, who shall be a Gentleman
qualify'd with a competent Knowledge in Clothes; so that by this means
the Place, will be a comfortable Support for some Beau who has spent
his Estate in dressing.</p><p>The Reasons offer'd by which we expected to gain the Approbation of
the Publick, were as follows.</p><p>First, That every one who is considerable enough to be a Mode, and has
any Imperfection of Nature or Chance, which it is possible to hide by
the Advantage of Clothes, may, by coming to this Repository, be
furnish'd her self, and furnish all who are under the same Misfortune,
with the most agreeable Manner of concealing it; and that on the other
side, every one who has any Beauty in Face or Shape, may also be
furnished with the most agreeable Manner of shewing it.</p><p>Secondly, That whereas some of our young Gentlemen who travel, give us
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec478.txt')">great</a> reason to suspect that they only go abroad to make or improve a
Fancy for Dress, a Project of this nature may be a means to keep them
at home, which is in effect the keeping of so much Money in the
Kingdom. And perhaps the Balance of Fashion in _Europe_, which now
leans upon the side of _France_, may be so alter'd for the future,
that it may become as common with _Frenchmen_ to come to _England_ for
their finishing Stroke of Breeding, as it has been for _Englishmen_ to
go to _France_ for it.</p><p>Thirdly, Whereas several great Scholars, who might have been otherwise
useful to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec478.txt')">World</a>, have spent their time in studying to describe the
Dresses of the Ancients from dark Hints, which they are fain to
interpret and support with much Learning, it will from henceforth
happen, that they shall be freed from the Trouble, and the World from
useless Volumes. This Project will be a Registry, to which Posterity
may have recourse, for the clearing such obscure Passages as tend that
way in Authors; and therefore we shall not for the future submit our
selves to the Learning of Etymology, which might persuade the Age to
come, that the Farthingal was worn for Cheapness, or the Furbeloe for
Warmth.</p><p>Fourthly, Whereas they who are old themselves, have often a way of
railing at the Extravagance of Youth, and the whole Age in which their
Children live; it is hoped that this ill Humour will be much
suppress'd, when we can have recourse to the Fashions of their Times,
produce them in our Vindication, and be able to shew that it might
have been as expensive in Queen _Elizabeth's_ time only to wash and
quill a Ruff, as it is now to buy Cravats or Neck-Handkerchiefs.</p><p>We desire also to have it taken Notice of, That because we would shew
a particular respect to Foreigners, which may induce them to perfect
their Breeding here in a Knowledge which is very proper for pretty
Gentlemen, we have conceived the Motto for the House in the Learned
Language. There is to be a Picture over the Door, with a Looking-Glass
and a Dressing-Chair in the Middle of it: Then on one side are to be
seen, above one another, Patch-Boxes, Pin-Cushions, and little
Bottles; on the other, Powder Baggs, Puffs, Combs and Brushes; beyond
these, Swords with fine Knots, whose Points are hidden, and Fans
almost closed, with the Handles downward, are to stand out
interchangeably from the Sides till they meet at the Top, and form a
Semicircle over the rest of the Figures: Beneath all, the Writing is
to run in this pretty sounding Manner:</p><p>'Adeste, O quotquot sunt, Veneres, Grati√¶, Cupidines, [1]
En vobis adsunt in promptu
Faces, Vincula, Spicula,
Hinc eligite, sumite, regite.'</p><p>I am, Sir,
Your most humble Servant,
_A. B_.</p><p>
The Proposal of my Correspondent I cannot but look upon as an ingenious
Method of placing Persons (whose Parts make them ambitious to exert
themselves in frivolous things) in a Rank by themselves. In order to
this, I would propose, That there be a Board of Directors of the
fashionable Society; and because it is a Matter of too much Weight for a
private Man to determine alone, I should be highly obliged to my
Correspondents if they would give in Lists of Persons qualify'd for this
Trust. If the chief Coffee-houses, the Conversations of which Places are
carry'd on by Persons, each of whom has his little number of Followers
and Admirers, would name from among themselves two or three to be
inserted, they should be put up with great Faithfulness. Old Beaus are
to be presented in the first place; but as that Sect, with relation to
Dress, is almost extinct, it will, I fear, be absolutely necessary to
take in all Time-Servers, properly so deem'd; that is, such as, without
any Conviction of Conscience or View of Interest, change with the World,
and that merely from a Terror of being out of Fashion. Such also, who
from Facility of Temper, and too much Obsequiousness, are vicious
against their Will, and follow Leaders whom they do not approve, for
Want of Courage to go their own Way, are capable Persons for this
Superintendency. Those who are both to grow old, or would do any thing
contrary to the Course and Order of things, out of Fondness to be in
Fashion, are proper Candidates. To conclude, those who are in Fashion
without apparent <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec478.txt')">Merit</a>, must be supposed to have latent Qualities, which
would appear in a Post of Direction; and therefore are to be regarded in
forming these Lists. Any who shall be pleased, according to these, or
what further Qualifications may occur to himself, to send a List, is
desired to do it within fourteen days after this Date.</p><p>N. B. _The Place of the Physician to this Society, according to the last
mentioned Qualification, is already engag'd._</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1:</p><p>'All ye Venuses, Graces, and Cupids, attend:
See prepared to your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec478.txt')">hands</a>
