<p>No. 489.             Saturday, September 20, 1712.             Addison.</p><p></p><p>[Greek: Bathyrrheítao méga sthénos 'Ôkeaneio]--Hom.</p><p></p><p>SIR,</p><p>Upon reading your _Essay_ concerning the <a name="topic21" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec489.txt')">Pleasures</a> of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec489.txt')">Imagination</a>,
I find, among the three Sources of those Pleasures which you have
discovered, [that] _Greatness_ is one. This has suggested to me the
<a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec489.txt')">reason</a> why, of all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec489.txt')">Objects</a> that I have ever seen, there is none which
affects my Imagination so much as the Sea or Ocean. I cannot see the
Heavings of this prodigious Bulk of Waters, even in a Calm, without a
very pleasing Astonishment; but when it is worked up in a Tempest, so
that the Horizon on every side is nothing but foaming Billows and
floating Mountains, it is impossible to describe the agreeable Horrour
that rises from such a Prospect. A troubled Ocean, to a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec489.txt')">Man</a> who sails
upon it, is, I think, the biggest Object that he can see in motion,
and consequently gives his Imagination one of the highest kinds of
Pleasure that can arise from Greatness. I must confess, it is
impossible for me to survey this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec489.txt')">World</a> of fluid Matter, without
thinking on the Hand that first poured it out, and made a proper
Channel for its Reception. Such an Object naturally raises in my
Thoughts the Idea of an Almighty Being, and convinces me of his
Existence as much as a metaphysical Demonstration. The Imagination
prompts the Understanding, and by the Greatness of the sensible
Object, produces in it the Idea of a Being who is neither
circumscribed by Time nor Space.</p><p>As I have made several Voyages upon the Sea, I have often been tossed
in Storms, and on that occasion have frequently reflected on the
Descriptions of them in ancient Poets. I remember _Longinus_ highly
recommends one in _Homer_, because the Poet has not amused himself
with little Fancies upon the occasion, as Authors of an inferiour
Genius, whom he mentions, had done, but because he has gathered
together those Circumstances which are the most apt to terrify the
Imagination, and which really happen in the raging of a Tempest. [1]
It is for the same reason, that I prefer the following <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec489.txt')">Description</a> of
a Ship in a Storm, which the Psalmist has made, before any other I
have ever met with.</p><p>'They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do Business in great
Waters: These see the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec489.txt')">Works</a> of the Lord, and his Wonders in the
Deep. For he commandeth and raiseth the stormy Wind, which lifteth
up the Waters thereof. They mount up to the Heaven, they go down
again to the Depths, their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec489.txt')">Soul</a> is melted because of Trouble. They
reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken Man, and are at their
Wits End. Then they cry unto the Lord in their Trouble, and he
bringeth them out of their Distresses. He maketh the Storm a Calm,
so that the Waves thereof are still. Then they are glad because they
be quiet, so he bringeth them unto their desired Haven.' [2]</p><p>By the way, how much more comfortable, as well as rational, is this
System of the Psalmist, than the Pagan Scheme in _Virgil_, and other
Poets, where one Deity is represented as raising a Storm, and another
as laying it? Were we only to consider the Sublime in this Piece of
Poetry, what can be nobler than the Idea it gives us of the Supreme
Being thus raising the Tumult among the Elements, and recovering them
out of their Confusion; thus troubling and becalming <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec489.txt')">Nature</a>?</p><p>Great Painters do not only give us Landskips of Gardens, Groves, and
Meadows, but very often employ their Pencils upon Sea-Pieces: I could
wish you would follow their Example. If this small Sketch may deserve
a Place among your Works, I shall accompany it with a divine Ode, made
by a Gentleman [3] upon the Conclusion of his Travels.</p><p>
I.      How are thy Servants blest, O Lord!
How sure is their Defence!
Eternal Wisdom is their Guide,
Their Help Omnipotence.</p><p>
II.     In foreign Realms, and Lands remote,
Supported by thy Care,
Thro' burning Climes I pass'd unhurt,
And breath'd in tainted Air.</p><p>
III.    Thy Mercy sweeten'd ev'ry Soil,
Made ev'ry Region please;
The hoary Alpine Hills it warm'd,
And smooth'd the Tyrrhene Seas:</p><p>
IV.     Think, O my Soul, devoutly think,
How with affrighted Eyes
Thou saw'st the wide extended Deep
In all its Horrors rise!</p><p>
V.      Confusion dwelt in ev'ry Face,
And <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec489.txt')">Fear</a> in ev'ry <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec489.txt')">Heart</a>;
When Waves on Waves, and Gulphs in Gulphs,
O'ercame the Pilot's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec489.txt')">Art</a>.</p><p>
VI.     Yet then from all my Griefs, O Lord,
Thy Mercy set me free,
Whilst in the Confidence of Pray'r
My Soul took hold on thee;</p><p>
VII.    For tho' in dreadful Whirles we hung
High on the broken Wave,
I knew thou wert not slow to Hear,
Nor impotent to Save.</p><p>
VIII.   The Storm was laid, the Winds retir'd,
Obedient to thy Will;
The Sea that roar'd at thy Command,
At thy Command was still.</p><p>
IX.     In midst of Dangers, Fears and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec489.txt')">Death</a>,
Thy Goodness I'll adore,
And praise Thee for Thy Mercies past;
And humbly hope for more.</p><p>
X.      My Life, if thou preserv'st my Life,
Thy Sacrifice shall be;
And Death, if Death must be my Doom,
Shall join my Soul to thee.</p><p>
O. [4]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: On the Sublime, § 10, where he compares a description of
the terrors of the sea in a lost poem on the Arimaspians, by Aristaeus
the Procomnesian, with the passage in the 15th Book of the Iliad, which
Pope thus translates:</p><p>'He bursts upon them all:
Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,
And swell'd with tempests on the ship descends;
White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud
Howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud:
Pale, trembling, tir'd, the sailors freeze with fears,
And instant death on every wave appears.']</p><p>
[Footnote 2: Psalm cvii. 23-30.]</p><p>
[Footnote 3: Addison.]</p><p>
[Footnote 4: Appended to this number is the following</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT.</p><p>The Author of the_ SPECTATOR _having received the Pastoral Hymn in his
441st Paper, set to Musick by one of the most Eminent Composers of our
own <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec489.txt')">Country</a> and by a Foreigner, who has not put his name to his
ingenious Letter, thinks himself obliged to return his thanks to those
Gentlemen for the Honour they have done him.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
