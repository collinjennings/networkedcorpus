<p>No. 490.             Monday, September 22, 1712.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Domus et placens Uxor.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I have very long entertain'd an <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec490.txt')">Ambition</a> to make the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec490.txt')">Word</a> _<a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec490.txt')">Wife</a>_ the
most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec490.txt')">agreeable</a> and delightful Name in Nature. If it be not so in it
self, all the wiser Part of Mankind from the Beginning of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec490.txt')">World</a> to
this Day has consented in an Error: But our Unhappiness in _England_ has
been, that a few loose Men of <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec490.txt')">Genius</a> for Pleasure, have turn'd it all to
the Gratification of ungovern'd Desires, in spite of good Sense, Form
and Order; when, in truth, any Satisfaction beyond the Boundaries of
Reason, is but a Step towards Madness and Folly. But is the Sense of Joy
and Accomplishment of Desire no way to be indulged or attain'd? and have
we Appetites given us not to be at all gratify'd? Yes certainly.
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec490.txt')">Marriage</a> is an Institution calculated for a constant Scene of as much
Delight as our Being is capable of. Two Persons who have chosen each
other out of all the Species, with design to be each other's mutual
Comfort and Entertainment, have in that Action bound themselves to be
good-humour'd, affable, discreet, forgiving, patient and joyful, with
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec490.txt')">respect</a> to each other's Frailties and Perfections, to the End of their
Lives. The wiser of the two (and it always happens one of them is such)
will for her or his own sake, keep <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec490.txt')">things</a> from Outrage with the utmost
Sanctity. When this Union is thus preserved (as I have often said) the
most indifferent Circumstance administers Delight. Their Condition is an
endless Source of new Gratifications. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec490.txt')">married</a> Man can say, If I am
unacceptable to all the World beside, there is one whom I entirely <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec490.txt')">love</a>,
that will receive me with Joy and Transport, and think herself obliged
to double her Kindness and Caresses of me from the Gloom with which she
sees me overcast. I need not dissemble the Sorrow of my Heart to be
agreeable there, that very Sorrow quickens her Affection.</p><p>This Passion towards each other, when once well fixed, enters into the
very Constitution, and the Kindness flows as easily and silently as the
Blood in the Veins. When this Affection is enjoy'd in the most sublime
Degree, unskilful Eyes see nothing of it; but when it is subject to be
chang'd, and has an Allay in it that may make it end in Distaste, it is
apt to break into Rage, or overflow into Fondness, before the rest of
the World.</p><p>_Uxander_ and _Viramira_ are amorous and young, and have been married
these two Years; yet do they so much distinguish each other in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec490.txt')">Company</a>,
that in your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec490.txt')">Conversation</a> with the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec490.txt')">Dear</a> Things you are still put to a
Sort of Cross-Purposes. Whenever you address your self in ordinary
Discourse to _Viramira_, she turns her Head another way, and the Answer
is made to the dear _Uxander_: If you tell a merry Tale, the Application
is still directed to her Dear; and when she should commend you, she says
to him, as if he had spoke it, That is, my Dear, so pretty--This puts
me in mind of what I have somewhere read in the admired Memoirs of the
famous _Cervantes_, where, while honest _Sancho Pan√ßa_ is putting some
necessary humble Question concerning _Rozinante_, his Supper, or his
Lodgings, the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance is ever improving the
harmless lowly Hints of his Squire to the poetical Conceit, Rapture and
Flight, in Contemplation of the dear _Dulcinea_ of his Affections.</p><p>On the other side, _Dictamnus_ and _Moria_ are ever squabbling, and you
may observe them all the time they are in Company in a State of
Impatience. As _Uxander_ and _Viramira_ wish you all gone, that they may
be at freedom for Dalliance; _Dictamnus_ and _Moria_ wait your Absence,
that they may <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec490.txt')">speak</a> their harsh Interpretations on each other's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec490.txt')">Words</a>
and Actions during the time you were with them.</p><p>It is certain that the greater Part of the Evils attending this
Condition of Life, arises from Fashion. Prejudice in this Case is turn'd
the wrong way, and instead of expecting more Happiness than we shall
meet with in it, we are laugh'd into a Prepossession, that we shall be
disappointed if we hope for lasting Satisfactions.</p><p>With all Persons who have made good Sense the Rule of Action, Marriage
is describ'd as the State capable of the highest human Felicity. _Tully_
has Epistles full of affectionate Pleasure, when he writes to his Wife,
or speaks of his Children. But above all the Hints of this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec490.txt')">kind</a> I have
met with in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec490.txt')">Writers</a> of ancient date, I am pleas'd with an Epigram of
_Martial_ [1] in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec490.txt')">honour</a> of the Beauty of his Wife _Cleopatra_.
Commentators say it was written the day after his Wedding-Night. When
his Spouse was retir'd to the Bathing-room in the Heat of the Day, he,
it seems, came in upon her when she was just going into the Water. To
her Beauty and Carriage on this occasion we owe the following Epigram,
which I shew'd my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec490.txt')">Friend</a> WILL. HONEYCOMB in _French_, who has translated
it as follows, without understanding the Original. I expect it will
please the _English_ better than the _Latin_ Reader.</p><p>'When my bright Consort, now nor Wife nor Maid,
Asham'd and wanton, of Embrace afraid,
Fled to the Streams, the Streams my Fair betray'd;
To my fond Eyes she all transparent stood,
She blush'd, I smil'd at the slight covering Flood.
Thus thro' the Glass the Lovely Lilly glows,
Thus thro' the ambient Gem shines forth the Rose.
I saw new Charms, and plung'd to seize my Store,
Kisses I snatch'd, the Waves prevented more.'</p><p>My Friend would not allow that this luscious Account could be given of a
Wife, and therefore used the Word _Consort_; which, he learnedly said,
would serve for a Mistress as well, and give a more Gentlemanly Turn to
the Epigram. But, under favour of him and all other such fine Gentlemen,
I cannot be persuaded but that the Passion a Bridegroom has for a
virtuous young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec490.txt')">Woman</a>, will, by little and little, grow into Friendship,
and then it is ascended to [a [2]] higher Pleasure than it was in its
first Fervour. Without this happens, he is a very unfortunate Man who
has enter'd into this State, and left the Habitudes of Life he might
have enjoy'd with a faithful Friend. But when the Wife proves capable of
filling serious as well as joyous Hours, she brings Happiness unknown to
Friendship itself. _Spencer_ speaks of each kind of Love with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec490.txt')">great</a>
Justice, and attributes the highest Praise to Friendship; and indeed
there is no disputing that Point, but by making that Friendship take
[Place [3]] between two married Persons.</p><p>'Hard is the Doubt, and difficult to deem,
When all three kinds of Love together meet,
And to dispart the Heart with Power extreme,
Whether shall weigh the Ballance down; to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec490.txt')">wit</a>,
The dear Affection unto Kindred <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec490.txt')">sweet</a>,
Or raging Fire of Love to Womenkind,
Or Zeal of Friends combin'd by Virtues meet.
But, of them all, the Band of virtuous Mind
Methinks the gentle Heart should most assured bind.</p><p>For natural Affection soon doth cease,
And quenched is with_ Cupid's _greater Flame;
But faithful Friendship doth them both suppress,
And them with mastering Discipline does tame,
Through Thoughts aspiring to eternal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec490.txt')">Fame</a>.
For as the Soul doth rule the Earthly Mass,
And all the Service of the Body frame;
So Love of Soul doth Love of Body pass,
No less than perfect Gold surmounts the meanest Brass.'</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Lib. iv. ep. 22.]</p><p>
