<p>No. 492.               Wednesday, September 24, 1712.          Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Quicquid est boni moris Levitate extinguiter.'</p><p>Sen.</p><p></p><p>_Tunbridge, Sept. 18._</p><p>_Dear Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I am a <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec492.txt')">young</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec492.txt')">Woman</a> of Eighteen Years of Age, and, I do assure you, a
Maid of unspotted Reputation, founded upon a very careful Carriage in
all my Looks, Words and Actions. At the same time I must own to you,
that it is with much constraint to Flesh and Blood that my <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec492.txt')">Behaviour</a>
is so strictly irreproachable; for I am naturally addicted to Mirth,
to Gaiety, to a Free Air, to Motion and Gadding. Now what gives me a
<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec492.txt')">great</a> deal of Anxiety, and is some Discouragement in the Pursuit of
Virtue, is, that the young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec492.txt')">Women</a> who run into greater Freedoms with
the Men are more taken Notice of than I am. The Men are such
unthinking Sots, that they do not prefer her who restrains all her
Passions and Affections and keeps much within the Bounds of what is
lawful, to her who goes to the utmost Verge of Innocence, and parlies
at the very Brink of Vice, whether she shall be a Wife or a Mistress.
But I must appeal to your Spectatorial Wisdom, who, I find, have
passed very much of your Time in the Study of Woman, whether this is
not a most unreasonable Proceeding. I have read somewhere, that
_Hobbes_ of _Malmesbury_ asserts, that continent Persons have more of
what they contain, than those who give a loose to their Desires.
According to this Rule, let there be equal Age, equal Wit, and equal
Good-Humour, in the Woman of Prudence, and her of Liberty; what Stores
has he to expect, who takes the former? What Refuse must he be
contented with, who chuses the latter? Well, but I sate down to write
to you to vent my Indignation against several pert Creatures who are
address'd to and courted in this Place, while poor I, and two or three
like me, are wholly unregarded.</p><p>Every one of these affect gaining the Hearts of your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec492.txt')">Sex</a>: This is
generally attempted by a particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec492.txt')">manner</a> of carrying themselves with
Familiarity. _Glycera_ has a dancing Walk, and keeps Time in her
ordinary Gate. _Chloe_, her Sister, who is unwilling to interrupt her
Conquests, comes into the Room before her with a familiar Run.
_Dulcissa_ takes Advantage of the Approach of the Winter, and has
introduc'd a very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec492.txt')">pretty</a> Shiver; closing up her Shoulders, and
shrinking as she moves. All that are in this Mode carry their Fans
between both Hands before them. _Dulcissa_ herself, who is Author of
this Air, adds the pretty Run to it; and has also, when she is in very
good Humour, a taking Familiarity in throwing herself into the lowest
Seat in the Room, and letting her hoop'd Petticoats fall with a lucky
Decency about her. I know she practices this way of sitting down in
her Chamber; and indeed she does it as well as you may have seen an
Actress fall down dead in a Tragedy. Not the least Indecency in her
Posture. If you have observ'd what pretty Carcasses are carry'd off at
the end of a Verse at the Theatre, it will give you a Notion how
_Dulcissa_ plumps into a Chair. Here's a little Country Girl that's
very cunning, that makes her use of being young and unbred, and
outdoes the Insnarers, who are almost twice her Age. The Air that she
takes is to come into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec492.txt')">Company</a> after a Walk, and is very successfully
out of Breath upon occasion. Her Mother is in the Secret, and calls
her Romp, and then looks round to see what young Men stare at her.</p><p>'It would take up more than can come into one of your Papers, to
enumerate all the particular Airs of the younger Company in this
Place. But I cannot omit _Dulceorella_, whose manner is the most
indolent imaginable, but still as watchful of Conquest as the busiest
Virgin among us. She has a peculiar Art of staring at a young Fellow,
till she sees she has got him, and inflam'd him by so much
Observation. When she sees she has him, and he begins to toss his Head
upon it, she is immediately short-sighted, and labours to observe what
he is at a distance with her Eyes half shut. Thus the Captive, that
thought her first struck, is to make very near Approaches, or be
wholly disregarded. This Artifice has done more Execution than all the
ogling of the rest of the Women here, with the utmost Variety of half
Glances, attentive Heedlessnesses, childish Inadvertencies, haughty
Contempts, or artificial Oversights. After I have said thus much of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec492.txt')">Ladies</a> among us who fight thus regularly, I am to complain to you of a
Set of Familiar Romps, who have broken thro' all common Rules, and
have thought of a very effectual way of shewing more Charms than all
of us. These, Mr. SPECTATOR, are the Swingers. You are to know these
careless pretty Creatures are very Innocents again; and it is to be no
matter what they do, for 'tis all harmless Freedom. They get on Ropes,
as you must have seen the Children, and are swung by their Men
Visitants. The Jest is, that Mr. such a one can name the Colour of
Mrs. Such-a-one's Stockings; and she tells him, he is a lying Thief,
so he is, and full of Roguery; and she'll lay a Wager, and her Sister
shall tell the Truth if he says right, and he can't tell what Colour
her Garters are of. In this Diversion there are very many pretty
Shrieks, not so much for fear of falling, as that their Petticoats
shou'd untye: For there is a great care had to avoid Improprieties;
and the Lover who swings the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec492.txt')">Lady</a>, is to tye her Clothes very close
with his Hatband, before she admits him to throw up her Heels.</p><p>'Now, _Mr_. SPECTATOR, except you can note these Wantonnesses in their
Beginnings, and bring us sober Girls into Observation, there is no
help for it, we must swim with the Tide; the Coquets are too powerful
a Party for us. To look into the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec492.txt')">Merit</a> of a regular and well-behav'd
Woman, is a slow thing. A loose trivial Song gains the Affections,
when a wise Homily is not attended to. There is no other way but to
make war upon them, or we must go over to them. As for my Part, I will
shew all the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec492.txt')">World</a> it is not for want of Charms that I stand so long
unasked; and if you do not take measures for the immediate Redress of
us Rigids, as the Fellows <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec492.txt')">call</a> us, I can move with a speaking Mien,
can look significantly, can lisp, can trip, can loll, can start, can
blush, can rage, can weep, if I must do it, and can be frighted as
agreeably as any She in _England_. All which is humbly submitted to
your Spectatorial Consideration with all Humility, by</p><p>_Your most humble Servant_,</p><p>Matilda Mohair.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
