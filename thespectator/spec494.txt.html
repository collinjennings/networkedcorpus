<p>No. 494.             Friday, September 26, 1712.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Ægritudinem laudare, unam rem maximè detestabilem, quorum est tandem
Philosophorum?'</p><p>Cic.</p><p></p><p>About an Age ago it was the fashion in _England_, for every one that
would be thought <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec494.txt')">religious</a>, to throw as much Sanctity as possible into
his Face, and in particular to abstain from all Appearances of <a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec494.txt')">Mirth</a> and
Pleasantry, which were looked upon as the Marks of a Carnal Mind. The
Saint was of a sorrowful <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec494.txt')">Countenance</a>, and generally eaten up with Spleen
and Melancholy. A Gentleman, who was lately a great Ornament to the
Learned World, [1] has diverted me more than once with an Account of the
Reception which he met with from a very famous Independent Minister, who
was Head of a College in those times. [2] This Gentleman was then a
young Adventurer in the Republick of Letters, and just fitted out for
the University with a good Cargo of _Latin_ and _Greek_. His Friends
were resolved that he should try his Fortune at an Election which was
drawing near in the College, of which the Independent Minister whom I
have before mentioned was Governor. The Youth, according to Custom,
waited on him in order to be examined. He was received at the Door by a
Servant, who was one of that gloomy Generation that were then in
fashion. He conducted him, with great Silence and Seriousness, to a long
Gallery which was darkned at Noon-day, and had only a single Candle
burning in it. After a short stay in this melancholy Apartment, he was
led into a Chamber hung with Black, where he entertained himself for
some time by the glimmering of a Taper, till at length the Head of the
College came out to him, from an inner Room, with half a Dozen Night
Caps upon his Head, and a religious Horror in his Countenance. The young
Man trembled; but his Fears encreased when, instead of being ask'd what
Progress he had made in Learning, he was examined how he abounded in
Grace. His _Latin_ and _Greek_ stood him in little stead; he was to give
an account only of the state of his Soul, whether he was of the Number
of the Elect; what was the Occasion of his Conversion; upon what Day of
the Month, and Hour of the Day it happened; how it was carried on, and
when compleated. The whole Examination was summed up with one short
Question, namely, _Whether he was prepared for <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec494.txt')">Death</a>?_ The Boy, who had
been bred up by honest Parents, was frighted out of his Wits at the
Solemnity of the Proceeding, and by the last dreadful Interrogatory; so
that upon making his Escape out of this House of Mourning, he could
never be brought a second time to the Examination, as not being able to
go through the Terrors of it.</p><p>Notwithstanding this general Form and Outside of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec494.txt')">Religion</a> is pretty well
worn out among us, there are many Persons, who, by a natural
Unchearfulness of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec494.txt')">Heart</a>, mistaken Notions of Piety, or Weakness of
Understanding, love to indulge this uncomfortable way of Life, and give
up themselves a Prey to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec494.txt')">Grief</a> and Melancholy. Superstitious Fears and
groundless Scruples cut them off from the Pleasures of <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec494.txt')">Conversation</a>, and
all those social Entertainments, which are not only innocent, but
laudable; as if Mirth was made for Reprobates, and Chearfulness of Heart
denied those who are the only Persons that have a proper Title to it.</p><p>_Sombrius_ is one of these Sons of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec494.txt')">Sorrow</a>. He thinks himself obliged in
Duty to be sad and disconsolate. He looks on a sudden fit of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec494.txt')">Laughter</a> as
a Breach of his Baptismal Vow. An innocent <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec494.txt')">Jest</a> startles him like
Blasphemy. Tell him of one who is advanced to a Title of Honour, he
lifts up his Hands and Eyes; describe a publick Ceremony, he shakes his
Head; shew him a gay Equipage, he blesses himself. All the little
Ornaments of Life are Pomps and Vanities. Mirth is wanton, and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec494.txt')">Wit</a>
profane. He is scandalized at Youth for being lively, and at Childhood
for being playful. He sits at a Christening, or a Marriage Feast, as at
a Funeral; sighs at the Conclusion of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec494.txt')">merry</a> Story, and grows devout
when the rest of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec494.txt')">Company</a> grow <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec494.txt')">pleasant</a>. After all, _Sombrius_ is a
religious Man, and would have behaved himself very properly, had he
lived when Christianity was under a general Persecution.</p><p>I would by no means presume to tax such Characters with Hypocrisy, as is
done too frequently; that being a Vice which I think none but He, who
knows the Secrets of Men's Hearts, should pretend to discover in
another, where the Proofs of it do not amount to a Demonstration. On the
contrary, as there are many excellent Persons, who are weighed down by
this habitual Sorrow of Heart, they rather deserve our Compassion than
our Reproaches. I think, however, they would do well to consider,
whether such a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec494.txt')">Behaviour</a> does not deter Men from a Religious Life, by
representing it as an unsociable State, that extinguishes all Joy and
Gladness, darkens the Face of Nature, and destroys the Relish of Being
it self.</p><p>I have, in former Papers, shewn how great a Tendency there is to
Chearfulness in Religion, and how such a Frame of Mind is not only the
most lovely, but the most commendable in a virtuous Person. In short,
those who represent Religion in so unamiable a Light, are like the Spies
sent by _Moses_ to make a Discovery of the Land of _Promise_, when by
their Reports they discouraged the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec494.txt')">People</a> from entering upon it. Those
who shew us the Joy, the Chearfulness, the Good-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec494.txt')">humour</a>, that naturally
spring up in this happy State, are like the Spies bringing along with
them the Clusters of Grapes, and delicious Fruits, that might invite
their Companions into the pleasant Country which produced them.</p><p>An eminent Pagan Writer [3] has made a Discourse, to shew that the
Atheist, who denies a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec494.txt')">God</a>, does him less Dishonour than the Man who owns
his Being, but at the same time believes him to be cruel, hard to
please, and terrible to Human Nature. For my own part, says he, I would
rather it should be said of me, that there was never any such Man as
_Plutarch_, than that _Plutarch_ was ill-natured, capricious, or inhuman.</p><p>If we may believe our Logicians, Man is distinguished from all other
Creatures by the Faculty of Laughter. He has an Heart capable of Mirth,
and naturally disposed to it. It is not the Business of Virtue to
extirpate the Affections of the Mind, but to regulate them. It may
moderate and restrain, but was not designed to banish Gladness from the
Heart of Man. Religion contracts the Circle of our Pleasures, but leaves
it wide enough for her Votaries to expatiate in. The Contemplation of
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec494.txt')">Divine</a> Being, and the Exercise of Virtue, are in their own Nature so
far from excluding all Gladness of Heart, that they are perpetual
Sources of it. In a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec494.txt')">word</a>, the true Spirit of Religion cheers, as well as
composes the Soul; it banishes indeed all Levity of Behaviour, all
vicious and dissolute Mirth, but in exchange fills the Mind with a
perpetual Serenity, uninterrupted Chearfulness, and an habitual
Inclination to please others, as well as to be pleased in it self.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Supposed to be Anthony Henley, a gentleman of property, who

prayed with and for him in his last illness. At the Restoration, Dr.
Goodwin was deprived of his post at Oxford, and he then preached in
London to an Assembly of Independents till his death, in 1679. His works
were collected in five volumes folio.]</p><p>
