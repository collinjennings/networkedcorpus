<p>No. 495.           Saturday, September 27, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus
Nigr√¶ feraci frondis in Algido,
Per damna, per cades, ab ipso
Ducit opes animumque ferro.</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>As I am one, who, by my Profession, am obliged to look into all kinds of
Men, there are none whom I consider with so much Pleasure, as those who
have any thing new or extraordinary in their Characters, or Ways of
living. For this reason I have often amused my self with Speculations on
the Race of <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec495.txt')">People</a> called _Jews_, many of whom I have met with in most
of the considerable Towns which I have passed through in the Course of
my Travels. They are, indeed, so disseminated through all the trading
parts of the World, that they are become the Instruments by which the
most distant Nations converse with one another, and by which Mankind are
knit together in a general Correspondence: They are like the Pegs and
Nails in a great Building, which, though they are but little valued in
themselves, are absolutely necessary to keep the whole Frame together.</p><p>That I may not fall into any common beaten Tracks of Observation, I
shall consider this People in three Views: First, with regard to their
Number; Secondly, their Dispersion; and, Thirdly, their Adherence to
their <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec495.txt')">Religion</a>: and afterwards endeavour to shew, First, what Natural
Reasons, and, Secondly, what Providential Reasons may be assigned for
these three remarkable Particulars.</p><p>The _Jews_ are looked upon by many to be as numerous at present, as they
were formerly in the Land of _Canaan_.</p><p>This is wonderful, considering the dreadful Slaughter made of them under
some of the _Roman_ Emperors, which Historians describe by the Death of
many <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec495.txt')">Hundred</a> Thousands in a <a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec495.txt')">War</a>; and the innumerable Massacres and
Persecutions they have undergone in _Turkey_, as well as in all
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec495.txt')">Christian</a> Nations of the World. The _Rabbins_, to express the great
Havock which has been sometimes made of them, tell us, after their usual
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec495.txt')">manner</a> of Hyperbole, that there were such Torrents of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec495.txt')">Holy</a> Blood shed as
carried Rocks of an hundred Yards in Circumference above three Miles
into the Sea.</p><p>Their Dispersion is the second remarkable Particular in this People.
They swarm over all the _East_; and are settled in the remotest Parts of
_China_: They are spread through most of the Nations of _Europe_ and
_Africk_, and many Families of them are established in the
_West-Indies_: not to mention whole Nations bordering on
_Prester-John's_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec495.txt')">Country</a>, and some discovered in the inner Parts of
_America_, if we may give any Credit to their own Writers.</p><p>Their firm Adherence to their Religion, is no less remarkable than their
Numbers and Dispersion, especially considering it as persecuted or
contemned over the Face of the whole Earth. This is likewise the more
remarkable, if we consider the frequent Apostacies of this People, when
they lived under their Kings, in the Land of _Promise_, and within sight
of their Temple.</p><p>If in the next place we examine, what may be the Natural Reasons for
these three Particulars which we find in the _Jews_, and which are not
to be found in any other Religion or People, I can, in the first place,
attribute their Numbers to nothing but their constant Employment, their
Abstinence, their Exemption from Wars, and above all, their frequent
Marriages; for they look on Celibacy as an accursed State, and generally
are married before Twenty, as hoping the _Messiah_ may descend from them.</p><p>The Dispersion of the _Jews_ into all the Nations of the Earth, is the
second remarkable Particular of that People, though not so hard to be
accounted for. They were always in Rebellions and Tumults while they had
the Temple and Holy City in View, for which reason they have often been
driven out of their old Habitations in the Land of _Promise_. They have
as often been banished out of most other Places where they have settled,
which must very much disperse and scatter a People, and oblige them to
seek a Livelihood where they can find it. Besides, the whole People is
now a Race of such Merchants as are Wanderers by Profession, and at the
same time, are in most if not all Places incapable of either Lands or
Offices, that might engage them to make any Part of the World their
Home.</p><p>This Dispersion would probably have lost their Religion, had it not been
secured by the Strength of its Constitution: For they are to live all in
a Body, and generally within the same Enclosure; to marry among
themselves, and to eat no Meats that are not killed or prepared their
own way. This shuts them out from all Table <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec495.txt')">Conversation</a>, and the most
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec495.txt')">agreeable</a> Intercourses of Life; and, by consequence, excludes them from
the most probable Means of Conversion.</p><p>If, in the last place, we consider what Providential Reason may be
assigned for these three Particulars, we shall find that their Numbers,
Dispersion, and Adherence to their Religion, have furnished every Age,
and every Nation of the World, with the strongest Arguments for the
Christian <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec495.txt')">Faith</a>, not only as these very Particulars are foretold of
them, but as they themselves are the Depositaries of these and all the
other Prophecies, which tend to their own Confusion. Their Number
furnishes us with a sufficient Cloud of Witnesses that attest the Truth
of the Old Bible. Their Dispersion spreads these Witnesses thro' all
parts of the World. The Adherence to their Religion makes their
Testimony unquestionable. Had the whole Body of the _Jews_ been
converted to Christianity, we should certainly have thought all the
Prophecies of the old Testament, that relate to the Coming and History
of our Blessed Saviour, forged by Christians, and have looked upon them,
with the Prophecies of the _Sybils_, as made many Years after the Events
they pretended to foretell.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
