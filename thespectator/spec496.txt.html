<p>No. 496.              Monday, September 29, 1712.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Gnatum pariter uti his decuit aut etiam amplius,
Quod illa ætas magis ad hæc utenda idonea est.'</p><p>Terent. Heaut. A. 1. Sc. 1.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Those Ancients who were the most accurate in their Remarks on the
Genius and Temper of Mankind, by considering the various Bent and
Scope of our Actions throughout the Progress of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec496.txt')">Life</a>, have with <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec496.txt')">great</a>
Exactness allotted Inclinations and Objects of Desire particular to
every Stage, according to the different Circumstances of our
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec496.txt')">Conversation</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec496.txt')">Fortune</a>, thro' the several Periods of it. Hence they
were disposed easily to excuse those Excesses which might possibly
arise from a too eager Pursuit of the Affections more immediately
proper to each State: They indulged the Levity of Childhood with
Tenderness, overlooked the Gayety of Youth with Good-nature, tempered
the forward <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec496.txt')">Ambition</a> and Impatience of ripen'd Manhood with
Discretion, and kindly imputed the tenacious Avarice of old Men to
their want of relish for any other Enjoyment. Such Allowances as these
were no less advantageous to common Society than obliging to
particular Persons; for by maintaining a Decency and Regularity in the
Course of Life, they supported the Dignity of human Nature, which then
suffers the greatest Violence when the Order of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec496.txt')">things</a> is inverted;
and in nothing is it more remarkably vilify'd and ridiculous, than
when Feebleness preposterously attempts to adorn it self with that
outward Pomp and Lustre, which serve only to set off the Bloom of
Youth with better advantage. I was insensibly carried into Reflections
of this nature, by just now meeting _Paulino_ (who is in his
Climacterick) bedeck'd with the utmost Splendour of Dress and
Equipage, and giving an unbounded Loose to all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec496.txt')">manner</a> of Pleasure,
whilst his only <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec496.txt')">Son</a> is debarr'd all innocent Diversion, and may be
seen frequently solacing himself in the _Mall_ with no other
Attendance than one antiquated Servant of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec496.txt')">Father</a>'s for a Companion
and Director.</p><p>'It is a monstrous want of Reflection, that a Man cannot consider,
that when he cannot resign the Pleasures of Life in his Decay of
Appetite and Inclination to them, his Son must have a much uneasier
Task to resist the Impetuosity of growing Desires. The Skill therefore
should, methinks, be to let a Son want no lawful Diversion, in
proportion to his future Fortune, and the Figure he is to make in the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec496.txt')">World</a>. The first Step towards Virtue that I have observed in young Men
of Condition that have run into Excesses, has been that they had a
regard to their Quality and Reputation in the Management of their
Vices. Narrowness in their Circumstances has made many Youths, to
supply themselves as Debauchees, commence Cheats and Rascals. The
Father who allows his Son to his utmost ability avoids this latter
Evil, which as to the World is much greater than the former. But the
contrary Practice has prevail'd so much among some Men, that I have
known them deny them what was merely necessary for Education suitable
to their Quality. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec496.txt')">Poor</a> young _Antonio_ is a lamentable Instance of ill
Conduct in this kind. The young Man did not want natural Talents; but
the Father of him was a Coxcomb, who affected being a fine Gentleman
so unmercifully, that he could not endure in his sight, or the
frequent mention of one, who was his Son, growing into Manhood, and
thrusting him out of the gay World. I have often thought the Father
took a secret Pleasure in reflecting that when that fine House and
Seat came into the next hands, it would revive his Memory, as a Person
who knew how to enjoy them, from Observation of the Rusticity and
Ignorance of his Successor. Certain it is that a Man may, if he will,
let his Heart close to the having no regard to any thing but his dear
self, even with exclusion of his very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec496.txt')">Children</a>. I recommend this
Subject to your Consideration, and am,</p><p>_SIR, Your most humble Servant_,</p><p>T. B.</p><p></p><p>_London, Sept._ 26, 1712.</p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I am just come from _Tunbridge_, and have since my return read Mrs.
_Matilda Mohair's_ Letter to you: She pretends to make a mighty Story
about the Diversion of Swinging in that Place. What was done, was only
among Relations; and no Man swung any Woman who was not second Cousin
at farthest. She is pleased to say, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec496.txt')">care</a> was taken that the Gallants
tied the Ladies Legs before they were wafted into the Air. Since she
is so spiteful, I'll tell you the plain Truth; there was no such
Nicety observed, since we were all, as I just now told you, near
Relations; but Mrs. _Mohair_ her self has been swung there, and she
invents all this Malice, because it was observed she has crooked Legs,
of which I was an Eye-Witness.</p><p>_Your humble Servant_,</p><p>Rachel Shoestring.</p><p></p><p>_Tunbridge, Sept._ 26, 1712.</p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'We have just now read your Paper, containing Mrs. _Mohair's_ Letter.
It is an Invention of her own from one end to the other; and I desire
you would print the enclosed Letter by it self, and shorten it so as
to come within the Compass of your Half-Sheet. She is the most
malicious Minx in the World, for all she looks so innocent. Don't
leave out that Part about her being in love with her Father's Butler,
which makes her shun Men; for that is the truest of it all.</p><p>_Your humble Servant_,</p><p>Sarah Trice.</p><p>P.S. 'She has crooked Legs.'</p><p></p><p>_Tunbridge, Sept._ 26, 1712.</p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'All that Mrs. _Mohair_ is so vexed at against the good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec496.txt')">Company</a> of
this Place, is, that we all know she has crooked Legs. This is
certainly true. I don't care for putting my Name, because one would
not be in the Power of the Creature.</p><p>_Your humble Servant unknown_.</p><p></p><p>_Tunbridge, Sept._ 26, 1712.</p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'That insufferable Prude Mrs. _Mohair_, who has told such Stories of
the Company here, is with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec496.txt')">Child</a>, for all her nice Airs and her crooked
Legs. Pray be sure to put her in for both those two Things, and you'll
oblige every Body here, especially</p><p>_Your humble Servant_,</p><p>Alice Bluegarter.'</p><p>
