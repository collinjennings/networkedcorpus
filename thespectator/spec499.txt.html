<p>No. 499.              Thursday, October 2, 1712.                Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Nimis uncis
Naribus indulges--'</p><p>Pers.</p><p></p><p>My <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec499.txt')">Friend</a> WILL. HONEYCOMB has told me, for above this half Year, that he
had a great mind to try his Hand at a _Spectator_, and that he would
fain have one of his writing in my Works. This Morning I received from
him the following Letter, which, after having rectified some little
Orthographical Mistakes, I shall make a Present of to the Publick.</p><p>
_<a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec499.txt')">Dear</a>_ SPEC.</p><p>'I was, about two Nights ago, in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec499.txt')">Company</a> with very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec499.txt')">agreeable</a> <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec499.txt')">young</a>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec499.txt')">People</a> of both Sexes, where talking of some of your Papers which are
written on Conjugal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec499.txt')">Love</a>, there arose a Dispute among us, whether
there were not more bad <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec499.txt')">Husbands</a> in the World than bad Wives. A
Gentleman, who was Advocate for the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec499.txt')">Ladies</a>, took this occasion to tell
us the story of a famous Siege in _Germany_, which I have since found
related in my Historical Dictionary, after the following <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec499.txt')">manner</a>. When
the Emperor _Conrade_ the Third had besieged _Guelphus_, Duke of
_Bavaria_, in the City of _Hensberg_, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec499.txt')">Women</a> finding that the Town
could not possibly hold out long, petitioned the Emperor that they
might depart out of it, with so much as each of them could carry. The
Emperor knowing they could not convey away many of their Effects,
granted them their Petition; When the Women, to his great Surprize,
came out of the Place with every one her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec499.txt')">Husband</a> upon her back. The
Emperor was so moved at the sight, that he burst into Tears, and after
having very much extolled the Women for their conjugal Affection, gave
the Men to their Wives, and received the Duke into his Favour.</p><p>'The Ladies did not a little triumph at this Story, asking us at the
same time, whether in our Consciences we believed that the Men of any
Town in _Great Britain_ would, upon the same Offer, and at the same
Conjuncture, have loaden themselves with their Wives; or rather,
whether they would not have been glad of such an opportunity to get
rid of them? To this my very good Friend _Tom Dapperwit_, who took
upon him to be the Mouth of our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec499.txt')">Sex</a>, replied, that they would be very
much to blame if they would not do the same good Office for the Women,
considering that their Strength would be greater, and their Burdens
lighter. As we were amusing our selves with Discourses of this nature,
in order to pass away the Evening, which now begins to grow tedious,
we fell into that laudable and primitive Diversion of Questions and
Commands. I was no sooner vested with the regal Authority, but I
enjoined all the Ladies, under pain of my Displeasure, to tell the
Company ingenuously, in case they had been in the Siege
abovementioned, and had the same Offers made them as the good Women of
that Place, what every one of them would have brought off with her,
and have thought most worth the saving? There were several merry
Answers made to my Question, which entertained us till Bed-time. This
filled my Mind with such a huddle of Ideas, that upon my going to
sleep, I fell into the following Dream.</p><p>'I saw a Town of this Island, which shall be nameless, invested on
every side, and the Inhabitants of it so straitned as to cry for
Quarter. The General refused any other Terms than those granted to the
abovementioned Town of _Hensberg_, namely, that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec499.txt')">married</a> Women
might come out with what they could bring along with them. Immediately
the City-Gates flew open, and a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec499.txt')">Female</a> Procession appeared. Multitudes
of the Sex following one another in a row, and staggering under their
respective Burdens. I took my Stand upon an Eminence in the Enemies
Camp, which was appointed for the general Rendezvous of these Female
Carriers, being very desirous to look into their several Ladings. The
first of them had a huge Sack upon her Shoulders, which she set down
with great Care: Upon the opening of it, when I expected to have seen
her Husband shot out of it, I found it was filled with China-Ware. The
next appeared in a more decent Figure, carrying a handsome young
Fellow upon her Back: I could not forbear commending the young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec499.txt')">Woman</a>
for her Conjugal Affection, when to my great Surprize, I found that
she had left the good Man at home, and brought away her Gallant. I saw
the third, at some distance, with a little withered Face peeping over
her Shoulder, whom I could not suspect for any but her Spouse, till
upon her setting him down I heard her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec499.txt')">call</a> him dear Pugg, and found
him to be her Favourite Monkey. A fourth brought a huge Bale of Cards
along with her; and the fifth a _Bolonia_ Lap-Dog; for her Husband, it
seems, being a very Burly Man, she thought it would be less trouble
for her to bring away little _Cupid_. The next was the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec499.txt')">Wife</a> of a rich
Usurer, loaden with a Bag of Gold; she told us that her Spouse was
very old, and by the course of Nature could not expect to live long;
and that to shew her tender regards for him, she had saved that which
the poor Man loved better than his Life. The next came towards us with
her Son upon her Back, who, we were told, was the greatest Rake in the
Place, but so much the Mother's Darling, that she left her Husband
behind with a large Family of hopeful Sons and Daughters, for the sake
of this Graceless Youth.</p><p>'It would be endless to mention the several Persons, with their
several Loads that appeared to me in this strange Vision. All the
Place about me was covered with packs of Ribbands, Brocades,
Embroidery, and Ten thousand other Materials, sufficient to have
furnished a whole Street of Toy-shops. One of the Women, having an
Husband who was none of the heaviest, was bringing him off upon her
Shoulders, at the same time that she carried a great bundle of
_Flanders-lace_ under her Arm; but finding herself so overloaden, that
she could not save both of them, she dropp'd the good Man, and brought
away the Bundle. In short, I found but one Husband among this great
Mountain of Baggage, who was a lively Cobler, that kick'd and spurr'd
all the while his Wife was carrying him on, and, as it was said, had
scarce passed a Day in his Life without giving her the Discipline of
the Strap.</p><p>'I cannot conclude my Letter, Dear SPEC., without telling thee one
very odd Whim in this my Dream, I saw, methoughts, a dozen Women
employed in bringing off one Man; I could not guess who it should be,
till upon his nearer approach I discover'd thy short Phiz. The Women
all declared that it was for the sake of thy Works, and not thy
Person, that they brought thee off, and that it was on condition that
thou should'st continue the _Spectator_. If thou thinkest this Dream
will make a tolerable one, it is at thy Service, from,</p><p>'_Dear_ SPEC.</p><p>'_Thine, Sleeping and Waking_,</p><p>'WILL. HONEYCOMB.'</p><p>The Ladies will see, by this Letter, what I have often told them, that
WILL. is one of those old-fashioned Men of Wit and Pleasure of the Town,
that shews his Parts by Raillery on <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec499.txt')">Marriage</a>, and one who has often
tried his Fortune that way without Success. I cannot however dismiss his
Letter, without observing, that the true Story on which it is built does
Honour to the Sex, and that in order to abuse them, the Writer is
obliged to have recourse to Dream and Fiction. [1]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: At the end of this number and in all following numbers
