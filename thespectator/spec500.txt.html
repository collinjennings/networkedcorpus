<p>No. 500.               Friday, October 3, 1712.                 Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Huc natas adjice septem,
Et totidem juvenes, et mox generosque nurusque.
Qu√¶rite nunc, habeat quam nostra superbia causam.'</p><p>Ov. Met.</p><p></p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>'You who are so well acquainted with the Story of _Socrates_, must
have read how, upon his making a Discourse concerning <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec500.txt')">Love</a>, he pressed
his Point with so much Success, that all the Batchelors in his
Audience took a Resolution to Marry by the first Opportunity, and that
all the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec500.txt')">married</a> Men immediately took Horse and galloped home to their
Wives. I am apt to think your Discourses, in which you have drawn so
many <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec500.txt')">agreeable</a> Pictures of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec500.txt')">Marriage</a>, have had a very good Effect this
way in _<a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec500.txt')">England</a>_. We are obliged to you, at least for having taken off
that Senseless Ridicule, which for many Years the Witlings of the Town
have turned upon their Fathers and Mothers. For my own part, I was
born in Wedlock, and I don't <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec500.txt')">care</a> who knows it; For which Reason,
among many others, I should look upon my self as a most insufferable
Coxcomb, did I endeavour to maintain that Cuckoldom was inseparable
from Marriage, or to make use of _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec500.txt')">Husband</a>_ and _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec500.txt')">Wife</a>_ as Terms of
Reproach. Nay, Sir, I will go one step further, and declare to you
before the whole World, that I am a married Man, and at the same time
I have so much Assurance as not to be ashamed of what I have done.</p><p>'Among the several Pleasures that accompany this state of Life, and
which you have described in your former Papers, there are two you have
not taken Notice of, and which are seldom cast into the Account, by
those who write on this Subject. You must have observed, in your
Speculations on Human Nature, that nothing is more gratifying to the
Mind of Man than Power or Dominion; and this I think my self amply
possessed of, as I am the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec500.txt')">Father</a> of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec500.txt')">Family</a>. I am perpetually taken
up in giving out Orders, in prescribing Duties, in hearing Parties, in
administring Justice, and in distributing Rewards and Punishments. To
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec500.txt')">speak</a> in the Language of the Centurion, _I say unto one, Go, and he
goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my Servant, Do
This, and he doth it_. In short, Sir, I look upon my Family as a
Patriarchal Sovereignty, in which I am my self both <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec500.txt')">King</a> and Priest.
All great Governments are nothing else but Clusters of these little
private Royalties, and therefore I consider the Masters of Families as
small Deputy-Governors presiding over the several little Parcels and
Divisions of their Fellow <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec500.txt')">Subjects</a>. As I take great pleasure in the
Administration of my Government in particular, so I look upon my self
not only as a more useful, but as a much greater and happier Man than
any Batchelor in _England_ of [my [1]] Rank and Condition.</p><p>'There is another accidental Advantage in Marriage, which has likewise
fallen to my share, I mean the having a Multitude of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec500.txt')">Children</a>. These I
cannot but regard as very great Blessings. When I see my little Troop
before me, I rejoice in the Additions which I have made to my Species,
to my Country, and to my Religion, in having produced such a Number of
reasonable Creatures, Citizens, and Christians. I am pleased to see my
self thus perpetuated; and as there is no Production comparable to
that of a human Creature, I am more proud of having been the Occasion
of ten such glorious Productions, than if I had built a hundred
Pyramids at my own Expence, or published as many Volumes of the finest
Wit and Learning. In what a beautiful Light has the Holy Scripture
represented _Abdon_, one of the Judges of _Israel_, who had forty Sons
and thirty Grandsons, that rode on Threescore and Ten Ass-Colts,
according to the Magnificence of the Eastern Countries? How must the
Heart of the old Man rejoice, when he saw such a beautiful Procession
of his own Descendants, such a numerous Cavalcade of his own raising?
For my own part, I can sit in my Parlour with great content, when I
take a review of half a dozen of my little Boys mounting upon
Hobby-Horses, and of as many little Girls tutoring their Babies, each
of them endeavouring to excel the rest, and to do something that may
gain my Favour and Approbation. I cannot question but he who has
blessed me with so many Children, will assist my Endeavours in
providing for them. There is one thing I am able to give each of them,
which is a virtuous Education. I think it is Sir _Francis Bacon's_
Observation, that in a numerous Family of Children the eldest is often
spoiled by the Prospect of an Estate, and the youngest by being the
Darling of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec500.txt')">Parent</a>; but that some one or other in the middle, who
has not perhaps been regarded, has made his way in the World, and
over-topped the rest. It is my Business to implant in every one of my
Children the same Seeds of Industry, and the same honest Principles.
By this Means I think I have a fair Chance, that one or other of them
may grow considerable in some or other way of Life, whether it be in
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec500.txt')">Army</a>, or in the Fleet, in Trade, or any of the three learned
Professions; for you must know, Sir, that from long Experience and
Observation, I am persuaded of what seems a Paradox to most of those
with whom I converse, namely, That a Man who has many Children, and
gives them a good Education, is more likely to raise a Family, than he
who has but one, notwithstanding he leaves him his whole Estate. For
this reason I cannot forbear amusing my self with finding out a
General, an Admiral, or an Alderman of _London_, a Divine, a
Physician, or a Lawyer, among my little <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec500.txt')">People</a> who are now perhaps in
Petticoats; and when I see the Motherly Airs of my little Daughters
when they are playing with their Puppets, I cannot but flatter my self
that their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec500.txt')">Husbands</a> and Children will be happy in the Possession of
such Wives and Mothers.</p><p>'If you are a Father, you will not perhaps think this Letter
impertinent: but if you are a single Man, you will not know the
Meaning of it, and probably throw it into the Fire: Whatever you
determine of it, you may assure yourself that it comes from one who is</p><p>'_Your most humble Servant, and Well-wisher_,</p><p>'Philogamus.'</p><p>
