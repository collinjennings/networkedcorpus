<p>No. 503.                 Tuesday, October 7, 1712.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Deleo omnes dehinc ex animo Mulieres.'</p><p>Ter.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'You have often mention'd with <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec503.txt')">great</a> Vehemence and Indignation the
Misbehaviour of <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec503.txt')">People</a> at <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec503.txt')">Church</a>; but I am at present to talk to you
on that Subject, and complain to you of one, whom at the same time I
know not what to accuse of, except it be looking too well there, and
diverting the Eyes of the Congregation to that one Object. However I
have this to say, that she might have stay'd at her own Parish, and
not come to perplex those who are otherwise intent upon their Duty.</p><p>'Last _Sunday_ was Seven-night I went into a Church not far from
_London_-Bridge; but I wish I had been contented to go to my own
Parish, I am sure it had been better for me: I say, I went to Church
thither, and got into a Pew very near the Pulpit. I had hardly been
accommodated with a Seat, before there entered into the Isle a <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec503.txt')">young</a>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec503.txt')">Lady</a> in the very Bloom of Youth and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec503.txt')">Beauty</a>, and dressed in the most
elegant <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec503.txt')">manner</a> imaginable. Her Form was such, that it engaged the Eyes
of the whole Congregation in an Instant, and mine among the rest. Tho'
we were all thus fixed upon her, she was not in the least out of
Countenance, or under the least Disorder, tho' unattended by any one,
and not seeming to know particularly where to place her self. However,
she had not in the least a confident Aspect, but moved on with the
most graceful Modesty, every one making Way till she came to a Seat
just over-against that in which I was placed. The Deputy of the Ward
sat in that Pew, and she stood opposite to him; and at a Glance into
the Seat, tho' she did not appear the least acquainted with the
Gentleman, was let in, with a Confusion that spoke much Admiration at
the Novelty of the Thing. The Service immediately began, and she
compos'd her self for it with an Air of so much Goodness and
Sweetness, that the Confession which she uttered so as to be heard
where I sat, appeared an Act of Humiliation more than she had Occasion
for. The Truth is, her Beauty had something so innocent, and yet so
sublime, that we all gazed upon her like a Phantom. None of the
Pictures which we behold of the best _Italian_ Painters, have any
thing like the Spirit which appeared in her Countenance, at the
different Sentiments expressed in the several Parts of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec503.txt')">Divine</a> Service:
That Gratitude and Joy at a Thanksgiving, that Lowliness and Sorrow at
the Prayers for the Sick and Distressed, that Triumph at the Passages
which gave Instances of divine Mercy, which appeared respectively in
her Aspect, will be in my Memory to my last Hour. I protest to you,
Sir, she suspended the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec503.txt')">Devotion</a> of every one around her; and the Ease
she did every thing with, soon dispersed the churlish Dislike and
Hesitation in approving what is excellent, too frequent amongst us, to
a general Attention and Entertainment in observing her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec503.txt')">Behaviour</a>. All
the while that we were gazing at her, she took Notice of no Object
about her, but had an Art of seeming awkwardly attentive, whatever
else her Eyes were accidentally thrown upon. One Thing indeed was
particular, she stood the whole Service, and never kneeled or sat; I
do not question but that was to shew her self with the greater
Advantage, and set forth to better Grace her Hands and Arms, lifted up
with the most ardent Devotion, and her Bosom, the fairest Observation;
while she, you must think, knew nothing of the Concern she gave
others, any other than as an Example of Devotion, that threw her self
out, without regard to Dress or Garment, all Contrition, and loose of
all Worldly Regards, in Ecstasy of Devotion. Well, now the Organ was
to play a Voluntary, and she was so skilful in Musick, and so touched
with it, that she kept time not only with some Motion of her Head, but
also with a different Air in her Countenance. When the Musick was
strong and bold, she look'd exalted, but serious; when lively and
airy, she was smiling and gracious; when the Notes were more soft and
languishing, she was kind and full of Pity. When she had now made it
visible to the whole Congregation, by her Motion and Ear, that she
could dance, and she wanted now only to inform us that she could sing
too, when the Psalm was given out, her Voice was distinguished above
all the rest, or rather People did not exert their own in order to
hear her. Never was any heard so sweet and so strong. The Organist
observed it, and he thought fit to play to her only, and she swelled
every Note; when she found she had thrown us all out, and had the last
Verse to herself in such a manner as the whole Congregation was intent
upon her, in the same manner as we see in the Cathedrals, they are on
the Person who sings alone the Anthem. Well, it came at last to the
Sermon, and our young Lady would not lose her Part in that neither;
for she fixed her Eye upon the Preacher, and as he said any thing she
approved, with one of _Charles Mathers's_ fine Tablets she set down
the Sentence, at once shewing her fine Hand, the Gold-Pen, her
Readiness in Writing, and her Judgment in chusing what to write. To
sum up what I intend by this long and particular Account, I mean to
appeal to you, whether it is reasonable that such a Creature as this
shall come from a jaunty Part of the Town, and give herself such
violent Airs, to the disturbance of an innocent and inoffensive
Congregation, with her Sublimities. The Fact, I assure you, was as I
have related; but I had like to have forgot another very considerable
Particular. As soon as Church was done, she immediately stepp'd out of
her Pew, and fell into the finest pitty-pat Air, forsooth, wonderfully
out of Countenance, tossing her Head up and down as she swam along the
Body of the Church. I, with several others of the Inhabitants,
follow'd her out, and saw her hold up her Fan to an Hackney-Coach at a
Distance, who immediately came up to her, and she whipp'd into it with
great Nimbleness, pull'd the Door with a bowing Mein, as if she had
been used to a better Glass. She said aloud, _You know where to go_,
and drove off. By this time the best of the Congregation was at the
Church-Door, and I could hear some say, _A very fine Lady_; others,
_I'll warrant ye, she's no better than she should be_; and one very
wise old Lady said, _She ought to have been taken up_. Mr. SPECTATOR,
I think this Matter lies wholly before you: for the Offence does not
come under any Law, tho' it is apparent this Creature came among us
only to give herself Airs, and enjoy her full Swing in being admir'd.
I desire you would print this, that she may be confin'd to her own
Parish; for I can assure you there is no attending any thing else in a
Place where she is a Novelty. She has been talked of among us ever
since under the Name of the _Phantom_: But I would advise her to come
no more; for there is so strong a Party made by the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec503.txt')">Women</a> against her,
that she must expect they will not be excell'd a second time in so
outrageous a manner, without doing her some Insult. Young Women, who
assume after this rate, and affect exposing themselves to view in
Congregations at t'other end of the Town, are not so mischievous,
because they are rivall'd by more of the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec503.txt')">Ambition</a>, who will not
let the rest of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec503.txt')">Company</a> be particular: But in the Name of the
whole Congregation where I was, I desire you to keep these <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec503.txt')">agreeable</a>
Disturbances out of the City, where Sobriety of Manners is still
preserv'd, and all glaring and ostentatious Behaviour, even in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec503.txt')">things</a>
laudable, discountenanced. I wish you may never see the Phantom, and
am,'</p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>_Your most humble Servant_,</p><p>Ralph Wonder.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
