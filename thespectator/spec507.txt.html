<p>No. 507.                Saturday, October 11, 1712.             Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Defendit numerus, junctæque umbone Phalanges.'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>There is something very Sublime, tho' very fanciful, in _Plato's_
Description of the Supreme Being, That _Truth is his <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec507.txt')">Body</a>, and Light his
Shadow_. According to this Definition, there is nothing so contradictory
to his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec507.txt')">Nature</a>, as Error and Falshood. The Platonists have so just a
Notion of the Almighty's Aversion to every thing which is false and
erroneous, that they looked upon _Truth_ as no less necessary than
_<a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec507.txt')">Virtue</a>_, to qualifie an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec507.txt')">human</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec507.txt')">Soul</a> for the Enjoyment of a separate
State. For this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec507.txt')">reason</a> as they recommended Moral Duties to qualifie and
season the Will for a future Life, so they prescribed several
Contemplations and Sciences to rectifie the Understanding. Thus _Plato_
has called Mathematical Demonstrations the Catharticks or Purgatives of
the Soul, as being the most proper Means to cleanse it from Error, and
to give it a Relish of Truth; which is the natural Food and Nourishment
of the Understanding, as Virtue is the Perfection and Happiness of the
Will.</p><p>There are many Authors who have shewn wherein the Malignity of a _Lie_
consists, and set forth in proper Colours, the Heinousness of the
Offence. I shall here consider one Particular Kind of this Crime, which
has not been so much spoken to; I mean that abominable Practice of
_<a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec507.txt')">Party</a>-lying_. This <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec507.txt')">Vice</a> is so very predominant among us at present,
that a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec507.txt')">Man</a> is thought of no Principles, who does not propagate a certain
System of Lies. The Coffee-Houses are supported by them, the Press is
choaked with them, eminent Authors live upon them. Our
Bottle-<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec507.txt')">Conversation</a> is so infected with them, that a Party-Lie is grown
as fashionable an Entertainment, as a lively Catch or a merry Story: The
Truth of it is, half the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec507.txt')">great</a> Talkers in the Nation would be struck
dumb, were this Fountain of Discourse dried up. There is however one
Advantage resulting from this detestable Practice; the very Appearances
of Truth are so little regarded, that Lies are at present discharg'd in
the Air, and begin to hurt no Body. When we hear a Party-story from a
Stranger, we consider whether he is a Whig or a Tory that relates it,
and immediately conclude they are <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec507.txt')">Words</a> of course, in which the honest
Gentleman designs to recommend his Zeal, without any Concern for his
Veracity. A Man is looked upon as bereft of common Sense, that gives
Credit to the Relations of Party-Writers; [nay] his own Friends shake
their Heads at him, and consider him in no other Light than as an
officious Tool or a well-meaning Ideot. When it was formerly the Fashion
to husband a Lie, and trump it up in some extraordinary Emergency, it
generally did Execution, and was not a little serviceable to the Faction
that made use of it; but at present every Man is upon his Guard, the
Artifice has been too often repeated to take Effect.</p><p>I have frequently wonder'd to see Men of Probity, who would scorn to
utter a Falshood for their own particular Advantage, give so readily
into a Lie when it becomes the Voice of their Faction, notwithstanding
they are thoroughly sensible of it as such. How is it possible for those
who are Men of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec507.txt')">Honour</a> in their Persons, thus to become notorious Liars
in their Party? If we look into the Bottom of this Matter, we may find,
I think, three Reasons for it, and at the same time discover the
Insufficiency of these Reasons to justify so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec507.txt')">Criminal</a> a Practice.</p><p>In the first place, Men are apt to think that the Guilt of a Lie, and
consequently the Punishment, may be very much diminish'd, if not wholly
worn out, by the Multitudes of those who partake in it. Tho' the Weight
of a Falshood would be too heavy for _one_ to bear, it grows light in
their Imaginations, when it is shared among _many_. But in this Case a
Man very much deceives himself; Guilt, when it spreads thro' numbers, is
not so properly divided as multiplied: Every one is criminal in
proportion to the Offence which he commits, not to the Number of those
who are his Companions in it. Both the Crime and the Penalty lie as
heavy upon every Individual of an offending Multitude, as they would
upon any single Person had none shared with him in the Offence. In a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec507.txt')">word</a>, the Division of Guilt is like that of Matter; tho' it may be
separated into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec507.txt')">infinite</a> Portions, every Portion shall have the whole
Essence of Matter in it, and consist of as many Parts as the Whole did
before it was divided.</p><p>But in the second place, tho' Multitudes, who join in a Lie, cannot
exempt themselves from the Guilt, they may from the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec507.txt')">Shame</a> of it. The
Scandal of a Lie is in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec507.txt')">manner</a> lost and annihilated, when diffused
among several Thousands; as a Drop of the blackest Tincture wears away
and vanishes, when mixed and confused in a considerable Body of Water;
the Blot is still in it, but is not able to discover it self. This is
certainly a very great Motive to several Party-Offenders, who avoid
Crimes, not as they are prejudicial to their Virtue, but to their
Reputation. It is enough to shew the Weakness of this Reason, which
palliates Guilt without removing it, that every Man who is influenced by
it declares himself in effect an infamous Hypocrite, prefers the
Appearance of Virtue to its Reality, and is determined in his Conduct
neither by the Dictates of his own Conscience, the Suggestions of true
Honour, nor the Principles of Religion.</p><p>The third and last great Motive for Mens joining in a popular Falshood,
or, as I have hitherto called it, a Party-Lie, notwithstanding they are
convinced of it as such, is the doing Good to a Cause which every Party
may be supposed to look upon as the most meritorious. The Unsoundness of
this Principle has been so often exposed, and is so universally
acknowledged, that a Man must be an utter Stranger to the Principles,
either of natural Religion or Christianity, who suffers himself to be
guided by it. If a Man might promote the supposed Good of his Country by
the blackest Calumnies and Falshoods, our Nation abounds more in
Patriots than any other of the Christian <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec507.txt')">World</a>. When _Pompey_ was
desired not to set Sail in a Tempest that would hazard his Life, _It is
necessary for me_, says he, _to Sail, but it is not necessary for me to
Live_: [1] Every Man should say to himself, with the same Spirit, It is
my Duty to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec507.txt')">speak</a> Truth, tho' it is not my Duty to be in an Office. One
of the Fathers hath carried this Point so high, as to declare, _He would
not tell a Lie, tho' he were sure to gain Heaven by it_. However
extravagant such a Protestation may appear, every one will own, that a
Man may say very reasonably, _He would not tell a Lie, if he were sure
to gain Hell by it_; or, if you have a mind to soften the Expression,
that he would not tell a Lie to gain any Temporal Reward by it, when he
should run the hazard of losing much more than it was possible for him
to gain.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Quoted from Plutarch's Life, § 50. Terser in the
