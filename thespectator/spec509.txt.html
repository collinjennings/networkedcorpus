<p>No. 509.               Tuesday, October 14, 1712.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Hominis frugi et temperantis functus officium.'</p><p>Ter.</p><p></p><p>The useful Knowledge in the following Letter shall have a Place in my
Paper, tho' there is nothing in it which immediately regards the Polite
or the Learned <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec509.txt')">World</a>; I say immediately, for upon Reflection every Man
will find there is a remote Influence upon his own Affairs, in the
Prosperity or Decay of the Trading Part of Mankind. My present
Correspondent, I believe, was never in Print before; but what he says
well deserves a general Attention, tho' delivered in his own homely
Maxims, and a Kind of Proverbial Simplicity; which Sort of Learning has
rais'd more Estates than ever were, or will be, from attention to
_Virgil, Horace, Tully, Seneca, Plutarch_, or any of the rest, whom, I
dare say, this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec509.txt')">worthy</a> Citizen would hold to be indeed ingenious, but
unprofitable Writers. But to the Letter.</p><p></p><p>_Broadstreet, Oct._ 10, 1712.</p><p>_Mr._ WILLIAM SPECTATOR,</p><p>SIR,</p><p>'I accuse you of many Discourses on the Subject of <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec509.txt')">Money</a>, which you
have heretofore promis'd the Publick, but have not discharg'd your
self thereof. But, forasmuch as you seem to depend upon Advice from
others what to do in that Point, have sate down to write you the
Needful upon that Subject. But, before I enter thereupon, I shall take
this Opportunity to observe to you, that the thriving frugal Man shews
it in every Part of his Expence, Dress, Servants, and House; and I
must in the first place, complain to you, as SPECTATOR, that in these
Particulars there is at this Time, throughout the City of _London_, a
lamentable Change from that Simplicity of Manners, which is the true
Source of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec509.txt')">Wealth</a> and Prosperity. I just now said, the Man of Thrift
shews Regularity in every thing; but you may, perhaps, laugh that I
take Notice of such a Particular as I am going to do, for an Instance
that this City is declining, if their antient Oeconomy is not
restor'd. The Thing which gives me this Prospect, and so much Offence,
is the Neglect of the _Royal-Exchange_, I mean the Edifice so called,
and the Walks appertaining thereunto. The _Royal-Exchange_ is a
Fabrick that well deserves to be so called, as well to express that
our Monarch's highest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec509.txt')">Glory</a> and Advantage consists in being the
Patrons of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec509.txt')">Trade</a>, as that it is commodious for Business, and an
Instance of the Grandeur both of Prince and <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec509.txt')">People</a>. But alas! at
present it hardly seems to be set apart for any such Use or Purpose.
Instead of the Assembly of honourable Merchants, substantial
Tradesmen, and knowing Masters of Ships; the Mumpers, the Halt, the
Blind, and the Lame; your Venders of Trash, Apples, Plumbs; your
Ragamuffins, Rakeshames, and Wenches, have justled the greater Number
of the former out of that Place. Thus it is, especially on the
Evening-Change; so that what with the Din of Squalings, Oaths and
Cries of Beggars, Men of the greatest Consequence in our City absent
themselves from the Place. This Particular, by the way, is of evil
Consequence; for if the Change be no Place for Men of the highest
Credit to frequent, it will not be a Disgrace to those of less
Abilities to absent. I remember the time when Rascally <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec509.txt')">Company</a> were
kept out, and the unlucky Boys with Toys and Balls were whipped away
by a Beadle. I have seen this done indeed of late, but then it has
been only to chase the Lads from Chuck, that the Beadle might seize
their Copper.</p><p>I must repeat the Abomination, that the Walnut Trade is carry'd on by
old Women within the Walks, which makes the Place impassable by reason
of Shells and Trash. The Benches around are so filthy, that no one can
sit down, yet the Beadles and Officers have the Impudence at
_Christmas_ to ask for their Box, though they deserve the Strapado. I
do not think it impertinent to have mentioned this, because it speaks
a neglect in the Domestick Care of the City, and the Domestick is the
truest Picture of a Man every where else.</p><p>But I designed to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec509.txt')">speak</a> on the Business of Money and Advancement of
Gain. The Man proper for this, speaking in the general, is of a
sedate, plain, good Understanding, not apt to go out of his way, but
so behaving himself at home, that Business may come to him. Sir
_William Turner_, that valuable Citizen, has left behind him a most
excellent Rule, and couched it in very few Words, suited to the
meanest Capacity. He would say, _Keep your Shop and your Shop will
keep you_. It must be confessed, that if a Man of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec509.txt')">great</a> Genius could
add Steadiness to his Vivacities, or substitute slower Men of Fidelity
to transact the methodical part of his Affairs, such a one would
outstrip the rest of the World: But Business and Trade is not to be
managed by the same Heads which write Poetry, and make Plans for the
Conduct of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec509.txt')">Life</a> in general. So tho' we are at this day beholden to the
late witty and inventive Duke of _Buckingham_ for the whole Trade and
Manufacture of Glass, yet I suppose there is no one will aver, that,
were his Grace yet living, they would not rather deal with my diligent
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec509.txt')">Friend</a> and Neighbour, Mr. _Gumley_, for any Goods to be prepared and
delivered on such a Day, than he would with that illustrious Mechanick
abovementioned.</p><p>'No, no, _Mr_. SPECTATOR, you Wits must not pretend to be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec509.txt')">rich</a>; and it
is possible the Reason may be, in some Measure, because you despise,
or at least you do not value it enough to let it take up your chief
Attention; which the Trader must do, or lose his Credit, which is to
him what <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec509.txt')">Honour</a>, Reputation, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec509.txt')">Fame</a>, or Glory is to other sort of Men.</p><p>'I shall not speak to the Point of Cash it self, till I see how you
approve of these my Maxims in general: But, I think, a Speculation
upon _Many a Little makes a Mickle, A Penny sav'd is a Penny got,
Penny wise and Pound foolish, It is Need that makes the old Wife
trot_, would be very useful to the World, and if you treated them with
Knowledge would be useful to your self, for it would make Demands for
your Paper among those who have no Notion of it at present. But of
these Matters more hereafter. If you did this, as you excel many
Writers of the present Age for Politeness, so you would outgo the
Author of the true Strops of Razors for Use.</p><p>'I shall conclude this Discourse with an Explanation of a Proverb,
which by vulgar Errour is taken and used when a Man is reduced to an
Extremity, whereas the Propriety of the Maxim is to use it when you
would say, there is Plenty, but you must make such a Choice, as not to
hurt another who is to come after you.</p><p>'Mr. _Tobias Hobson_, from whom we have the Expression, was a very
honourable Man, for I shall ever <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec509.txt')">call</a> the Man so who gets an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec509.txt')">Estate</a>
honestly. Mr. _Tobias Hobson_ was a Carrier, and being a Man of great
Abilities and Invention, and one that saw where there might good
Profit arise, though the duller Men overlooked it; this ingenious Man
was the first in this Island who let out Hackney-Horses. He lived in
_Cambridge_, and observing that the Scholars rid hard, his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec509.txt')">manner</a> was
to keep a large Stable of Horses, with Boots, Bridles, and Whips to
furnish the Gentlemen at once, without going from College to College
to borrow, as they have done since the Death of this worthy Man: I
say, Mr. _Hobson_ kept a Stable of forty good Cattle, always ready and
fit for travelling; but when a Man came for a Horse, he was led into
the Stable, where there was great Choice, but he obliged him to take
the Horse which stood next to the Stable-Door; so that every Customer
was alike well served according to his Chance, and every Horse ridden
with the same Justice: From whence it became a Proverb, when what
ought to be your Election was forced upon you, to say, _Hobson's
Choice_. This memorable Man stands drawn in Fresco at an Inn (which he
used) in _Bishopsgate-street_, with an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec509.txt')">hundred</a> Pound Bag under his
Arm, with this Inscription upon the said Bag,</p><p>'The fruitful Mother of an Hundred more.'</p><p>'Whatever Tradesman will try the Experiment, and begin the day after
you publish this my Discourse to treat his Customers all alike, and
all reasonably and honestly, I will ensure him the same Success.</p><p>I am, Sir,
Your loving Friend,</p><p>Hezekiah Thrift</p><p>
