<p>No. 511.              Thursday, October 16, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Quis non invenit turbâ quod amaret in illâ?'</p><p>Ovid,</p><p></p><p>_<a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec511.txt')">Dear</a>_ SPEC.</p><p>'Finding that my last Letter took, I do intend to continue my
epistolary Correspondence with thee, on those dear confounded
Creatures, _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec511.txt')">Women</a>_. Thou knowest, all the little Learning I am Master
of is upon that Subject; I never looked in a Book, but for their
sakes. I have lately met with two pure Stories for a _Spectator_,
which I am sure will please mightily, if they pass through thy <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec511.txt')">Hands</a>.
The first of them I found by chance in a _English_ Book called
_Herodotus_, that lay in my Friend _Dapperwit's_ Window, as I visited
him one Morning. It luckily opened in the Place where I met with the
following Account. He tells us that it was the Manner among the
_Persians_ to have several Fairs in the Kingdom, at which all the
<a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec511.txt')">young</a> unmarried Women were annually exposed to Sale. The Men who
wanted Wives came hither to provide themselves: Every <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec511.txt')">Woman</a> was given
to the highest Bidder, and the Mony which she fetched laid aside for
the publick Use, to be employed as thou shalt hear by and by. By this
means the richest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec511.txt')">People</a> had the Choice of the Market, and culled out
all the most extraordinary Beauties. As soon as the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec511.txt')">Fair</a> was thus
picked, the Refuse was to be distributed among the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec511.txt')">Poor</a>, and among
those who could not go to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec511.txt')">Price</a> of a _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec511.txt')">Beauty</a>_ Several of these
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec511.txt')">married</a> the _Agreeables_, without paying a Farthing for them, unless
somebody chanced to think it worth his while to bid for them, in which
Case the best Bidder was always the Purchaser. But now you must know,
SPEC. it happened in _Persia_ as it does in our own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec511.txt')">Country</a>, that
there were as many _ugly Women_, as _Beauties_ or _Agreeables;_ so
that by Consequence, after  the Magistrates had put off a great many,
there were still a great many that stuck upon their Hands. In order
therefore to clear the Market, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec511.txt')">Money</a> which the Beauties had sold
for, was disposed of among the Ugly; so that a poor Man, who could not
afford to have a Beauty for his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec511.txt')">Wife</a>, was forced to take up with a
Fortune; the greatest Portion being always given to the most Deformed.
To this the Author adds, that every poor Man was forced to live kindly
with his Wife, or in case he repented of his Bargain, to return her
Portion with her to the next publick Sale.</p><p>What I would recommend to thee on this Occasion is, to establish such
an imaginary Fair in _Great Britain_: Thou couldst make it very
pleasant, by matching Women of Quality with Coblers and Carmen, or
describing Titles and Garters leading off in great Ceremony
Shop-keepers and Farmers Daughters. Tho' to tell thee the Truth, I am
confoundedly afraid that as the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec511.txt')">love</a> of Mony prevails in our Island
more than it did in _Persia_, we should find that some of our greatest
Men would chuse out the Portions, and rival one another for the
richest Piece of Deformity; and that on the contrary, the Toasts and
Belles would be bought up by extravagant Heirs, Gamesters and
Spendthrifts. Thou couldst make very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec511.txt')">pretty</a> Reflections upon this
Occasion in Honour of the _Persian_ Politicks, who took care, by such
Marriages, to beautify the upper part of the Species, and to make the
greatest Persons in the Government the most graceful. But this I shall
leave to thy judicious Pen.</p><p>'I have another Story to tell thee, which I likewise met with in a
Book. It seems the General of the _Tartars_, after having laid siege
to a strong Town in _China_, and taken it by Storm, would set to Sale
all the Women that were found in it. Accordingly, he put each of them
into a Sack, and after having thoroughly considered the Value of the
Woman who was inclosed, marked the Price that was demanded for her
upon the Sack. There were a great Confluence of Chapmen, that resorted
from every Part, with a Design to purchase, which they were to do
_unsight unseen_. The Book mentions a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec511.txt')">Merchant</a> in particular, who
observing one of the Sacks to be marked pretty high, bargained for it,
and carried it off with him to his House. As he was resting with it
upon a half-way Bridge, he was resolved to take a Survey of his
Purchase: Upon opening the Sack, a little old Woman popped her Head
out of it; at which the Adventurer was in so great a Rage, that he was
going to shoot her out into the River. The old <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec511.txt')">Lady</a>, however, begged
him first of all to hear her Story, by which he learned that she was
sister to a great _Mandarin_, who would infallibly make the Fortune of
his Brother-in-Law as soon as he should know to whose Lot she fell.
Upon which the Merchant again tied her up in his Sack, and carried her
to his House, where she proved an excellent Wife, and procured him all
the Riches from her Brother that she had promised him.</p><p>'I fancy, if I was disposed to dream a second time, I could make a
tolerable Vision upon this Plan. I would suppose all the unmarried
Women in _London_ and _Westminster_ brought to Market in Sacks, with
their respective Prices on each Sack. The first Sack that is sold is
marked with five thousand Pound: Upon the opening of it, I find it
filled with an admirable Housewife, of an agreeable Countenance: The
Purchaser, upon hearing her good Qualities, pays down her Price very
chearfully. The second I would open, should be a five <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec511.txt')">hundred</a> Pound
Sack: The Lady in it, to our surprize, has the Face and Person of a
Toast: As we are wondering how she came to be set at so low a Price,
we hear that she would have been valued at ten thousand Pound, but
that the Publick had made those Abatements for her being a Scold. I
would afterwards find some beautiful, modest, and discreet Woman, that
should be the top of the Market; and perhaps discover half a dozen
Romps tyed up together in the same Sack, at one hundred Pound an Head.
The Prude and the Coquet should be valued at the same Price, tho' the
first should go off the better of the two. I fancy thou wouldst like
such a Vision, had I time to finish it; because, to talk in thy own
way, there is a Moral in it. Whatever thou may'st think of it,
pr'ythee do not make any of thy queer Apologies for this Letter, as
thou didst for my last. The Women love a gay lively Fellow, and are
never angry at the Railleries of one who is their known Admirer. I am
always bitter upon them, but well with them.</p><p>_Thine_,</p><p>HONEYCOMB.</p><p>
