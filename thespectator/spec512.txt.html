<p>No. 512.               Friday, October 17, 1712.                Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Lectorem delectando pariterque monendo.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>There is nothing which we receive with so much Reluctance as Advice. We
look upon the <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec512.txt')">Man</a> who gives it us as offering an Affront to our
Understanding, and treating us like <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec512.txt')">Children</a> or Ideots. We consider the
Instruction as an implicit Censure, and the Zeal which any one shews for
our Good on such an Occasion as a Piece of Presumption or Impertinence.
The Truth of it is, the Person who pretends to advise, does, in that
particular, exercise a Superiority over us, and can have no other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec512.txt')">Reason</a>
for it, but that in comparing us with himself, he thinks us defective
either in our Conduct or our Understanding. For these Reasons, there is
nothing so difficult as the Art of making Advice <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec512.txt')">agreeable</a>; and indeed
all the Writers, both Ancient and Modern, have distinguished themselves
among one another, according to the Perfection at which they have
arrived in this Art. How many Devices have been made use of, to render
this bitter Potion palatable? Some convey their Instructions to us in
the best chosen Words, others in the most harmonious Numbers, some in
Points of Wit, and others in short Proverbs.</p><p>In the next place, if we look into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec512.txt')">human</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec512.txt')">Nature</a>, we shall find that the
Mind is never so much pleased, as when she exerts her self in any <a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec512.txt')">Action</a>
that gives her an Idea of her own Perfections and Abilities. This
natural Pride and <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec512.txt')">Ambition</a> of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec512.txt')">Soul</a> is very much gratified in the
reading of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec512.txt')">Fable</a>: for in Writings of this kind, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec512.txt')">Reader</a> comes in
for half of the Performance; every thing appears to him like a Discovery
of his own; he is busied all the while in applying Characters and
Circumstances, and is in this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec512.txt')">respect</a> both a Reader and a Composer. It
is no wonder therefore that on such Occasions, when the Mind is thus
pleased with it self, and amused with its own Discoveries, that it is
highly delighted with the Writing which is the occasion of it. For this
reason the _Absalom_ and _Achitophel_ [1] was one of the most popular
Poems that ever appeared in _English_. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec512.txt')">poetry</a> is indeed very fine,
but had it been much finer, it would not have so much pleased, without a
plan which gave the Reader an Opportunity of exerting his own Talents.</p><p>This oblique <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec512.txt')">manner</a> of giving Advice is so inoffensive, that if we look
into ancient Histories, we find the wise Men of old very often chose to
give Counsel to their Kings in Fables. To omit many which will occur to
every one's Memory, there is a pretty Instance of this Nature in a
_Turkish_ Tale, which I do not like the worse for that little Oriental
Extravagance which is mixed with it.</p><p>We are told that the Sultan _Mahmoud_, by his perpetual Wars abroad, and
his Tyranny at home, had filled his Dominions with Ruin and Desolation,
and half unpeopled the _Persian_ Empire. The Visier to this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec512.txt')">great</a> Sultan
(whether an Humourist or an Enthusiast, we are not informed) pretended
to have learned of a certain Dervise to understand the Language of
Birds, so that there was not a Bird that could open his Mouth, but the
Visier knew what it was he said. As he was one Evening with the Emperor,
in their return from Hunting, they saw a couple of Owls upon a Tree that
grew near an old Wall out of an Heap of Rubbish. _I would fain know_,
says the Sultan, _what those two Owls are saying to one another; listen
to their Discourse, and give me an account of it_. The Visier approached
the Tree, pretending to be very attentive to the two Owls. Upon his
return to the Sultan, _Sir_, says he, _I have heard part of their
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec512.txt')">Conversation</a>, but dare not tell you what it is_. The Sultan would not be
satisfied with such an Answer, but forced him to repeat <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec512.txt')">word</a> for word
every thing the Owls had said. _You must know then_, said the
Visier, _that one of these Owls has a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec512.txt')">Son</a>, and the other a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec512.txt')">Daughter</a>,
between whom they are now upon a Treaty of Marriage. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec512.txt')">Father</a> of the
Son said to the Father of the Daughter, in my hearing, Brother, I
consent to this Marriage, provided you will settle upon your Daughter
fifty ruined Villages for her Portion. To which the Father of the
Daughter replied, Instead of fifty I will give her five hundred, if you
please. God grant a long Life to Sultan_ Mahmoud; _whilst he reigns over
us, we shall never want ruined Villages_.</p><p>The Story says, the Sultan was so touched with the Fable, that he
rebuilt the Towns and Villages which had been destroyed, and from that
time forward consulted the Good of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec512.txt')">People</a>. [2]</p><p>To fill up my Paper, I shall add a most ridiculous piece of natural
Magic, which was taught by no less a Philosopher than _Democritus_,
namely, that if the Blood of certain Birds, which he mentioned, were
mixed together, it would produce a Serpent of such a wonderful Virtue,
that whoever did eat it should be skill'd in the Language of Birds, and
understand every thing they said to one another. Whether the Dervise
abovementioned might not have eaten such a Serpent, I shall leave to the
Determinations of the Learned.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Dryden's satire on the intrigues of the Duke of Monmouth
