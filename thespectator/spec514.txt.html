<p>No. 514.               Monday, October 20, [1] 1712.            Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Me Parnassi deserta per ardua, dulcis
Raptat Amor; juvat ire jugis qua nulla priorum
Castaliam molle divertitur Orbita Clivo.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I came home a little later than usual the other Night, and not
finding my self inclined to <a name="topic45" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec514.txt')">sleep</a>, I took up _Virgil_ to divert me
till I should be more disposed to Rest. He is the Author whom I always
chuse on such Occasions, no one writing in so divine, so harmonious,
nor so equal a Strain, which leaves the Mind composed, and softened
into an agreeable Melancholy; the Temper in which, of all others, I
chuse to close the Day. The Passages I turned to were those <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec514.txt')">beautiful</a>
Raptures in his _Georgicks_, where he professes himself entirely given
up to the Muses, and smit with the Love of Poetry, passionately
wishing to be transported to the cool Shades and Retirements of the
Mountain _Hæmus_. I clos'd the Book and went to Bed. What I had just
before been reading made so strong an Impression on my Mind, that
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec514.txt')">Fancy</a> seemed almost to fulfil to me the Wish of _Virgil_, in
presenting to me the following <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec514.txt')">Vision</a>.</p><p>'<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec514.txt')">Methought</a> I was on a sudden plac'd in the Plains of _Boeotia_, where
at the end of the Horizon I saw the Mountain _Parnassus_ rising before
me. The Prospect was of so large an Extent, that I had long wander'd
about to find a Path which should directly lead me to it, had I not
seen at some distance a Grove of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec514.txt')">Trees</a>, which in a Plain that had
nothing else remarkable enough in it to fix my Sight, immediately
determined me to go thither. When I arrived at it, I found it parted
out into a <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec514.txt')">great</a> Number of Walks and Alleys, which often widened into
beautiful Openings, as Circles or Ovals, set <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec514.txt')">round</a> with Yews and
Cypresses, with Niches, Grotto's, and Caves placed on the Sides,
encompassed with Ivy. There was no Sound to be heard in the whole
Place, but only that of a gentle Breeze passing over the Leaves of the
Forest, every thing beside was buried in a profound Silence. I was
captivated with the Beauty and Retirement of the Place, and never so
much, before that Hour, was pleased with the Enjoyment of my self. I
indulged the Humour, and suffered my self to wander without Choice or
Design. At length, at the end of a Range of Trees, I saw three Figures
seated on a Bank of Moss, with a silent Brook creeping at their Feet.
I ador'd them as the tutelar Divinities of the Place, and stood still
to take a particular View of each of them. The Middlemost, whose Name
was _Solitude_, sat with her Arms across each other, and seemed rather
pensive and wholly taken up with her own Thoughts, than any ways
grieved or displeased. The only Companions which she admitted into
that Retirement, was the Goddess _Silence_, who sat on her right Hand
with her Finger on her Mouth, and on her left _Contemplation_, with
her Eyes fixed upon the Heavens. Before her lay a celestial Globe,
with several Schemes of Mathematical Theorems. She prevented my Speech
with the greatest Affability in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec514.txt')">World</a>: Fear not, said she, I know
your Request before you speak it; you would be led to the Mountain of
the Muses; the only way to it lies thro' this Place, and no one is so
often employ'd in conducting Persons thither as my self. When she had
thus spoken, she rose from her Seat, and I immediately placed my self
under her Direction; but whilst I passed through the Grove, I could
not help enquiring of her who were the Persons admitted into that
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec514.txt')">sweet</a> Retirement. Surely, said I, there can nothing enter here but
Virtue and virtuous Thoughts: The whole Wood seems design'd for the
Reception and Reward of such Persons as have spent their Lives
according to the Dictates of their Conscience and the Commands of the
Gods. You imagine right, said she; assure your self this Place was at
first designed for no other: Such it continued to be in the Reign of
_Saturn_, when none entered here but holy Priests, Deliverers of their
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec514.txt')">Country</a> from Oppression and Tyranny, who repos'd themselves here after
their Labours, and those whom the Study and Love of Wisdom had fitted
for divine Conversation. But now it is become no less dangerous than
it was before desirable: Vice has learned so to mimick Virtue, that it
often creeps in hither under its Disguise. See there! just before you,
_Revenge_ stalking by, habited in the Robe of _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec514.txt')">Honour</a>_. Observe not
far from him _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec514.txt')">Ambition</a>_ standing alone; if you ask him his Name, he
will tell you it is _Emulation_ or _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec514.txt')">Glory</a>_. But the most frequent
Intruder we have is _Lust_, who succeeds now the Deity to whom in
better Days this Grove was entirely devoted. _Virtuous Love_, with
_Hymen_, and the Graces attending him, once reign'd over this happy
Place; a whole Train of Virtues waited on him, and no dishonourable
Thought durst presume for Admittance: But now! how is the whole
Prospect changed? and how seldom renewed by some few who dare despise
sordid Wealth, and imagine themselves fit Companions for so charming a
Divinity?</p><p>'The Goddess had no sooner said thus, but we were arriv'd at the
utmost Boundaries of the Wood, which lay contiguous to a Plain that
ended at the Foot of the Mountain. Here I kept close to my Guide,
being sollicited by several Phantomes, who assured me they would shew
me a nearer Way to the Mountain of the Muses. Among the rest _Vanity_
was extremely importunate, having deluded infinite Numbers, whom I saw
wandering at the Foot of the Hill. I turned away from this despicable
Troop with Disdain, and addressing my self to my Guide, told her, that
as I had some Hopes I should be able to reach up part of the Ascent,
so I despaired of having Strength enough to attain the Plain on the
Top. But being informed by her that it was impossible to stand upon
the Sides, and that if I did not proceed onwards, I should
irrecoverably fall down to the lowest Verge, I resolved to hazard any
Labour and Hardship in the Attempt: So great a desire had I of
enjoying the Satisfaction I hoped to meet with at the End of my
Enterprize!</p><p>'There were two Paths, which led up by different Ways to the Summit of
the Mountain; the one was guarded by the Genius which presides over
the Moment of our Births. He had it in charge to examine the several
Pretensions of those who desired a Pass that Way, but to admit none
excepting those only on whom _Melpomene_ had look'd with a propitious
Eye at the Hour of their Nativity. The other Way was guarded by
_Diligence_, to whom many of those Persons apply'd who had met with a
Denial the other Way; but he was so tedious in granting their Request,
and indeed after Admittance the Way was so very intricate and
laborious, that many after they had made some Progress, chose rather
to return back than proceed, and very few persisted so long as to
arrive at the End they proposed. Besides these two Paths, which at
length severally led to the Top of the Mountain, there was a third
made up of these two, which a little after the Entrance joined in one.
This carried those happy Few, whose good Fortune it was to find it,
directly to the Throne of _Apollo_. I don't know whether I should even
now have had the Resolution to have demanded Entrance at either of
these Doors, had I not seen a Peasant-like Man (followed by a numerous
and lovely Train of Youths of both Sexes) insist upon Entrance for all
whom he led up. He put me in mind of the Country Clown who is painted
in the Map for leading Prince _Eugene_ over the _Alps_. He had a
Bundle of Papers in his Hand, and producing several, which he said,
were given to him by Hands which he knew _Apollo_ would allow as
Passes; among which, methoughts, I saw some of my own Writing; the
whole Assembly was admitted, and gave, by their Presence, a new Beauty
and Pleasure to these happy Mansions. I found the Man did not pretend
to enter himself, but served as a kind of Forester in the Lawns to
direct Passengers, who by their own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec514.txt')">Merit</a>, or Instructions he procured
for them, had Virtue enough to travel that way. I looked very
attentively upon this kind homely Benefactor, and forgive me, _Mr._
SPECTATOR, if I own to you I took him for your self. We were no sooner
entered, but we were sprinkled three times with the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec514.txt')">Water</a> of the
Fountain _Aganippe_, which had Power to deliver us from all Harms, but
only Envy, which reached even to the End of our Journey. We had not
proceeded far in the middle Path when we arrived at the Summit of the
Hill, where there immediately appeared to us two Figures, which
extremely engaged my Attention: the one was a young Nymph in the Prime
of her Youth and Beauty; she had Wings on her Shoulders and Feet, and
was able to transport herself to the most distant Regions in the
smallest Space of Time. She was continually varying her Dress,
sometimes into the most natural and becoming Habits in the World, and
at others into the most wild and freakish Garb that can be imagined.
There stood by her a Man full-aged, and of great Gravity, who
corrected her Inconsistences, by shewing them in his Mirror, and still
flung her affected and unbecoming Ornaments down the Mountain, which
fell in the Plain below, and were gathered up and wore with great
Satisfaction by those that inhabited it. The Name of the Nymph was
_Fancy_, the Daughter of _Liberty_, the most beautiful of all the
Mountain-Nymphs. The other was _Judgment_, the Off-spring of _Time_,
and the only Child he acknowledged to be his. A Youth, who sat upon a
Throne just between them, was their genuine Offspring; his Name was
_Wit_, and his Seat was composed of the Works of the most celebrated
Authors. I could not but see with a secret Joy, that though the
_Greeks_ and _Romans_ made the Majority, yet our own Countrymen were
the next both in Number and Dignity. I was now at Liberty to take a
full Prospect of that delightful Region. I was inspired with new
Vigour and Life, and saw every thing in nobler and more pleasing Views
than before; I breathed a purer Æther in a Sky which was a continued
Azure, gilded with perpetual Sunshine. The two Summits of the Mountain
rose on each Side, and formed in the midst a most delicious Vale, the
Habitation of the Muses, and of such as had composed Works <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec514.txt')">worthy</a> of
Immortality. _Apollo_ was seated upon a Throne of Gold, and for a
Canopy an aged Laurel spread its Boughs and its Shade over his Head.
His Bow and Quiver lay at his Feet. He held his Harp in his Hand,
whilst the Muses round about him celebrated with Hymns his Victory
over the Serpent _Python_, and sometimes sung in softer Notes the
Loves of _Leucothoe_ and _Daphnis_. _Homer_, _Virgil_, and _Milton_
were seated the next to them. Behind were a great Number of others,
among whom I was surprized to see some in the Habit of _Laplanders_,
who, notwithstanding the Uncouthness of their Dress, had lately
obtained a Place upon the Mountain. I saw _Pindar_ walking all alone,
no one daring to accost him, till _Cowley_ join'd himself to him; but
growing weary of one who almost walked him out of breath, he left him
for _Horace_ and _Anacreon_, with whom he seemed infinitely delighted.</p><p>'A little further I saw another Groupe of Figures; I made up to them,
and found it was _Socrates_ dictating to _Xenophon_, and the Spirit of
_Plato_; but most of all, _Musoeus_ had the greatest Audience about
him. I was at too great a Distance to hear what he said, or to
discover the Faces of his Hearers; only I thought I now perceived
_Virgil_, who had joined them, and stood in a Posture full of
Admiration at the Harmony of his Words.</p><p>'Lastly, At the very Brink of the Hill I saw _Boccalini_ sending
Dispatches to the World below of what happened upon _Parnassus_; but I
perceived he did it without leave of the Muses, and by stealth, and
was unwilling to have them revised by _Apollo_. I could now from this
Height and serene Sky behold the infinite Cares and Anxieties with
which Mortals below sought out their way through the Maze of Life. I
saw the Path of Virtue lie strait before them, whilst Interest, or
some malicious Demon, still hurry'd them out of the Way. I was at once
touched with Pleasure at my own Happiness, and Compassion at the sight
of their inextricable Errors. Here the two contending Passions rose so
high, that they were inconsistent with the sweet Repose I enjoy'd, and
awaking with a sudden start, the only Consolation I could admit of for
my Loss, was the Hopes that this Relation of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec514.txt')">Dream</a> will not
displease you.' [2]</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Room is made for this paper, in the original issue,
