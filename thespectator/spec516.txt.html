<p>No. 516.               Wednesday, October 22, 1712.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Immortale odium et nunquam sanabile vulnus.
Inde furor vulgo, quod Numina vicinorum
Odit uterque locus, quum solos credit habendos
Esse Deos quos ipse colat.'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>Of all the monstrous Passions and Opinions which have crept into the
<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec516.txt')">World</a>, there is none so wonderful as that those who profess the common
Name of _Christians_, should pursue each other with Rancour and Hatred
for Differences in their Way of following the Example of their Saviour.
It seems so natural that all who pursue the Steps of any Leader should
form themselves after his Manners, that it is impossible to account for
Effects so different from what we might expect from those who profess
themselves Followers of the highest Pattern of Meekness and Charity, but
by ascribing such Effects to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec516.txt')">Ambition</a> and Corruption of those who
are so audacious, with Souls full of Fury, to serve at the Altars of the
<a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec516.txt')">God</a> of Peace.</p><p>The Massacres to which the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec516.txt')">Church</a> of _Rome_ has animated the ordinary
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec516.txt')">People</a>, are dreadful Instances of the Truth of this Observation; and
whoever reads the History of the _Irish_ Rebellion, and the Cruelties
which ensued thereupon, will be sufficiently convinced to what Rage poor
Ignorants may be worked up by those who profess Holiness, and become
Incendiaries, and under the Dispensation of Grace, promote Evils
abhorrent to Nature.</p><p>This Subject and Catastrophe, which deserve so well to be remarked by
the Protestant World, will, I doubt not, be considered by the Reverend
and Learned Prelate that Preaches to-morrow before many of the
Descendants, of those who perished on that lamentable Day, in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec516.txt')">manner</a>
suitable to the Occasion, and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec516.txt')">worthy</a> his own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec516.txt')">great</a> Virtue and Eloquence.</p><p>I shall not dwell upon it any further, but only transcribe out of a
little Tract, called, _The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec516.txt')">Christian</a> Hero_, published in 1701, what I
find there in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec516.txt')">Honour</a> of the renowned Hero _William_ III. who rescued
that Nation from the Repetition of the same Disasters. His late Majesty,
of glorious Memory, and the most Christian <a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec516.txt')">King</a>, are considered at the
Conclusion of that Treatise as Heads of the Protestant and Roman
Catholick World in the following Manner.</p><p>'There were not ever, before the Entrance of the Christian Name into
the World, Men who have maintained a more renowned Carriage, than the
two great Rivals who possess the full <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec516.txt')">Fame</a> of the present Age, and
will be the Theme and Examination of the future. They are exactly
form'd by Nature for those Ends to which Heaven seems to have sent
them amongst us: Both animated with a restless Desire of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec516.txt')">Glory</a>, but
pursue it by different Means, and with different Motives. To one it
consists in an extensive undisputed Empire over his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec516.txt')">Subjects</a>, to the
other in their rational and voluntary Obedience: One's Happiness is
founded in their want of Power, the other's in their want of Desire to
oppose him. The one enjoys the Summit of Fortune with the Luxury of a
_Persian_, the other with the Moderation of a _Spartan_: One is made
to oppress, the other to relieve the Oppressed: The one is satisfy'd
with the Pomp and Ostentation of Power to prefer and debase his
Inferiours, the other delighted only with the Cause and Foundation of
it to cherish and protect 'em. To one therefore <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec516.txt')">Religion</a> is but a
convenient Disguise, to the other a vigorous Motive of Action.</p><p>'For without such Ties of real and solid Honour, there is no way of
forming a Monarch, but after the Machiavillian Scheme, by which a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec516.txt')">Prince</a> must ever seem to have all Virtues, but really to be Master of
none, but is to be liberal, merciful and just, only as they serve his
Interests; while, with the noble Art of Hypocrisy, Empire would be to
be extended, and new Conquests be made by new Devices, by which prompt
Address his Creatures might insensibly give Law in the Business of
Life, by leading Men in the Entertainment of it. [1]</p><p>'Thus when Words and Show are apt to pass for the substantial <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec516.txt')">things</a>
they are only to express, there would need no more to enslave a
Country but to adorn a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec516.txt')">Court</a>; for while every Man's Vanity makes him
believe himself capable of becoming Luxury, Enjoyments are a ready
Bait for Sufferings, and the Hopes of Preferment Invitations to
Servitude; which Slavery would be colour'd with all the Agreements, as
they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec516.txt')">call</a> it, imaginable. The noblest Arts and Artists, the finest
Pens and most elegant Minds, jointly employ'd to set it off, with the
various Embellishments of sumptuous Entertainments, charming
Assemblies, and polished Discourses; and those apostate Abilities of
Men, the adored Monarch might profusely and skilfully encourage, while
they flatter his Virtue, and gild his Vice at so high a rate, that he,
without Scorn of the one, or Love of the other, would alternately and
occasionally use both: So that his Bounty should support him in his
Rapines, his Mercy in his Cruelties.</p><p>'Nor is it to give things a more severe Look than is natural, to
suppose such must be the Consequences of a Prince's having no other
Pursuit than that of his own Glory; for, if we consider an Infant born
into the World, and beholding it self the mightiest thing in it, it
self the present Admiration and future Prospect of a fawning People,
who profess themselves great or mean, according to the Figure he is to
make amongst them, what Fancy would not be debauched to believe they
were but what they professed themselves, his mere Creatures, and use
them as such by purchasing with their Lives a boundless Renown, which
he, for want of a more just Prospect, would place in the Number of his
Slaves, and the Extent of his Territories? Such undoubtedly would be
the tragical Effects of a Prince's living with no Religion, which are
not to be surpassed but by his having a false one.</p><p>'If Ambition were spirited with Zeal, what would follow, but that his
People should be converted into an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec516.txt')">Army</a>, whose Swords can make Right
in Power, and solve Controversy in Belief? And if Men should be
stiff-neck'd to the Doctrine of that visible Church, let them be
contented with an Oar and a Chain, in the midst of Stripes and
Anguish, to contemplate on him, _whose Yoke is easy, and whose Burthen
is light_.</p><p>'With a Tyranny begun on his own Subjects, and Indignation that others
draw their Breath independent of his Frown or Smile, why should he not
proceed to the Seizure of the World? And if nothing but the Thirst of
Sway were the Motive of his Actions, why should Treaties be other than
mere Words, or solemn national Compacts be any thing but an Halt in
the March of that Army, who are never to lay down their Arms, till all
Men are reduc'd to the necessity of hanging their Lives on his wayward
Will; who might supinely, and at leisure, expiate his own Sins by
other Mens Sufferings, while he daily meditates new Slaughter, and new
Conquest?</p><p>'For mere Man, when giddy with unbridled Power, is an insatiate Idol,
not to be appeased with Myriads offer'd to his Pride, which may be
puffed up by the Adulation of a base and prostrate World, into an
Opinion that he is something more than human, by being something less:
And, alas, what is there that mortal Man will not believe of himself,
when complimented with the Attributes of God? Can he then conceive
Thoughts of a Power as _Omnipresent_ as his! But should there be such
a Foe of Mankind now upon Earth, have our Sins so far provoked Heaven,
that we are left utterly naked to his Fury? Is there no Power, no
Leader, no Genius, that can conduct and animate us to our Death or our
Defence? Yes; our great God never gave one to feign by his Permission,
but he gave to another also to reign by his Grace.</p><p>'All the Circumstances of the illustrious Life of our Prince, seem to
have conspired to make him the Check and Bridle of Tyranny; for his
Mind has been strengthened and confirmed by one continual Struggle,
and Heaven has educated him by Adversity to a quick Sense of the
Distresses and Miseries of Mankind, which he was born to redress: In
just scorn of the trivial Glories and light Ostentations of Power,
that glorious Instrument of Providence moves, like that, in a steddy,
calm, and silent Course, independent either of Applause or Calumny;
which renders him, if not in a political, yet in a moral, a
philosophick, an heroick, and a Christian Sense, an absolute Monarch;
who satisfy'd with this unchangeable, just, and ample Glory, must
needs turn all his Regards from himself to the Service of others; for
he begins his Enterprize with his own Share in the Success of them;
for Integrity bears in it self its Reward, nor can that which depends
not on Event ever know Disappointment.</p><p>'With the undoubted Character of a glorious Captain, and (what he much
more values than the most splendid Titles) that of a sincere and
honest Man, he is the Hope and Stay of _Europe_, an universal Good not
to be engrossed by us only, for distant Potentates implore his
Friendship, and injur'd Empires court his Assistance. He rules the
World, not by an Invasion of the People of the Earth, but the Address
of its Princes; and if that World should be again rous'd from the
Repose which his prevailing Arms had given it, why should we not hope
that there is an Almighty, by whose Influence the terrible Enemy that
thinks himself prepar'd for Battel, may find he is but ripe for
Destruction? and that there may be in the Womb of Time great
Incidents, which may make the Catastrophe of a prosperous Life as
unfortunate as the particular Scenes of it were successful? For there
does not want a skilful Eye and resolute Arm to observe and grasp the
Occasion: A Prince, who from [2]</p><p>'--Fuit Ilium et ingens

_Christian Hero_. At this part a few lines have been omitted. In the
original the paragraph closed thus:</p><p>'... the Entertainment of it, and making their great Monarch the
Fountain of all that's delicate and refined, and his Court the Model
for Opinions in Pleasure, as well as the Pattern in Dress; which might
prevail so far upon an undiscerning world as (to accomplish it or its
approaching Slavery) to make it receive a superfluous Babble for an
Universal Language.']</p><p>
[Footnote 2: Here Steele abruptly breaks with 'Fuit Ilium'--the glory
has departed--on the sentence:</p><p>'A Prince who from just Notion of his Duty to that Being to whom he
must be accountable, has in the Service of his Fellow Creatures a
noble Contempt of Pleasures, and Patience of Labours, to whom 'tis
Hereditary to be the Guardian and Asserter of the native Rights and
Liberties of Mankind;'</p><p>A few more clauses to the sentence formed the summary of William's
character before the book closed with a prayer that Heaven would guard
his important life.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
