<p>No. 517.               Thursday, October 23, 1712.              Addison.</p><p>
'Heu Pietas! heu prisca Fides!'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>We last night received a Piece of ill News at our Club, which very
sensibly afflicted every one of us. I question not but my Readers
themselves will be troubled at the hearing of it. To keep them no longer
in Suspence, Sir ROGER DE COVERLY _is dead_. [1] He departed this Life
at his House in the Country, after a few Weeks Sickness. Sir ANDREW
FREEPORT has a Letter from one of his Correspondents in those Parts,
that informs him the old Man caught a Cold at the County-Sessions, as he
was very warmly promoting an Address of his own penning, in which he
succeeded according to his Wishes, But this Particular comes from a
Whig-Justice of Peace, who was always Sir ROGER'S Enemy and Antagonist.
I have Letters both from the Chaplain and Captain _Sentry_ which mention
nothing of it, but are filled with many Particulars to the Honour of the
good old Man. I have likewise a Letter from the Butler, who took so much
care of me last Summer when I was at the Knight's House. As my Friend
the Butler mentions, in the Simplicity of his <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec517.txt')">Heart</a>, several
Circumstances the others have passed over in Silence, I shall give my
Reader a Copy of his Letter, without any Alteration or Diminution.</p><p>
_Honoured Sir_,</p><p>'Knowing that you was my old Master's good Friend, I could not forbear
sending you the melancholy News of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec517.txt')">Death</a>, which has afflicted the
whole Country, as well as his poor Servants, who loved him, I may say,
better than we did our Lives. I am afraid he caught his Death the last
County Sessions, where he would go to see Justice done to a poor Widow
Woman, and her Fatherless Children, that had been wronged by a
neighbouring Gentleman; for you know, Sir, my good Master was always
the poor Man's Friend. Upon his coming home, the first Complaint he
made was, that he had lost his Roast-Beef Stomach, not being able to
touch a Sirloin, which was served up according to Custom; and you know
he used to take great Delight in it. From that time forward he grew
worse and worse, but still kept a good Heart to the last. Indeed we
were once in great [Hope [2]] of his Recovery, upon a kind Message
that was sent him from the Widow Lady whom he had made love to the
Forty last Years of his Life; but this only proved a Light'ning before
Death. He has bequeathed to this Lady, as a token of his Love, a great
Pearl Necklace, and a Couple of Silver Bracelets set with Jewels,
which belonged to my good old Lady his Mother: He has bequeathed the
fine white Gelding, that he used to ride a hunting upon, to his
Chaplain, because he thought he would be kind to him, and has left you
all his Books. He has, moreover, bequeathed to the Chaplain a very
pretty Tenement with good Lands about it. It being a very cold Day
when he made his Will, he left for Mourning, to every Man in the
Parish, a great Frize-Coat, and to every Woman a black Riding-hood. It
was a most moving Sight to see him take leave of his poor Servants,
commending us all for our Fidelity, whilst we were not able to speak a
Word for weeping. As we most of us are grown Gray-headed in our Dear
Master's Service, he has left us Pensions and Legacies, which we may
live very comfortably upon, the remaining part of our Days.</p><p>He has bequeath'd a great deal more in Charity, which is not yet come
to my Knowledge, and it is peremptorily said in the Parish, that he
has left Mony to build a Steeple to the Church; for he was heard to
say some time ago, that if he lived two Years longer, _Coverly_ Church
should have a Steeple to it. The Chaplain tells every body that he
made a very good End, and never speaks of him without <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec517.txt')">Tears</a>. He was
buried according to his own Directions, among the Family of the
_Coverly's_, on the Left Hand of his Father Sir _Arthur_. The Coffin
was carried by Six of his Tenants, and the Pall held up by Six of the
_Quorum_: The whole Parish follow'd the Corps with heavy Hearts, and
in their Mourning Suits, the Men in Frize, and the Women in
Riding-Hoods. Captain SENTRY, my Master's Nephew, has taken Possession
of the Hall-House, and the whole Estate. When my old Master saw him a
little before his Death, he shook him by the Hand, and wished him Joy
of the Estate which was falling to him, desiring him only to make good
Use of it, and to pay the several Legacies, and the Gifts of Charity
which he told him he had left as Quitrents upon the Estate. The
Captain truly seems a courteous Man, though he says but little. He
makes much of those whom my Master loved, and shews great Kindness to
the old House-dog, that you know my poor Master was so fond of. It
would have gone to your Heart to have heard the Moans the dumb
Creature made on the Day of my Master's Death. He has ne'er joyed
himself since; no more has any of us. 'Twas the melancholiest Day for
the poor People that ever happened in _Worcestershire_. This being all
from,</p><p>_Honoured Sir,</p><p>Your most Sorrowful Servant_,</p><p>Edward Biscuit.</p><p>_P. S._ 'My Master desired, some Weeks before he died, that a Book
which comes up to you by the Carrier should be given to Sir _Andrew
Freeport_, in his Name.'</p><p>
This Letter, notwithstanding the poor Butler's Manner of writing it,
gave us such an Idea of our good old Friend, that upon the reading of it
there was not a dry Eye in the Club. Sir _Andrew_ opening the Book,
found it to be a Collection of Acts of Parliament. There was in
particular the Act of Uniformity, with some Passages in it marked by Sir
_Roger's_ own Hand. Sir _Andrew_ found that they related to two or three
Points, which he had disputed with Sir _Roger_ the last time he appeared
at the Club. Sir _Andrew_, who would have been merry at such an Incident
on another Occasion, at the sight of the old Man's Hand-writing burst
into Tears, and put the Book into his Pocket. Captain _Sentry_ informs
me, that the Knight has left Rings and Mourning for every one in the
Club.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: In No. 1 of the _Bee_ (for February, 1733) Eustace Budgell,
who set up that publication, and who probably was the intimate friend of
Addison's to whom he there refers, said of Sir Roger de Coverley,</p><p>'Mr. Addison was so fond of this character that a little before he
laid down the _Spectator_ (foreseeing that some nimble gentleman would
catch up his pen the moment he quitted it) he said to an intimate
friend, with a certain warmth in his expression which he was not often
guilty of, By God, I'll kill Sir Roger, that nobody else may murder
him.'</p><p>Accordingly the whole _Spectator_ No. 517 consists of nothing but an
account of the old knight's death, and some moving circumstances which
attended it. Steele had by this date resolved on bringing his Spectator
to a close, and Addison's paper on the death of Sir Roger, the first of
several which are to dispose of all members of the Spectator's Club and
break up the Club itself, was the first clear warning to the public that
he had such an intention.]</p><p>
