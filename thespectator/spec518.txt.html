<p>No. 518.              Friday, October 24, 1712.               Steele [1]</p><p></p><p>'--Miserum est alienæ incumbere famæ,
Ne collapsa ruant subductis tecta columnis.'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>This being a Day of Business with me, I must make the present
Entertainment like a Treat at an House-warming, out of such Presents as
have been sent me by my Guests. The first Dish which I serve up is a
Letter come fresh to my Hand.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>It is with inexpressible Sorrow that I hear of the Death of good Sir
_Roger_, and do heartily condole with you upon so melancholy an
Occasion. I think you ought to have blacken'd the Edges of a Paper
which brought us so ill News, and to have had it stamped likewise in
Black. It is expected of you that you should write his Epitaph, and,
if possible, fill his Place in the <a name="topic46" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec518.txt')">Club</a> with as worthy and diverting a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec518.txt')">Member</a>. I question not but you will receive many Recommendations from
the publick of such as will appear Candidates for that Post.</p><p>Since I am talking of Death, and have mentioned an Epitaph, I must
tell you, Sir, that I have made discovery of a Church-Yard in which I
believe you might spend an Afternoon, with great Pleasure to your self
and to the Publick: It. belongs to the Church of _Stebon-Heath_,
commonly called _Stepney_. Whether or no it be that the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec518.txt')">People</a> of that
Parish have a particular Genius for an Epitaph, or that there be some
Poet among them who undertakes that Work by the Great, I can't tell;
but there are more remarkable Inscriptions in that place than in any
other I have met with, and I may say without Vanity, that there is not
a Gentleman in _England_ better read in Tomb-stones than my self, my
Studies having laid very much in Church-yards. I shall beg leave to
send you a Couple of Epitaphs, for a Sample of those I have just now
mentioned. They are written in a different <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec518.txt')">manner</a>; the first being in
the diffused and luxuriant, the second in the close contracted Style.
The first has much of the Simple and Pathetick; the second is
something Light, but Nervous. The first is thus:</p><p>'Here Thomas Sapper lyes interred. Ah why!
Born in New England, did in London dye;
Was the third <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec518.txt')">Son</a> of Eight, begot upon
His <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec518.txt')">Mother</a> Martha by his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec518.txt')">Father</a> John.
Much favoured by his Prince he 'gan to be,
But nipt by Death at th' Age of Twenty Three.
Fatal to him was that we Small-pox name,
By which his Mother and two Brethren came
Also to breathe their last nine Years before,
And now have left their Father to deplore
The loss of all his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec518.txt')">Children</a>, with his Wife,
Who was the Joy and Comfort of his Life.'</p><p>
The Second is as follows:</p><p>'Here lies the Body of Daniel Saul,
Spittle-fields Weaver, and that's all.'</p><p>'I will not dismiss you, whilst I am upon this Subject, without
sending a short Epitaph which I once met with, though I cannot
possibly recollect the Place. The Thought of it is serious, and in my
Opinion, the finest that I ever met with upon this Occasion. You know,
Sir, it is usual, after having told us the Name of the Person who lies
interr'd to lanch out into his Praises. This Epitaph takes a quite
contrary Turn, having been made by the Person himself some time before
his Death.</p><p>
'Hic jacet_ R. C. _in expectatione diei supremi. Qualis erat dies
iste indicabit.' [2]</p><p>
Here lieth _R. C_. in expectation of the last Day. What sort of a
Man he was, that Day will discover.</p><p>_I am, SIR, &c_.</p><p></p><p>The following Letter is dated from _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec518.txt')">Cambridge</a>_. [3]</p><p>
_SIR_,</p><p>'Having lately read among your Speculations, an Essay upon
Phisiognomy, I cannot but think that if you made a Visit to this
ancient <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec518.txt')">University</a>, you might receive very considerable Lights upon
that Subject, there being scarce a young Fellow in it who does not
give certain Indications of his particular Humour and Disposition
conformable to the Rules of that Art. In Courts and Cities every body
lays a Constraint upon his Countenance, and endeavours to look like
the rest of the World; but the Youth of this Place, having not yet
formed themselves by <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec518.txt')">Conversation</a>, and the Knowledge of the World,
give their Limbs and Features their full Play.</p><p>'As you have considered Human Nature in all its Lights, you must be
extremely well apprized, that there is a very close Correspondence
between the outward and the inward Man; that scarce the least Dawning,
the least Parturiency towards a Thought can be stirring in the Mind of
Man, without producing a suitable Revolution in his Exteriors, which
will easily discover it self to an Adept in the Theory of the Phiz.
Hence it is, that the intrinsick Worth and Merit of a Son of _Alma
Mater_ is ordinarily calculated from the Cast of his Visage, the
Contour of his Person, the Mechanism of his Dress, the Disposition of
his Limbs, the Manner of his Gate and Air, with a number of
Circumstances of equal Consequence and Information: The Practitioners
in this Art often make use of a Gentleman's Eyes to give 'em Light
into the Posture of his Brains; take a Handle from his Nose, to judge
of the Size of his Intellects; and interpret the over-much Visibility
and Pertness of one Ear, as an infallible mark of Reprobation, and a
Sign the Owner of so saucy a Member fears neither God nor Man. In
conformity to this Scheme, a contracted Brow, a lumpish down-cast
Look, a sober sedate Pace, with both Hands dangling quiet and steddy
in Lines exactly parallel to each Lateral Pocket of the Galligaskins,
is Logick, Metaphysicks and Mathematicks in Perfection. So likewise
the _Belles Lettres_ are typified by a Saunter in the Gate; a Fall of
one Wing of the Peruke backward, an Insertion of one Hand in the Fobb,
and a negligent Swing of the other, with a Pinch of right and fine
_Barcelona_ between Finger and Thumb, a due Quantity of the same upon
the upper Lip, and a Noddle-Case loaden with Pulvil. Again, a grave
solemn stalking Pace is Heroick Poetry, and Politicks; an Unequal one,
a Genius for the Ode, and the modern Ballad: and an open Breast, with
an audacious Display of the Holland Shirt, is construed a fatal
Tendency to the Art Military.</p><p>'I might be much larger upon these Hints, but I know whom I write to.
If you can graft any Speculation upon them, or turn them to the
Advantage of the Persons concerned in them, you will do a Work very
becoming the _British Spectator_, and oblige'</p><p>_Your very Humble Servant_,</p><p>Tom. Tweer.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Of the two letters which form this number the second is by
John Henley, known afterwards as 'Orator Henley,' of whom see a note to
No. 396.]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: The European Magazine for July, 1787, says that the exact
copy of this Epitaph, which is on a Thomas Crouch, who died in 1679,
runs thus:</p><p>_Aperiet Deus tumulos et educet nos de sepulchris
Qualis eram, dies isti haec cum venerit, scies._.]</p><p>
[Footnote 3: By John Henley.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
