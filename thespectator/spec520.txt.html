<p>No. 520.                Monday, October 27, 1712.          Francham. [1]</p><p></p><p>'Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus
Tant chari capitis!'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'The just Value you have expressed for the Matrimonial State, is the
Reason that I now venture to write to you, without <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec520.txt')">Fear</a> of being
ridiculous; and confess to you, that though it is three Months since I
lost a very <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec520.txt')">agreeable</a> <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec520.txt')">Woman</a>, who was my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec520.txt')">Wife</a>, my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec520.txt')">Sorrow</a> is still
fresh; and I am often, in the midst of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec520.txt')">Company</a>, upon any Circumstance
that revives her Memory, with a Reflection what she would say or do on
such an Occasion: I say, upon any Occurrence of that Nature, which I
can give you a Sense of, though I cannot express it wholly, I am all
over Softness, and am obliged to retire, and give Way to a few Sighs
and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec520.txt')">Tears</a>, before I can be easy. I cannot but recommend the Subject of
Male Widowhood to you, and beg of you to touch upon it by the first
Opportunity. To those who have not lived like <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec520.txt')">Husbands</a> during the
Lives of their Spouses, this would be a tasteless Jumble of Words; but
to such (of whom there are not a few) who have enjoyed that State with
the Sentiments proper for it, you will have every Line, which hits the
Sorrow, attended with a Tear of Pity and Consolation. For I know not
by what Goodness of Providence it is, that every Gush of Passion is a
step towards the Relief of it; and there is a certain <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec520.txt')">Comfort</a> in the
very Act of Sorrowing, which, I suppose, arises from a secret
Consciousness in the Mind, that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec520.txt')">Affliction</a> it is under flows from
a virtuous Cause. My Concern is not indeed so outragious as at the
first Transport; for I think it has subsided rather into a soberer
State of Mind, than any actual Perturbation of Spirit. There might be
Rules formed for Men's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec520.txt')">Behaviour</a> on this great Incident, to bring them
from that Misfortune into the Condition I am at present; which is, I
think, that my Sorrow has converted all Roughness of Temper into
Meekness, Good-nature, and Complacency: But indeed, when in a serious
and lonely Hour I present my departed Consort to my Imagination, with
that Air of Perswasion in her Countenance when I have been in Passion,
that sweet Affability when I have been in good Humour, that tender
Compassion when I have had any thing which gave me Uneasiness; I
confess to you I am inconsolable, and my Eyes gush with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec520.txt')">Grief</a> as if I
had seen her but just then expire. In this Condition I am broken in
upon by a charming young Woman, my Daughter, who is the Picture of
what her Mother was on her Wedding-Day. The good Girl strives to
comfort me; but how shall I let you know that all the Comfort she
gives me is to make my Tears flow more easily? The Child knows she
quickens my Sorrows, and rejoices my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec520.txt')">Heart</a> at the same Time. Oh, ye
Learned! tell me by what <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec520.txt')">Word</a> to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec520.txt')">speak</a> a Motion of the Soul, for which
there is no name. When she kneels and bids me be comforted, she is my
Child; when I take her in my Arms, and bid her say no more, she is my
very Wife, and is the very Comforter I lament the Loss of. I banish
her the Room, and weep aloud that I have lost her Mother, and that I
have her.</p><p>'_Mr._ SPECTATOR, I wish it were possible for you to have a Sense of
these pleasing Perplexities; you might communicate to the guilty part
of Mankind, that they are incapable of the Happiness which is in the
very Sorrows of the Virtuous.</p><p>'But pray spare me a little longer; give me Leave to tell you the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec520.txt')">Manner</a> of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec520.txt')">Death</a>. She took leave of all her Family, and bore the
vain Application of Medicines with the greatest Patience imaginable.
When the Physician told her she must certainly die, she desired, as
well as she could, that all who were present, except my self, might
depart the Room. She said she had nothing to say, for she was
resigned, and I knew all she knew that concerned us in this World; but
she desired to be alone, that in the presence of God only she might,
without Interruption, do her last Duty to me, of thanking me for all
my Kindness to her; adding, that she hoped in my last Moments I should
feel the same Comfort for my Goodness to her, as she did in that she
had acquitted herself with Honour, Truth and Virtue to me.</p><p>'I curb my self, and will not tell you that this Kindness cut my Heart
in twain, when I expected an Accusation for some passionate Starts of
mine, in some Parts of our Time together, to say nothing, but thank me
for the Good, if there was any Good suitable to her own Excellence!
All that I had ever said to her, all the Circumstances of Sorrow and
Joy between us, crowded upon my Mind in the same Instant; and when
immediately after I saw the Pangs of Death come upon that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec520.txt')">dear</a> Body
which I had often embraced with Transport, when I saw those cherishing
Eyes begin to be ghastly, and their last Struggle to be to fix
themselves on me, how did I lose all patience? She expired in my Arms,
and in my Distraction I thought I saw her Bosom still heave. There was
certainly Life yet still left; I cried she just now spoke to me: But
alas! I grew giddy, and all things moved about me from the Distemper
of my own Head; for the best of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec520.txt')">Women</a> was breathless, and gone for
ever.</p><p>'Now the Doctrine I would, methinks, have you raise from this Account
I have given you is, That there is a certain Equanimity in those who
are good and just, which runs into their very Sorrow, and disappoints
the Force of it. Though they must pass through Afflictions in common
with all who are in human Nature, yet their conscious Integrity shall
undermine their Affliction; nay, that very Affliction shall add Force
to their Integrity, from a Reflection of the Use of Virtue in the Hour
of Affliction. I sat down with a Design to put you upon giving us
Rules how to overcome such Griefs as these, but I should rather advise
you to teach Men to be capable of them.</p><p>'You Men of Letters have what you <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec520.txt')">call</a> the fine Taste in their
Apprehensions of what is properly done or said: There is something
like this deeply grafted in the Soul of him who is honest and faithful
in all his Thoughts and Actions. Every thing which is false, vicious
or unworthy, is despicable to him, though all the World should approve
it. At the same time he has the most lively Sensibility in all
Enjoyments and Sufferings which it is proper for him to have, where
any Duty of Life is concerned. To want Sorrow when you in Decency and
Truth should be afflicted, is, I should think, a greater Instance of a
Man's being a Blockhead, than not to know the Beauty of any Passage in
_Virgil_. You have not yet observed, _Mr._ SPECTATOR, that the fine
Gentlemen of this Age set up for Hardness of Heart, and Humanity has
very little share in their Pretences. He is a brave Fellow who is
always ready to kill a Man he hates, but he does not stand in the same
Degree of Esteem who laments for the Woman he loves. I should fancy
you might work up a thousand pretty Thoughts, by reflecting upon the
Persons most susceptible of the sort of Sorrow I have spoken of; and I
dare say you will find upon Examination, that they are the wisest and
the bravest of Mankind who are most capable of it.</p><p>_I am,</p><p>SIR,</p><p>Your most humble Servant,</p><p>F. J.</p><p>Norwich,</p><p>7Â° Octobris,</p><p>1712.</p><p>
