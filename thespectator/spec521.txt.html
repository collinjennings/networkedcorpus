<p>No. 521.               Tuesday, October 28, 1712.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Vera redit facies, dissimulata perit.'</p><p>P. Arb.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>I have been for many Years loud in this Assertion, That there are very
few that can see or hear, I mean that can report what they have seen
or heard; and this thro' Incapacity or Prejudice, one of which
disables almost every Man who talks to you from representing <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec521.txt')">things</a> as
he ought. For which Reason I am come to a Resolution of believing
nothing I hear; and I contemn the Men given to Narration under the
Appellation of a Matter of Fact Man: And according to me, a Matter of
Fact Man is one whose Life and <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec521.txt')">Conversation</a> is spent in the Report of
what is not Matter of Fact.</p><p>I remember when Prince _Eugene_ was here, there was no knowing his
Height or Figure, till you, _Mr._ SPECTATOR, gave the Publick
Satisfaction in that Matter. In Relations, the Force of the Expression
lies very often more in the Look, the Tone of Voice, or the Gesture,
than the Words themselves; which being repeated in any other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec521.txt')">Manner</a> by
the Undiscerning, bear a very different Interpretation from their
original Meaning. I must confess, I formerly have turn'd this Humour
of mine to very good Account; for whenever I heard any Narration
utter'd with extraordinary vehemence, and grounded upon considerable
Authority, I was always ready to lay any Wager that it was not so.
Indeed I never pretended to be so rash, as to fix the Matter in any
particular Way in Opposition to theirs; but as there are a hundred
Ways of any thing happening, besides that it has happen'd, I only
controverted its falling out in that one Manner as they settled it,
and left it to the Ninety nine other Ways, and consequently had more
Probability of Success. I had arrived at a particular skill in warming
a Man so far in his Narration, as to make him throw in a little of the
Marvelous, and then, if he has much Fire, the next Degree is the
Impossible. Now this is always the Time for fixing the Wager. But this
requires the nicest Management, otherwise very probably the Dispute
may arise to the old Determination by Battle. In these Conceits I have
been very fortunate, and have won some Wagers of those who have
professedly valued themselves upon Intelligence, and have put
themselves to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec521.txt')">great</a> Charge and Expence to be misinformed considerably
sooner than the Rest of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec521.txt')">World</a>.</p><p>Having got a comfortable Sum by this my Opposition to publick Report,
I have brought my self now to so great a Perfection in Inattention,
more especially to <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec521.txt')">Party</a> Relations, that at the same time I seem with
greedy Ears to devour up the Discourse, I certainly don't know one
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec521.txt')">Word</a> of it, but pursue my own Course of Thought, whether upon Business
or Amusement, with much Tranquility: I say Inattention, because a late
Act of Parliament has secur'd all Party-Lyars from the Penalty of a
Wager, [1] and consequently made it unprofitable to attend them.
However, good Breeding obliges a Man to maintain the Figure of the
keenest Attention, the true Posture of which in a Coffee-house I take
to consist in leaning over a Table, with the Edge of it pressing hard
upon your Stomach; for the more Pain the Narration is received with,
the more gracious is your bending over: Besides that the Narrator
thinks you forget your Pain by the Pleasure of hearing him.</p><p>Fort _Knock_ has occasioned several very perplexed and inelegant Heats
and Animosities; and there was one t'other day in a Coffee-house where
I was, that took upon him to clear that Business to me, for he said he
was there. I knew him to be that sort of Man that had not strength of
Capacity to be inform'd of any thing that depended merely upon his
being an Eye-Witness, and therefore was fully satisfied he could give
me no Information, for the very same Reason he believed he could, for
he was there. However, I heard him with the same Greediness as
_Shakespear_ describes in the following Lines:</p><p>'I saw a Smith stand on his Hammer, thus,
With open Mouth swallowing a Taylor's News.'</p><p>I confess of late I have not been so much amazed at the Declaimers in
Coffee-houses as I formerly was, being satisfied that they expect to
be rewarded for their Vociferations. Of these Liars there are two
Sorts. The Genius of the first consists in much Impudence and a strong
Memory; the others have added to these Qualifications a good
Understanding and smooth Language. These therefore have only certain
Heads, which they are as eloquent upon as they can, and may be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec521.txt')">call</a>'d
Embellishers; the others repeat only what they hear from others as
literally as their Parts or Zeal will permit, and are called Reciters.
Here was a Fellow in Town some Years ago, who used to divert himself
by telling a Lie at _Charing-Cross_ in the Morning at eight of [the]
Clock, and then following it through all Parts of the Town till eight
at Night; at which time he came to a Club of his Friends, and diverted
them with an Account what Censure it had at _Will's_ in
_Covent-Garden_, how dangerous it was believed to be at _Child's_, and
what Inference they drew from it with Relation to Stocks at
_Jonathan's_. I have had the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec521.txt')">Honour</a> to travel with this Gentleman I
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec521.txt')">speak</a> of in Search of one of his Falshoods; and have been present when
they have described the very Man they have spoken to, as him who first
reported it, tall or short, black or fair, a Gentleman or a
Raggamuffin, according as they liked the Intelligence. I have heard
one of our ingenious Writers of News say, that when he has had a
Customer come with an Advertisement of an Apprentice or a Wife run
away, he has desired the Advertiser to compose himself a little,
before he dictated the Description of the Offender: For when a Person
is put into a publick Paper by a Man who is angry with him, the real
Description of such Person is hid in the Deformity with which the
angry Man described him; therefore this Fellow always made his
Customers describe him as he would the Day before he offended, or else
he was sure he would never find him out. These and many other Hints I
could suggest to you for the Elucidation of all Fictions; but I leave
it to your own Sagacity to improve or neglect this Speculation.</p><p>_I am, SIR,</p><p>Your most obedient,</p><p>Humble Servant._</p><p></p><p>Postscript _to the_ Spectator, _Number 502_.</p><p>N. B. _There are in the Play of the_ Self-Tormentor _of_ Terence's,
_which is allowed a most excellent Comedy, several Incidents which would
draw Tears from any Man of Sense, and not one which would move his
Laughter._</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: By 7 Anne, cap. 17, all wagers laid upon a contingency
relating to the war with France were declared void.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
