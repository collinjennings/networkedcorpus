<p>No. 522.                Wednesday, October 29, 1712.             Steele.</p><p></p><p>'--Adjuro nunquam eam me deserturum,
Non, si capiundos mihi sciam esse inimicos omneis homines.
Hanc mihi expetivi, contigit: conveniunt mores: valeant
Qui inter nos dissidium volunt: hanc, nisi mors,
Mi adimet nemo.'</p><p>Ter.</p><p></p><p>I should esteem my self a very happy Man, if my Speculations could in
the least contribute to the rectifying the Conduct of my Readers in one
of the most important Affairs of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec522.txt')">Life</a>, to wit their Choice in <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec522.txt')">Marriage</a>.
This State is the Foundation of Community, and the chief Band of
Society; and I do not think I can be too frequent on Subjects which may
give Light to my unmarried Readers, in a particular which is so
essential to their following Happiness or Misery. A virtuous
Disposition, a good Understanding, an <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec522.txt')">agreeable</a> Person, and an easy
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec522.txt')">Fortune</a>, are the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec522.txt')">things</a> which should be chiefly regarded on this
Occasion. Because my present View is to direct a young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec522.txt')">Lady</a>, who, I
think, is now in doubt whom to take of many Lovers, I shall talk at this
time to my female Reader. The Advantages, as I was going to say, of
Sense, Beauty and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec522.txt')">Riches</a>, are what are certainly the chief Motives to a
prudent young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec522.txt')">Woman</a> of Fortune for changing her Condition; but as she is
to have her Eye upon each of these, she is to ask herself whether the
Man who has most of these Recommendations in the Lump is not the most
desirable. He that has excellent Talents, with a moderate <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec522.txt')">Estate</a>, and an
agreeable Person, is preferable to him who is only <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec522.txt')">rich</a>, if it were only
that good Faculties may purchase Riches, but Riches cannot purchase
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec522.txt')">worthy</a> Endowments. I do not mean that Wit, and a Capacity to entertain,
is what should be highly valued, except it is founded upon Good-nature
and Humanity. There are many ingenious Men, whose Abilities do little
else but make themselves and those about them uneasy: Such are those who
are far gone in the Pleasures of the Town, who cannot support Life
without quick Sensations and gay Reflections, and are Strangers to
Tranquility, to right Reason, and a calm Motion of Spirits without
Transport or Dejection. These ingenious Men, of all Men living, are most
to be avoided by her who would be happy in [a [1]] <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec522.txt')">Husband</a>. They are
immediately sated with Possession, and must necessarily fly to new
Acquisitions of Beauty, to pass away the whiling Moments and Intervals
of Life; for with them every Hour is heavy that is not joyful. But there
is a sort of Man of Wit and Sense, that can reflect upon his own Make,
and that of his Partner, with the Eyes of Reason and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec522.txt')">Honour</a>, and who
believes he offends against both these, if he does not look upon the
Woman (who chose him to be under his Protection in Sickness and Health)
with the utmost Gratitude, whether from that Moment she is shining or
defective in Person or Mind: I say, there are those who think themselves
bound to supply with Good-nature the Failings of those who <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec522.txt')">love</a> them,
and who always think those the Objects of Love and Pity, who came to
their Arms the Objects of Joy and Admiration.</p><p>Of this latter sort is _Lysander_, a Man of Wit, Learning, Sobriety and
Good-nature, of Birth and Estate below no Woman to accept, and of whom
it might be said, should he succeed in his present Wishes, his Mistress
rais'd his Fortune, but not that she made it. When a Woman is
deliberating with herself whom she shall chuse of many near each other
in other Pretensions, certainly he of best Understanding is to be
preferr'd. Life hangs heavily in the repeated <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec522.txt')">Conversation</a> of one who
has no Imagination to be fired at the several Occasions and Objects
which come before him, or who cannot Strike out of his Reflections new
Paths of pleasing Discourse. Honest _Will Thrash_ and his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec522.txt')">Wife</a>, tho' not
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec522.txt')">married</a> above four Months, have scarce had a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec522.txt')">Word</a> to say to each other
this six weeks; and one cannot form to one's self a sillier Picture,
than these two Creatures in solemn Pomp and Plenty unable to enjoy their
Fortunes, and at a full stop among a Crowd of Servants, to whose Taste
of Life they are beholden for the little Satisfactions by which they can
be understood to be so much as barely in Being. The Hours of the Day,
the Distinctions of Noon and Night, Dinner and Supper, are the greatest
Notices they are capable of. This is perhaps representing the Life of a
very modest Woman, joined to a dull Fellow, more insipid than it really
deserves; but I am sure it is not to exalt the Commerce with an
ingenious Companion too high, to say that every new Accident or Object
which comes into such a Gentleman's way, gives his Wife new Pleasures
and Satisfactions. The Approbation of his Words and Actions is a
continual new Feast to her, nor can she enough applaud her good Fortune
in having her Life varied every hour, her Mind more improv'd, and her
Heart more glad from every Circumstance which they meet with. He will
lay out his Invention in forming new Pleasures and Amusements, and make
the Fortune she has brought him subservient to the Honour and Reputation
of her and hers. A Man of Sense who is thus oblig'd, is ever contriving
the Happiness of her who did him so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec522.txt')">great</a> a Distinction; while the Fool
is ungrateful without Vice, and never returns a Favour because he is not
sensible of it. I would, methinks, have so much to say for my self, that
if I fell into the hands of him who treated me ill, he should be
sensible when he did so: His Conscience should be of my side, whatever
became of his Inclination. I do not know but it is the insipid Choice
which has been made by those who have the Care of young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec522.txt')">Women</a>, that the
Marriage State it self has been liable to so much Ridicule. But a
well-chosen Love, mov'd by Passion on both sides, and perfected by the
Generosity of one Party, must be adorn'd with so many handsome Incidents
on the other side, that every particular Couple would be an example in
many Circumstances to all the rest of the Species. I shall end the Chat
upon this Subject with a couple of Letters, one from a Lover who is very
well acquainted with the way of Bargaining on these Occasions; and the
other from his Rival, who has a less Estate, but great Gallantry of
Temper. As for my Man of Prudence, he makes love, as he says, as if he
were already a Father, and laying aside the Passion, comes to the Reason
of the Thing.</p><p>
_Madam,_</p><p>My Counsel [2] has perused the Inventory of your Estate, and
consider'd what Estate you have, which it seems is only yours, and to
the Male-Heirs of your Body; but, in Default of such Issue, to the
right Heirs of your Uncle _Edward_ for ever. Thus, Madam, I am advis'd
you cannot (the Remainder not being in you) dock the Entail; by which
means my Estate, which is Fee-Simple, will come by the Settlement
propos'd to your Children begotten by me, whether they are Males or
Females; but my Children begotten upon you will not inherit your
Lands, except I beget a Son. Now, Madam, since things are so, you are
a Woman of that Prudence, and understand the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec522.txt')">World</a> so well, as not to
expect I should give you more than you can give me.</p><p>_I am, Madam,</p><p>(with great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec522.txt')">Respect</a>)</p><p>Your most obedient humble Servant,_ T. W.</p><p></p><p>The other Lover's Estate is less than this Gentleman's, but he express'd
himself as follows.</p><p>
_Madam,_</p><p>I have given in my Estate to your Counsel, [3] and desired my own
Lawyer to insist upon no Terms which your Friends can propose for your
certain Ease and Advantage: For indeed I have no notion of making
Difficulties of presenting you with what cannot make me happy without
you.</p><p>_I am, Madam,</p><p>Your most devoted humble Servant,_ B. T.</p><p>
You must know the Relations have met upon this, and the Girl being
mightily taken with the latter Epistle, she is laugh'd out, and Uncle
_Edward_ is to be dealt with to make her a suitable Match to the worthy
Gentleman who has told her he does not care a farthing for her. All I
hope for is, that the Lady _Fair_ will make use of the first light Night
to show _B. T._ she understands a Marriage is not to be considered as a
common Bargain.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [an] and in first reprint.]</p><p>
