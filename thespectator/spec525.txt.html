<p>No. 525.              Saturday, November 1, 1712.           John Hughes.</p><p></p><p>[Greek: Hod' eís tò sôphron ep' aretàen t' ágôn érôs,
Zaelôtos ánthrôpoisin]</p><p>Eurip.</p><p></p><p>It is my Custom to take [frequent] Opportunities of enquiring from time
to time, what Success my Speculations meet with in the Town. I am glad
to find in particular, that my Discourses on <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec525.txt')">Marriage</a> have been well
received. A <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec525.txt')">Friend</a> of mine gives me to understand, from
_Doctors-Commons_, that more Licences have been taken out there of late
than usual. I am likewise informed of several pretty Fellows, who have
resolved to commence Heads of Families by the first favourable
Opportunity: One of them writes me <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec525.txt')">word</a>, that he is ready to enter into
the Bonds of Matrimony, provided I will give it him under my Hand (as I
now do) that a Man may shew his Face in good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec525.txt')">Company</a> after he is
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec525.txt')">married</a>, and that he need not be ashamed to treat a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec525.txt')">Woman</a> with Kindness,
who puts herself into his Power for Life.</p><p>I have other Letters on this Subject, which say that I am attempting to
make a Revolution in the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec525.txt')">World</a> of Gallantry, and that the Consequence of
it will be, that a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec525.txt')">great</a> deal of the sprightliest <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec525.txt')">Wit</a> and Satyr of the
last Age will be lost. That a bashful Fellow, upon changing his
Condition, will be no longer puzzled how to stand the Raillery of his
facetious Companions; that he need not own he married only to plunder an
Heiress of her Fortune, nor pretend that he uses her ill, to avoid the
[ridiculous [1]] Name of a fond <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec525.txt')">Husband</a>.</p><p>Indeed if I may <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec525.txt')">speak</a> my Opinion of great part of the Writings which
once prevail'd among us under the Notion of Humour, they are such as
would tempt one to think there had been an Association among the Wits of
those times to rally Legitimacy out of our Island. A State of Wedlock
was the common Mark for all the Adventurers in Farce and Comedy, as well
as the Essayers in Lampoon and Satyr, to shoot at, and nothing was a
more standing Jest in all Clubs of fashionable Mirth, and gay
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec525.txt')">Conversation</a>. It was determined among those airy Criticks, that the
Appellation of a _Sober Man_ should signify a _Spiritless Fellow_. And I
am apt to think it was about the same Time, that _Good-Nature_, a Word
so peculiarly elegant in our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec525.txt')">Language</a> that some have affirmed it cannot
well be expressed in any other, came first to be render'd suspicious,
and in danger of being transferred from its original Sense to so distant
an Idea as that of _Folly_.</p><p>I must confess it has been my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec525.txt')">Ambition</a>, in the course of my Writings, to
restore, as well as I was able, the proper Ideas of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec525.txt')">things</a>. And as I
have attempted this already on the Subject of Marriage, in several
Papers, I shall here add some further Observations which occur to me on
the same Head. Nothing seems to be thought, by our fine Gentlemen, so
indispensable an Ornament in fashionable Life, as <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec525.txt')">Love</a>. _A Knight
Errant_, says _Don Quixot, without a Mistress, is like a Tree without
Leaves;_ and a Man of Mode among us, who has not some Fair One to sigh
for, might as well pretend to appear dressed, without his Periwig. We
have Lovers in Prose innumerable. All our Pretenders to Rhyme are
professed Inamorato's; and there is scarce a Poet, good or bad, to be
heard of, who has not some real or supposed _Sacharissa_ to improve his
Vein.</p><p>If Love be any Refinement, _Conjugal Love_ must be certainly so in a
much higher Degree. There is no comparison between the frivolous
Affectation of attracting the Eyes of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec525.txt')">Women</a> with whom you are only
captivated by Way of Amusement, and of whom perhaps you know nothing
more than their Features, and a regular and uniform Endeavour to make
your self valuable, both as a Friend and Lover, to one whom you have
chosen to be the Companion of your Life. The first is the Spring of a
thousand Fopperies, silly Artifices, Falshoods, and perhaps Barbarities;
or at best arises no higher than to a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec525.txt')">kind</a> of Dancing-School Breeding,
to give the Person a more sparkling Air. The latter is the Parent of
substantial Virtues and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec525.txt')">agreeable</a> Qualities, and cultivates the Mind
while it improves the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec525.txt')">Behaviour</a>. The Passion of Love to a Mistress, even
where it is most sincere, resembles too much the Flame of a Fever; that
to a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec525.txt')">Wife</a> is like the Vital Heat.</p><p>I have often thought, if the Letters written by Men of Goodnature to
their Wives, were to be compared with those written by Men of Gallantry
to their Mistresses, the former, notwithstanding any Inequality of
Style, would appear to have the Advantage. Friendship, Tenderness and
Constancy, drest in a Simplicity of Expression, recommend themselves by
a more native Elegance, than passionate Raptures, extravagant Encomiums,
and slavish Adoration. If we were admitted to search the Cabinet of the
beautiful _Narcissa_, among Heaps of Epistles from several Admirers,
which are there preserv'd with equal Care, how few should we find but
would make any one Sick in the Reading, except her who is flattered by
them? But in how different a Style must the wise _Benevolus_, who
converses with that good Sense and good Humour among all his Friends,
write to a Wife who is the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec525.txt')">worthy</a> Object of his utmost Affection?
_Benevolus_, both in Publick and Private, on all Occasions of Life,
appears to have every good Quality and desirable Ornament. Abroad he is
reverenced and esteemed; at home beloved and happy. The Satisfaction he
enjoys there, settles into an habitual Complacency, which shines in his
Countenance, enlivens his Wit, and seasons his Conversation: Even those
of his Acquaintance, who have never seen him in his Retirement, are
Sharers in the Happiness of it; and it is very much owing to his being
the best and best beloved of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec525.txt')">Husbands</a>, that he is the most stedfast of
Friends, and the most agreeable of Companions.</p><p>There is a sensible Pleasure in contemplating such beautiful Instances
of Domestick Life. The Happiness of the Conjugal State appears
heighten'd to the highest degree it is capable of, when we see two
Persons of accomplished Minds, not only united in the same Interests and
Affections, but in their Taste of the same Improvements, Pleasures and
Diversions. _Pliny_, one of the finest Gentlemen, and politest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec525.txt')">Writers</a>
of the Age in which he lived, has left us, in his Letter to _Hispulla_,
his Wife's Aunt, one of the most agreeable Family-Pieces of this Kind I
have ever met with. I shall end this Discourse with a Translation of it;
and I believe the Reader will be of my opinion, that _Conjugal Love_ is
drawn in it with a Delicacy which makes it appear to be, as I have
represented it, an Ornament as well as a Virtue.</p><p>
PLINY _to_ HISPULLA. [2]</p><p>'As I remember the great Affection which was between you and your
excellent Brother, and know you love his Daughter as your own, so as
not only to express the Tenderness of the best of Aunts, but even to
supply that of the best of Fathers; I am sure it will be a pleasure to
you to hear that she proves worthy of her Father, worthy of you, and
of your Ancestors. Her Ingenuity is admirable; her Frugality
extraordinary. She loves me, the surest Pledge of her Virtue; and adds
to this a wonderful Disposition to Learning, which she has acquir'd
from her Affection to me. She reads my Writings, studies them, and
even gets them by heart. You'd smile to see the Concern she is in when
I have a Cause to plead, and the Joy she shews when it is over. She
finds means to have the first News brought her of the Success I meet
with in Court, how I am heard, and what Decree is made. If I recite
any thing in publick, she cannot refrain from placing her self
privately in some Corner to hear, where with the utmost delight she
feasts upon my Applauses. Sometimes she sings my Verses, and
accompanies them with the Lute, without any Master, except Love, the
best of Instructors. From these Instances I take the most certain
Omens of our perpetual and encreasing Happiness; since our Affection
is not founded on my Youth and Person, which must gradually decay, but
she is in love with the immortal Part of me, my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec525.txt')">Glory</a> and Reputation.
Nor indeed could less be expected from one who had the Happiness to
receive her Education from you, who in your House was accustomed to
every thing that was virtuous and decent, and even began to love me by
your Recommendation. For, as you had always the greatest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec525.txt')">Respect</a> for
my Mother, you were pleased from my Infancy to form me, to commend me,
and kindly to presage I should be one day what my Wife fancies I am.
Accept therefore our united Thanks; mine, that you have bestowed her
on me, and hers, that you have given me to her, as a mutual Grant of
Joy and Felicity.'</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [scandalous]]</p><p>
