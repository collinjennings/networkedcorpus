<p>No. 526.              Monday, November 3, 1712.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>'--Fortius utere Loris.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>I am very loth to come to Extremities with the young Gentlemen mention'd
in the following Letter, and do not care to chastise them with my own
Hand, till I am forc'd by Provocations too <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec526.txt')">great</a> to be suffer'd without
the absolute Destruction of my Spectatorial Dignity. The Crimes of these
Offenders are placed under the Observation of one of my chief Officers,
who is posted just at the entrance of the Pass between _London_ and
_Westminster_. As I have great Confidence in the Capacity, Resolution
and Integrity of the Person deputed by me to give an Account of
Enormities, I doubt not but I shall soon have before me all proper
Notices which are requisite for the Amendment of Manners in Publick, and
the Instruction of each Individual of the Human Species in what is due
from him, in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec526.txt')">respect</a> to the whole Body of Mankind. The present Paper
shall consist only of the above-mentioned Letter, and the Copy of a
Deputation which I have given to my trusty <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec526.txt')">Friend</a> Mr. _John Sly_;
wherein he is charged to notify to me all that is necessary for my
Animadversion upon the Delinquents mentioned by my Correspondent, as
well as all others described in the said Deputation.</p><p>
_To the_ SPECTATOR-GENERAL _of_ Great Britain.</p><p>'I grant it does look a little familiar, but I must <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec526.txt')">call</a> you</p><p>_Dear Dumb_,</p><p>'Being got again to the farther End of the _Widow's_ Coffeehouse, I
shall from hence give you some account of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec526.txt')">Behaviour</a> of our
Hackney-Coachmen since my last. These indefatigable Gentlemen, without
the least Design, I dare say, of Self-Interest or Advantage to
themselves, do still ply as Volunteers Day and Night for the Good of
their Country. I will not trouble you with enumerating many
Particulars, but I must by no means omit to inform you of an Infant
about six foot high, and between twenty and thirty Years of Age, who
was seen in the Arms of a Hackney Coach-man driving by _Will's_
Coffee-house in _Covent-Garden_, between the Hours of four and five in
the Afternoon of that very Day, wherein you publish'd a Memorial
against them. This impudent young Cur, tho' he could not sit in a
Coach-box without holding, yet would he venture his Neck to bid
defiance to your Spectatorial Authority, or to any thing that you
countenanced. Who he was I know not, but I heard this Relation this
Morning from a Gentleman who was an Eye-Witness of this his Impudence;
and I was willing to take the first opportunity to inform you of him,
as holding it extremely requisite that you should nip him in the Bud.
But I am my self most concerned for my Fellow-Templers,
Fellow-Students, and Fellow-Labourers in the Law, I mean such of them
as are dignified and distinguish'd under the Denomination of
Hackney-Coachmen. Such aspiring Minds have these ambitious young Men,
that they cannot enjoy themselves out of a Coach-Box. It is however an
unspeakable Comfort to me, that I can now tell you, that some of them
are grown so bashful as to study only in the Nighttime, or in the
Country. The other Night I spied one of our young Gentlemen very
diligent at his Lucubrations in _Fleet-Street_; and by the way, I
should be under some concern, lest this hard Student should one time
or other crack his Brain with studying, but that I am in hopes Nature
has taken care to fortify him in proportion to the great Undertakings
he was design'd for. Another of my Fellow-Templers, on _Thursday_
last, was getting up into his Study at the Bottom of _Grays-Inn-Lane_,
in order, I suppose, to contemplate in the fresh Air. Now, Sir, my
Request is, that the great Modesty of these two Gentlemen may be
recorded as a Pattern to the rest; and if you would but give them two
or three Touches with your own Pen, tho' you might not perhaps prevail
with them to desist entirely from their Meditations, yet I doubt not
but you would at least preserve them from being publick Spectacles of
Folly in our Streets. I say, two or three Touches with your own Pen;
for I have really observed, Mr. SPEC, that those _Spectators_ which
are so prettily laced down the sides with little c's, how instructive
soever they may be, do not carry with them that Authority as the
others. I do again therefore desire, that for the sake of their dear
Necks, you will bestow one Penful of your own Ink upon them. I know
you are loth to expose them; and it is, I must confess, a thousand
Pities that any young Gentleman, who is come of honest Parents, should
be brought to publick Shame: And indeed I should be glad to have them
handled a little tenderly at the first; but if fair means will not
prevail, there is then no other Way to reclaim them, but by making use
of some wholesome Severities; and I think it is better that a Dozen or
two of such good-for-nothing Fellows should be made Examples of, than
that the Reputation of some Hundreds of as hopeful young Gentlemen as
my self should suffer thro' their Folly. It is not, however, for me to
direct you what to do; but, in short, if our Coachmen will drive on
this Trade, the very first of them that I do find meditating in the
Street, I shall make Bold to take the Number of his Chambers, together
with a Note of his Name, and dispatch them to you, that you may
chastise him at your own Discretion.</p><p>I am, Dear SPEC.
For ever Yours,
Moses Greenbag,
Esq., if you please.</p><p>P. S. '_Tom Hammercloth_, one of our Coachmen, is now pleading at the
Bar at the other end of the Room, but has a little too much Vehemence,
and throws out his Arms too much to take his Audience with a good
Grace.</p><p>
_To my Loving and Well-beloved_ John Sly, _Haberdasher of Hats and
Tobacconist, between the Cities of_ London _and _Westminster.</p><p>Whereas frequent Disorders, Affronts, Indignities, Omissions, and
Trespasses, for which there are no Remedies by any Form of Law, but
which apparently disturb and disquiet the Minds of Men, happen near the
Place of your Residence; and that you are, as well by your commodious
Situation as the good Parts with which you are endowed, properly
qualified for the Observation of the said Offences; I do hereby
authorize and depute you from the hours of Nine in the Morning, till
Four in the Afternoon, to keep a strict Eye upon all Persons and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec526.txt')">Things</a>
that are convey'd in Coaches, carried in Carts, or walk on Foot from the
City of _London_ to the City of _Westminster_, or from the City of
_Westminster_ to the City of _London_, within the said Hours. You are
therefore not to depart from your Observatory at the end of
_Devereux-Court_ during the said space of each Day; but to observe the
Behaviour of all Persons who are suddenly transported from stamping on
Pebbles to sit at ease in Chariots, what Notice they take of their
Foot-Acquaintance, and send me the speediest Advice, when they are
guilty of overlooking, turning from, or appearing grave and distant to
their old Friends. When Man and Wife are in the same Coach, you are to
see whether they appear pleased or tired with each other, and whether
they carry the due Mein in the Eye of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec526.txt')">World</a> between Fondness and
Coldness. You are carefully to behold all such as shall have Addition of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec526.txt')">Honour</a> or Riches, and Report whether they preserve the Countenance they
had before such Addition. As to Persons on Foot, you are to be attentive
whether they are pleased with their Condition, and are dress'd suitable
to it; but especially to distinguish such as appear discreet, by a
low-heel Shoe, with the decent Ornament of a Leather-Garter: To write
down the Name of such Country Gentlemen as, upon the Approach of Peace,
have left the Hunting for the Military Cock of the Hat: Of all who
strut, make a Noise, and swear at the Drivers of Coaches to make haste,
when they see it impossible they should pass: Of all young Gentlemen in
Coach-boxes, who labour at a Perfection in what they are sure to be
excelled by the meanest of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec526.txt')">People</a>. You are to do all that in you
lies that Coaches and Passengers give way according to the Course of
Business, all the Morning in Term-Time towards _Westminster_, the rest
of the Year towards the _Exchange_. Upon these Directions, together with
other secret Articles herein inclosed, you are to govern your self, and
give Advertisement thereof to me at all convenient and spectatorial
Hours, when Men of Business are to be seen. Hereof you are not to fail.
Given under my Seal of Office.</p><p>_The_ SPECTATOR.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
