<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec527.txt')">married</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec527.txt')">Woman</a> is consulted in the first of the following Letters, and
the Felicity of a Maiden <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec527.txt')">Lady</a> in the second. I <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec527.txt')">call</a> it a Felicity to
have the Addresses of an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec527.txt')">agreeable</a> Man: and I think I have not any where
seen a prettier Application of a Poetical Story than that of his, in
making the Tale of _Cephalus_ and _Procris_ the History-Picture of a Fan
in so gallant a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec527.txt')">manner</a> as he addresses it. [1] But see the Letters.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Tis now almost three months since I was in Town about some Business;
and the Hurry of it being over, took Coach one Afternoon, and drove to
see a Relation, who married about six Years ago a wealthy Citizen. I
found her at home, but her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec527.txt')">Husband</a> gone to the _Exchange_, and
expected back within an Hour at the farthest. After the usual
Salutations of Kindness, and a hundred Questions about Friends in the
Country, we sat down to Piquet, played two or three Games, and drank
Tea. I should have told you that this was my second time of seeing her
since <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec527.txt')">Marriage</a>, but before she lived at the same Town where I went to
School; so that the Plea of a Relation, added to the Innocence of my
Youth, prevailed upon her good Humour to indulge me in a Freedom of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec527.txt')">Conversation</a> as often, and oftner, than the strict Discipline of the
School would allow of. You may easily imagine after such an
Acquaintance we might be exceeding merry without any Offence, as in
calling to mind how many Inventions I had been put to in deluding the
Master, how many Hands forged for Excuses, how many times been sick in
perfect Health; for I was then never sick but at School, and only then
because out of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec527.txt')">Company</a>. We had whiled away three Hours after this
manner, when I found it past Five; and not expecting her Husband would
return till late, rose up, told her I should go early next Morning for
the Country: She kindly answered she was afraid it would be long
before she saw me again; so I took my leave and parted. Now, Sir, I
had not been got home a Fortnight, when I received a Letter from a
Neighbour of theirs, that ever since that fatal Afternoon the Lady had
been most inhumanly treated, and the Husband publickly stormed that he
was made a Member of too numerous a Society. He had, it seems,
listened most of the time my Cousin and I were together. As jealous
Ears always hear double, so he heard enough to make him mad; and as
jealous Eyes always see thro' Magnifying Glasses, so he was certain it
could not be I whom he had seen, a beardless Stripling, but fancied he
saw a gay Gentleman of the _Temple_, ten Years older than my self; and
for that reason, I presume, durst not come in, nor take any Notice
when I went out. He is perpetually asking his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec527.txt')">Wife</a> if she does not
think the time long (as she said she should) till she see her Cousin
again. Pray, Sir, what can be done in this Case? I have writ to him to
assure him I was at his House all that afternoon expecting to see him:
His Answer is, 'tis only a Trick of hers, and that he neither can nor
will believe me. The parting Kiss I find mightily nettles him, and
confirms him in all his Errors. _Ben. Johnson_, as I remember, makes a
Foreigner in one of his Comedies, _admire the desperate Valour of the
bold_ English, _who let out their Wives to all Encounters_. The
general Custom of Salutation should Excuse the Favour done me, or you
should lay down Rules when such Distinctions are to be given or
omitted. You cannot imagine, Sir, how troubled I am for this unhappy
Lady's Misfortune; and beg you would insert this Letter, that the
Husband may reflect upon this Accident coolly. It is no small Matter,
the Ease of a virtuous Woman for her whole Life: I know she will
conform to any Regularities (tho' more strict than the common Rules of
our Country require) to which his particular Temper shall incline him
to oblige her. This Accident puts me in mind how generously
_Pisistratus_ the _Athenian_ Tyrant behaved himself on a like
Occasion, when he was instigated by his Wife to put to death a young
Gentleman, because being passionately fond of his Daughter, he kissed
her in publick as he met her in the Street; _What_ (says he) _shall we
do to those who are our Enemies, if we do thus to those who are our
Friends_? I will not trouble you much longer, but am exceedingly
concern'd lest this Accident may cause a virtuous Lady to lead a
miserable Life with a Husband, who has no Grounds for his Jealousy but
what I have faithfully related, and ought to be reckon'd none. 'Tis to
be fear'd too, if at last he sees his Mistake, yet <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec527.txt')">People</a> will be as
slow and unwilling in disbelieving Scandal as they are quick and
forward in believing it. I shall endeavour to enliven this plain
honest Letter, with _Ovid's_ Relation about _Cybele's_ Image. The Ship
wherein it was aboard was stranded at the mouth of the _Tyber_, and
the Men were unable to move it, till _Claudia_, a Virgin, but
suspected of Unchastity, by a slight Pull hawled it in. The Story is
told in the fourth Book of the _Fasti_.</p><p>'Parent of Gods, began the weeping Fair,
Reward or punish, but oh! hear my Pray'r.
If Lewdness e'er defil'd my Virgin Bloom,
From Heav'n with Justice I receive my Doom;
But if my Honour yet has known no Stain,
Thou, Goddess, thou my Innocence maintain;
Thou, whom the nicest Rules of Goodness sway'd,
Vouchsafe to follow an unblemish'd Maid.
She spoke, and touch'd the Cord with glad Surprize,
(The truth was witness'd by ten thousand Eyes)
The pitying Goddess easily comply'd,
Follow'd in triumph, and adorn'd her Guide;
While_ Claudia, _blushing still far past Disgrace,
March'd silent on with a slow solemn Pace:
Nor yet from some was all Distrust remov'd,
Tho' Heav'n such Virtue by such Wonders prov'd.'</p><p>
I am, Sir,
Your very humble Servant,
_Philagnotes_.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'You will oblige a languishing Lover, if you will please to print the
enclosed Verses in your next Paper. If you remember the
_Metamorphosis_, you know _Procris_, the fond Wife of _Cephalus_, is
said to have made her Husband, who delighted in the Sports of the
Wood, a Present of an unerring Javelin. In process of time he was so
much in the Forest, that his Lady suspected he was pursuing some
Nymph, under the pretence of following a Chace more innocent. Under
this Suspicion she hid herself among the Trees, to observe his
Motions. While she lay conceal'd, her Husband, tired with the Labour
of Hunting, came within her hearing. As he was fainting with Heat, he
cried out, _Aura veni; Oh charming Air approach_.</p><p>'The unfortunate Wife, taking the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec527.txt')">Word</a> _Air_ to be the name of a
Woman, began to move among the Bushes; and the Husband believing it a
Deer, threw his Javelin and kill'd her. This History painted on a Fan,
which I presented to a Lady, gave occasion to my growing poetical.</p><p>
'Come gentle Air! th'_ Ã†olian _Shepherd said,
While_ Procris _panted in the secret Shade;
Come gentle Air! the fairer_ Delia _cries,
While at her Feet her Swain expiring lies.
Lo the glad Gales o'er all her Beauties stray,
Breathe on her Lips, and in her Bosom play.
In_ Delia's _Hand this Toy is fatal found,
Nor did that fabled Dart more surely wound.
Both Gifts destructive to the Givers prove,
Alike both Lovers fall by those they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec527.txt')">love</a>:
Yet guiltless too this bright Destroyer lives,
At random wounds, nor knows the Wound she gives.
She views the Story with attentive Eyes,
And pities_ Procris, _while her Lover dies.'</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: This second letter and the verses were from Pope.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
