<p>No. 528.            Wednesday, November 5, 1712.                 Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Dum potuit solite gemitum virtute repressit.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I who now write to you, am a <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec528.txt')">Woman</a> loaded with Injuries, and the
Aggravation of my Misfortune is, that they are such which are
overlooked by the Generality of Mankind, and tho' the most afflicting
imaginable, not regarded as such in the general Sense of the World. I
have hid my Vexation from all Mankind; but have now taken Pen, Ink,
and Paper, and am resolv'd to unbosom my self to you, and lay before
you what grieves me and all the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec528.txt')">Sex</a>. You have very often mentioned
particular Hardships done to this or that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec528.txt')">Lady</a>; but, methinks, you
have not in any one Speculation directly pointed at the partial
Freedom Men take, the unreasonable Confinement <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec528.txt')">Women</a> are obliged to,
in the only Circumstance in which we are necessarily to have a
Commerce with them, that of <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec528.txt')">Love</a>. The Case of Celibacy is the great
Evil of our Nation; and the Indulgence of the <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec528.txt')">vicious</a> Conduct of Men
in that State, with the Ridicule to which Women are exposed, though
ever so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec528.txt')">virtuous</a>, if long unmarried, is the Root of the greatest
Irregularities of this Nation. To shew you, Sir, that tho' you never
have given us the Catalogue of a Lady's Library as you promised, we
read good Books of our own chusing, I shall insert on this occasion a
Paragraph or two out of _Echard's Roman History_. In the 44th Page of
the second Volume the Author observes, that _Augustus_, upon his
Return to _Rome_ at the end of a War, received Complaints that too
great a Number of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec528.txt')">young</a> Men of Quality were unmarried. The Emperor
thereupon assembled the whole _Equestrian_ Order; and having separated
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec528.txt')">Married</a> from the Single, did particular Honours to the former, but
he told the latter, that is to say, Mr. SPECTATOR, he told the
Batchelors,</p><p>"That their Lives and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec528.txt')">Actions</a> had been so peculiar, that he knew not
by what Name to <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec528.txt')">call</a> 'em; not by that of Men, for they performed
nothing that was manly; not by that of Citizens, for the City might
perish notwithstanding their Care; nor by that of _Romans_, for they
designed to extirpate the _Roman_ Name."</p><p>Then proceeding to shew his tender Care and hearty Affection for his
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec528.txt')">People</a>, he further told them,</p><p>"That their Course of Life was of such pernicious Consequence to the
Glory and Grandeur of the _Roman_ Nation, that he could not chuse
but tell them, that all other Crimes put together could not equalize
theirs: For they were guilty of Murder, in not suffering those to be
born which should proceed from them; of Impiety, in causing the
Names and Honours of their Ancestors to cease; and of Sacrilege, in
destroying their Kind, which proceeded from the immortal Gods, and
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec528.txt')">Human</a> Nature, the principal thing consecrated to 'em: Therefore in
this Respect they dissolved the Government, in disobeying its Laws;
betrayed their Country, by making it barren and waste; nay and
demolished their City, in depriving it of Inhabitants. And he was
sensible that all this proceeded not from any kind of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec528.txt')">Virtue</a> or
Abstinence, but from a Looseness and Wantonness, which ought never
to be encouraged in any Civil Government."</p><p>There are no Particulars dwelt upon that let us into the Conduct of
these young Worthies, whom this great Emperor treated with so much
Justice and Indignation; but any one who observes what passes in this
Town, may very well frame to himself a Notion of their Riots and
Debaucheries all Night, and their apparent Preparations for them all
Day. It is not to be doubted but these _Romans_ never passed any of
their Time innocently but when they were asleep, and never slept but
when they were weary and heavy with Excesses, and slept only to
prepare themselves for the Repetition of them. If you did your Duty as
a SPECTATOR, you would carefully examine into the Number of Births,
Marriages, and Burials; and when you had deducted out of your Deaths
all such as went out of the World without marrying, then cast up the
number of both Sexes born within such a Term of Years last past, you
might from the single People departed make some useful Inferences or
Guesses how many there are left unmarried, and raise some useful
Scheme for the Amendment of the Age in that particular. I have not
Patience to proceed gravely on this abominable Libertinism; for I
cannot but reflect, as I am writing to you, upon a certain lascivious
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec528.txt')">Manner</a> which all our young Gentlemen use in publick, and examine our
Eyes with a Petulancy in their own, which is a downright Affront to
Modesty. A disdainful Look on such an Occasion is return'd with a
Countenance rebuked, but by averting their Eyes from the Woman of
Honour and Decency to some flippant Creature, who will, as the Phrase
is, be kinder. I must set down things as they come into my Head,
without standing upon Order. Ten thousand to one but the gay Gentleman
who stared, at the same time is an House-keeper; for you must know
they have got into a Humour of late of being very regular in their
Sins, and a young Fellow shall keep his four Maids and three Footmen
with the greatest Gravity imaginable. There are no less than six of
these venerable House-keepers of my Acquaintance. This Humour among
young Men of Condition is imitated by all the World below them, and a
general Dissolution of Manners arises from the one Source of
Libertinism, without Shame or Reprehension in the Male Youth. It is
from this one Fountain that so many Beautiful helpless young Women are
sacrific'd and given up to Lewdness, Shame, Poverty and Disease. It is
to this also that so many excellent young Women, who might be Patterns
of conjugal Affection and Parents of a worthy Race, pine under unhappy
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec528.txt')">Passions</a> for such as have not Attention enough to observe, or Virtue
enough to prefer them to their common Wenches. Now, _Mr_. SPECTATOR, I
must be free to own to you, that I my self suffer a tasteless insipid
Being, from a Consideration I have for a Man who would not, as he has
said in my hearing, resign his Liberty, as he calls it, for all the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec528.txt')">Beauty</a> and Wealth the whole Sex is possessed of. Such Calamities as
these would not happen, if it could possibly be brought about, that by
fining Batchelors as Papists Convict, or the like, they were
distinguished to their disadvantage from the rest of the World, who
fall in with the Measures of Civil Society. Lest you should think I
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec528.txt')">speak</a> this as being, according to the senseless rude Phrase, a
malicious old Maid, I shall acquaint you I am a Woman of Condition not
now three and twenty, and have had Proposals from at least ten
different Men, and the greater Number of them have upon the Upshot
refused me. Something or other is always amiss when the Lover takes to
some new Wench: A Settlement is easily excepted against; and there is
very little Recourse to avoid the vicious Part of our Youth, but
throwing one's self away upon some lifeless Blockhead, who tho' he is
without <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec528.txt')">Vice</a>, is also without Virtue. Now-a-days we must be contented
if we can get Creatures which are not bad, good are not to be
expected. Mr. SPECTATOR, I sat near you the other Day, and think I did
not displease you Spectatorial Eyesight; which I shall be a better
Judge of when I see whether you take notice of these Evils your own
way, or print this Memorial dictated from the disdainful heavy Heart
of,</p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>_Your most obedient humble Servant_,</p><p>Rachael Welladay.</p><p>
