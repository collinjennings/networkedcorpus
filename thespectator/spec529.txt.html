<p>No. 529.              Thursday, November 6, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Singula qu√¶que locum teneant sortita decenter.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Upon the hearing of several late Disputes concerning Rank and
Precedence, I could not forbear amusing my self with some Observations,
which I have made upon the Learned <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec529.txt')">World</a>, as to this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec529.txt')">great</a> Particular.
By the Learned World I here mean at large, all those who are any way
concerned in Works of Literature, whether in the <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec529.txt')">Writing</a>, Printing or
Repeating <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec529.txt')">Part</a>. To begin with the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec529.txt')">Writers</a>; I have observed that the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec529.txt')">Author</a> of a _Folio_, in all Companies and Conversations, sets himself
above the Author of a _Quarto_; the Author of a _Quarto_ above the
Author of an _Octavo_; and so on, by a gradual Descent and
Subordination, to an Author in _Twenty Fours_. This Distinction is so
well observed, that in an Assembly of the Learned, I have seen a _Folio_
Writer place himself in an Elbow-Chair, when the Author of a
_Duo-decimo_ has, out of a just Deference to his superior Quality,
seated himself upon a Squabb. In a word, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec529.txt')">Authors</a> are usually ranged in
Company after the same manner as their Works are upon a Shelf.</p><p>The most minute Pocket-Author hath beneath him the Writers of all
Pamphlets, or Works that are only stitched. As for the Pamphleteer, he
takes place of none but of the Authors of single Sheets, and of that
Fraternity who publish their Labours on certain Days, or on every Day of
the Week. I do not find that the Precedency among the Individuals, in
this latter Class of Writers, is yet settled.</p><p>For my own part, I have had so strict a regard to the Ceremonial which
prevails in the Learned World, that I never presumed to take place of a
Pamphleteer till my daily Papers were gathered into those two first
Volumes, which have already appeared. After which, I naturally jumped
over the Heads not only of all Pamphleteers, but of every _Octavo_
Writer in _Great Britain_, that had written but one Book. I am also
informed by my Bookseller, that six _Octavo's_ have at all times been
look'd upon as an Equivalent to a _Folio_, which I take notice of the
rather, because I would not have the Learned World surprized, if after
the Publication of half a dozen Volumes I take my Place accordingly.
When my scattered Forces are thus rallied, and reduced into regular
Bodies, I flatter my self that I shall make no despicable Figure at the
Head of them.</p><p>Whether these Rules, which have been received time out of Mind in the
Common-Wealth of Letters, were not originally established with an Eye to
our Paper Manufacture, I shall leave to the Discussion of others, and
shall only remark further in this place, that all Printers and
Booksellers take the Wall of one another, according to the
abovementioned Merits of the Authors to whom they respectively belong.</p><p>I come now to that point of Precedency which is settled among the three
Learned Professions, by the Wisdom of our Laws. I need not here take
Notice of the Rank which is allotted to every Doctor in each of these
Professions, who are all of them, though not so high as Knights, yet a
Degree above Squires; this last Order of Men being the illiterate Body
of the Nation, are consequently thrown together into a Class below the
three Learned Professions. I mention this for the sake of several Rural
'Squires, whose Reading does not rise so high as to _the Present State
of England_, and who are often apt to usurp that Precedency which by the
Laws of their Country is not due to them. Their Want of Learning, which
has planted them in this Station, may in some measure extenuate their
Misdemeanour; and our Professors ought to pardon them when they offend
in this Particular, considering that they are in a State of Ignorance,
or, as we usually say, do not know their Right Hand from their Left.</p><p>There is another Tribe of Persons who are Retainers to the Learned
World, and who regulate themselves upon all Occasions by several Laws
peculiar to their Body. I mean the Players or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec529.txt')">Actors</a> of both Sexes.
Among these it is a standing and uncontroverted Principle, that a
Tragedian always takes place of a Comedian; and 'tis very well known the
merry Drolls who make us laugh are always placed at the lower End of the
Table, and in every Entertainment give way to the Dignity of the Buskin.
It is a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec529.txt')">Stage</a> Maxim, _Once a King, and always a King_. For this Reason
it would be thought very absurd in Mr. Bullock, notwithstanding the
Height and Gracefulness of his Person, to sit at the Right Hand of an
Hero, tho' he were but five Foot high. The same Distinction is observed
among the Ladies of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec529.txt')">Theatre</a>. Queens and Heroines preserve their Rank
in private Conversation, while those who are Waiting-Women and Maids of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec529.txt')">Honour</a> upon the Stage, keep their Distance also behind the Scenes.</p><p>I shall only add, that by a Parity of Reason, all Writers of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec529.txt')">Tragedy</a>
look upon it as their due to be seated, served, or saluted before Comick
Writers: Those who deal in Tragi-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec529.txt')">Comedy</a> usually taking their Seats
between the Authors of either Side. There has been a long Dispute for
Precedency between the Tragick and Heroick Poets. _Aristotle_ would have
the latter yield the _Pas_ to the former, but Mr. _Dryden_ and many
others would never submit to this Decision. Burlesque Writers pay the
same Deference to the Heroick, as Comick Writers to their Serious
Brothers in the Drama.</p><p>By this short Table of Laws, Order is kept up, and Distinction preserved
in the whole Republick of Letters.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
