<p>No. 53.                Tuesday, May 1, 1711.                 Steele.</p><p></p><p>... Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus.</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
My Correspondents grow so numerous, that I cannot avoid frequently
inserting their Applications to me.</p><p>
Mr SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I am glad I can inform you, that your Endeavours to adorn that <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec53.txt')">Sex</a>,
which is the fairest Part of the visible Creation, are well received,
and like to prove not unsuccessful. The Triumph of _Daphne_ over her
Sister _Letitia_ has been the Subject of <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec53.txt')">Conversation</a> at Several
Tea-Tables where I have been present; and I have observed the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec53.txt')">fair</a>
Circle not a little pleased to find you considering them as reasonable
Creatures, and endeavouring to banish that _Mahometan_ Custom which
had too much prevailed even in this Island, of treating <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec53.txt')">Women</a> as if
they had no Souls. I must do them the Justice to say, that there seems
to be nothing wanting to the finishing of these lovely Pieces of Human
Nature, besides the turning and applying their <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec53.txt')">Ambition</a> properly, and
the keeping them up to a Sense of what is their true <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec53.txt')">Merit</a>.
_Epictetus_, that plain honest Philosopher, as little as he had of
Gallantry, appears to have understood them, as well as the polite St.
_Evremont_, and has hit this Point very luckily.[1] _When <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec53.txt')">young</a>
Women_, says he, _arrive at a certain Age, they hear themselves called
_Mistresses_, and are made to believe that their only Business is to
please the Men; they immediately begin to dress, and place all their
Hopes in the adorning of their Persons; it is therefore_, continues
he, _worth the while to endeavour by all means to make them sensible
that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec53.txt')">Honour</a> paid to them is only, upon account of their
cotiducting themselves with Virtue, Modesty, and Discretion_.</p><p>'Now to pursue the Matter yet further, and to render your Cares for
the Improvement of the Fair Ones more effectual, I would propose a new
method, like those Applications which are said to convey their virtues
by Sympathy; and that is, in order to embellish the Mistress, you
should give a new Education to the Lover, and teach the Men not to be
any longer dazzled by false Charms and unreal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec53.txt')">Beauty</a>. I cannot but
think that if our Sex knew always how to place their Esteem justly,
the other would not be so often wanting to themselves in deserving it.
For as the being enamoured with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec53.txt')">Woman</a> of Sense and Virtue is an
Improvement to a Man's Understanding and Morals, and the Passion is
ennobled by the Object which inspires it; so on the other side, the
appearing amiable to a Man of a wise and elegant Mind, carries in it
self no small Degree of Merit and Accomplishment. I conclude
therefore, that one way to make the Women yet more <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec53.txt')">agreeable</a> is, to
make the Men more virtuous.</p><p>I am, SIR,</p><p>Your most humble Servant,</p><p>R. B.'</p><p></p><p>April 26.</p><p>SIR,</p><p>'Yours of _Saturday_ last I read, not without some Resentment; but I
will suppose when you say you expect an Inundation of Ribbons and
Brocades, and to see many new Vanities which the Women will fall into
upon a Peace with _France_, that you intend only the unthinking Part
of our Sex: And what Methods can reduce them to Reason is hard to
imagine.</p><p>But, Sir, there are others yet, that your Instructions might be of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec53.txt')">great</a> Use to, who, after their best Endeavours, are sometimes at a
<a name="topic28" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('28', 'spec53.txt')">loss</a> to acquit themselves to a Censorious <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec53.txt')">World</a>: I am far from
thinking you can altogether disapprove of Conversation between <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec53.txt')">Ladies</a>
and Gentlemen, regulated by the Rules of Honour and Prudence; and have
thought it an Observation not ill made, that where that was wholly
denied, the Women lost their Wit, and the Men their Good-manners. 'Tis
sure, from those improper Liberties you mentioned, that a sort of
undistinguishing <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec53.txt')">People</a> shall banish from their Drawing-Rooms the
best-bred Men in the World, and condemn those that do not. Your
stating this Point might, I think, be of good use, as well as much
oblige,</p><p>SIR,</p><p>Your Admirer, and
most humble Servant,</p><p>ANNA BELLA.'</p><p>
_No Answer to this, till_ Anna Bella _sends a Description of those she
calls the Best-bred Men in the World_.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I am a Gentleman who for many Years last past have been well known to
be truly Splenatick, and that my Spleen arises from having contracted
so great a Delicacy, by reading the best Authors, and keeping the most
refined <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec53.txt')">Company</a>, that I cannot bear the least Impropriety of Language,
or Rusticity of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec53.txt')">Behaviour</a>. Now, Sir, I have ever looked upon this as a
wise <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('28', 'spec53.txt')">Distemper</a>; but by late Observations find that every heavy Wretch,
who has nothing to say, excuses his Dulness by complaining of the
Spleen. Nay, I saw, the other Day, two Fellows in a Tavern Kitchen set
up for it, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec53.txt')">call</a> for a Pint and Pipes, and only by Guzling Liquor to
each other's Health, and wafting Smoke in each other's Face, pretend
to throw off the Spleen. I appeal to you, whether these Dishonours are
to be done to the Distemper of the Great and the Polite. I beseech
you, Sir, to inform these Fellows that they have not the Spleen,
because they cannot talk without the help of a Glass at their Mouths,
or convey their Meaning to each other without the Interposition of
Clouds. If you will not do this with all Speed, I assure you, for my
part, I will wholly quit the Disease, and for the future be merry with
the Vulgar.</p><p>I am, SIR,</p><p>Your humble Servant.'</p><p></p><p>SIR,</p><p>'This is to let you understand, that I am a reformed Starer, and
conceived a Detestation for that Practice from what you have writ upon
the Subject. But as you have been very severe upon the Behaviour of us
Men at Divine Service, I hope you will not be so apparently partial to
the Women, as to let them go wholly unobserved. If they do everything
that is possible to attract our Eyes, are we more culpable than they
for looking at them? I happened last _Sunday_ to be shut into a Pew,
which was full of young Ladies in the Bloom of Youth and Beauty. When
the Service began, I had not Room to kneel at the Confession, but as I
stood kept my eyes from wandring as well as I was able, till one of
the young Ladies, who is a Peeper, resolved to bring down my Looks,
and fix my Devotion on her self. You are to know, Sir, that a Peeper
works with her Hands, Eyes, and Fan; one of which is continually in
Motion, while she thinks she is not actually the Admiration of some
Ogler or Starer in the Congregation. As I stood utterly at a loss how
to behave my self, surrounded as I was, this Peeper so placed her self
as to be kneeling just before me. She displayed the most beautiful
Bosom imaginable, which heaved and fell with some Fervour, while a
delicate well-shaped Arm held a Fan over her Face. It was not in
Nature to command ones Eyes from this Object; I could not avoid taking
notice also of her Fan, which had on it various Figures, very improper
to behold on that Occasion. There lay in the Body of the Piece a
_Venus_, under a Purple Canopy furled with curious Wreaths of Drapery,
half naked, attended with a Train of _Cupids_, who were busied in
Fanning her as she slept. Behind her was drawn a Satyr peeping over
the silken Fence, and threatening to break through it. I frequently
offered to turn my Sight another way, but was still detained by the
Fascination of the Peeper's Eyes, who had long practised a Skill in
them, to recal the parting Glances of her Beholders. You see my
Complaint, and hope you will take these mischievous People, the
Peepers, into your Consideration: I doubt not but you will think a
Peeper as much more pernicious than a Starer, as an Ambuscade is more
to be feared than an open Assault.</p><p>I am, SIR,</p><p>Your most Obedient Servant.'</p><p>
_This Peeper using both Fan and Eyes to be considered as a _Pict_, and
proceed accordingly._</p><p>
King _Latinus_ to the _Spectator_, Greeting.</p><p>'Tho' some may think we descend from our Imperial Dignity, in holding
Correspondence with a private [_Litterato_; [2]] yet as we have great
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec53.txt')">Respect</a> to all good Intentions for our Service, we do not esteem it
beneath us to return you our Royal Thanks for what you published in
our Behalf, while under Confinement in the Inchanted Castle of the
_Savoy_, and for your Mention of a Subsidy for a Prince in Misfortune.
This your timely Zeal has inclined the Hearts of divers to be aiding
unto us, if we could propose the Means. We have taken their Good will
into Consideration, and have contrived a Method which will be easy to
those who shall give the Aid, and not unacceptable to us who receive
it. A Consort of Musick shall be prepared at _Haberdashers-Hall_ for
_Wednesday_ the Second of _May_, and we will honour the said
Entertainment with our own Presence, where each Person shall be
assessed but at two Shillings and six Pence. What we expect from you
is, that you publish these our Royal Intentions, with Injunction that
they be read at all Tea-Tables within the Cities of _London_ and
_Westminster_; and so we bid you heartily Farewell.</p><p>_Latinus_, King of the _Volscians_.'</p><p>_Given at our Court in_ Vinegar-Yard, _Story the Third from the Earth_.</p><p>April 28, 1711.</p><p>
