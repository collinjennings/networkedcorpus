<p>No. 530.               Friday, November 7, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Sic visum Veneri; cui placet impares
Formas atque animos sub juga ahenea

It is very usual for those who have been severe upon <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec530.txt')">Marriage</a>, in some
part or other of their Lives to enter into the Fraternity which they
have ridiculed, and to see their Raillery return upon their own Heads. I
scarce ever knew a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec530.txt')">Woman</a>-hater that did not, sooner or later, pay for
it. Marriage, which is a Blessing to another Man, falls upon such a one
as a Judgment. Mr. _Congreve's Old Batchelor_ [1] is set forth to us
with much Wit and Humour, as an Example of this kind. In short, those
who have most distinguished themselves by railing at the <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec530.txt')">Sex</a> in general,
very often make an honourable Amends, by chusing one of the most
worthless Persons of it, for a Companion and Yoke-fellow. _Hymen_ takes
his Revenge in kind, on those who turn his Mysteries into Ridicule.</p><p>My <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec530.txt')">Friend</a> _Will Honeycomb_, who was so unmercifully witty upon the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec530.txt')">Women</a>, in a couple of Letters, which I lately communicated to the
Publick, has given the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec530.txt')">Ladies</a> ample Satisfaction by marrying a Farmer's
Daughter; a piece of News which came to our Club by the last Post. The
_Templer_ is very positive that he has <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec530.txt')">married</a> a Dairy-maid: But _Will_,
in his Letter to me on this Occasion, sets the best Face upon the Matter
that he can, and gives a more tollerable Account of his Spouse. I must
confess I suspected something more than ordinary, when upon opening the
Letter I found that _Will_ was fallen off from his former Gayety, having
changed _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec530.txt')">Dear</a> Spec_. which was his usual Salute at the Beginning of the
Letter, into _My <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec530.txt')">Worthy</a> Friend_, and subscribed himself in the latter
End of it at full length _William Honeycomb_. In short, the gay, the
loud, the vain _Will Honeycomb_, who had made <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec530.txt')">Love</a> to every <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec530.txt')">great</a>
Fortune that has appeared in Town for [above [2]] thirty Years together,
and boasted of Favours from Ladies whom he had never seen, is at length
wedded to a plain <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec530.txt')">Country</a> Girl.</p><p>His Letter gives us the Picture of a converted Rake. The sober Character
of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec530.txt')">Husband</a> is dashed with the Man of the Town, and enlivened with
those little Cant-phrases which have made my Friend _Will_ often thought
very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec530.txt')">pretty</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec530.txt')">Company</a>. But let us hear what he says for himself.</p><p>
_My Worthy Friend_,</p><p>I question not but you, and the rest of my Acquaintance, wonder that
I, who have lived in the Smoak and Gallantries of the Town for thirty
Years together, should all on a sudden grow fond of a Country Life.
Had not my Dog [of a [3]] Steward run away as he did, without making
up his Accounts, I had still been immersed in Sin and Sea-Coal. But
since my late forced Visit to my Estate, I am so pleased with it, that
I am resolved to live and die upon it. I am every Day abroad among my
Acres, and can scarce forbear filling my Letter with Breezes, Shades,
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec530.txt')">Flowers</a>, Meadows, and purling Streams. The Simplicity of Manners,
which I have heard you so often <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec530.txt')">speak</a> of, and which appears here in
Perfection, charms me wonderfully. As an Instance of it, I must
acquaint you, and by your means the whole Club, that I have lately
married one of my Tenants Daughters. She is born of honest Parents,
and though she has no Portion, she has a great deal of Virtue. The
natural Sweetness and Innocence of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec530.txt')">Behaviour</a>, the Freshness of her
Complection, the unaffected Turn of her Shape and Person, shot me
through and through every time I saw her, and did more Execution upon
me in Grogram, than the greatest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec530.txt')">Beauty</a> in Town or Court had ever done
in Brocade. In short, she is such an one as promises me a good Heir to
my Estate; and if by her means I cannot leave to my Children what are
falsely called the Gifts of Birth; high Titles and Alliances: I hope
to convey to them the more real and valuable Gifts of Birth; strong
Bodies, and Healthy Constitutions. As for your fine Women, I need not
tell thee that I know them. I have had my share in their Graces, but
no more of that. It shall be my Business hereafter to live the Life of
an honest Man, and to act as becomes the Master of a Family. I
question not but I shall draw upon me the Raillery of the Town, and be
treated to the Tune of the _Marriage-Hater match'd_; but I am prepared
for it. I have been as witty upon others in my time. To tell thee
truly, I saw such a Tribe of Fashionable <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec530.txt')">young</a> fluttering Coxcombs
shot up, that I did not think my Post of an _homme de ruelle_ any
longer tenable. I felt a certain Stiffness in my Limbs, which entirely
destroyed that Jauntyness of Air I was once Master of. Besides, for I
may now confess my Age to thee, I have been eight and forty above
these Twelve Years. Since my Retirement into the Country will make a
Vacancy in the Club, I could wish you would fill up my Place with my
Friend _Tom Dapperwit_. He has an infinite deal of Fire, and knows the
Town. For my own part, as I have said before, I shall endeavour to
live hereafter suitable to a Man in my Station, as a prudent Head of a
Family, a good Husband, a careful Father (when it shall so happen) and
as</p><p>_Your most Sincere Friend,
and Humble Servant_,</p><p>WILLIAM HONEYCOMB.</p><p>
