<p>No. 531.              Saturday, November 8. 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Qui mare et terras variisque mundum
Temperat horis:
Unde nil majus generatur ipso,
Nec viget quicquam simile aut secundum.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
Simonides being ask'd by _Dionysius_ the Tyrant what <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec531.txt')">God</a> was, desired a
Day's time to consider of it before he made his Reply. When the Day was
expired, he desired two Days; and afterwards, instead of returning his
Answer, demanded still double the Time to consider of it. This great
Poet and Philosopher, the more he contemplated the <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec531.txt')">Nature</a> of the Deity,
found that he waded but the more out of his Depth; and that he lost
himself in the Thought, instead of finding an End of it. [1]</p><p>If we consider the Idea which wise Men, by the Light of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec531.txt')">Reason</a>, have
framed of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec531.txt')">Divine</a> Being, it amounts to this: That he has in him all
the Perfection of a Spiritual Nature; and since we have no Notion of any
kind of spiritual Perfection but what we discover in our own Souls, we
joyn Infinitude to each kind of these Perfections, and what is a Faculty
in an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec531.txt')">human</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec531.txt')">Soul</a> becomes an Attribute in God. _We_ exist in Place and
Time, the Divine Being fills the Immensity of Space with his Presence,
and Inhabits Eternity. _We_ are possessed of a little Power and a little
Knowledge, the Divine Being is Almighty and Omniscient. In short, by
adding Infinity to any kind of Perfection we enjoy, and by joyning all
these different kinds of Perfections in one Being, we form our Idea of
the great Sovereign of Nature.</p><p>Though every one who thinks must have made this Observation, I shall
produce Mr. _Locke's_ Authority to the same purpose, out of his Essay on
Human Understanding.</p><p>'If we examine the _Idea_ we have of the incomprehensible Supreme
Being, we shall find, that we come by it the same way; and that the
complex _Ideas_ we have both of God and separate Spirits, are made up
of the simple _Ideas_ we receive from _Reflection: v. g._ having from
what we experiment in our selves, got the _Ideas_ of Existence and
Duration, of Knowledge and Power, of Pleasure and Happiness, and of
several other Qualities and Powers, which it is better to have, than
to be without; when we would frame an _Idea_ the most suitable we can
to the Supreme Being, we enlarge every one of these with our _Idea_ of
Infinity; and so putting them together, make our Complex _Idea of
God_.' [2]</p><p>It is not impossible that there may be many kinds of Spiritual
Perfection, besides those which are lodged in an human Soul; but it is
impossible that we should have Ideas of any kinds of Perfection, except
those of which we have some small Rays and short imperfect Strokes in
our selves. It would be therefore a very high Presumption to determine
whether the Supream Being has not many more Attributes than those which
enter into our Conceptions of him. This is certain, that if there be any
kind of Spiritual Perfection which is not marked out in an human Soul,
it belongs in its Fulness to the Divine Nature.</p><p>Several eminent Philosophers have imagined that the Soul, in her
separate State, may have new Faculties springing up in her, which she is
not capable of exerting during her present Union with the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec531.txt')">Body</a>; and
whether these Faculties may not correspond with other Attributes in the
Divine Nature, and open to us hereafter new Matter of Wonder and
Adoration, we are altogether ignorant. This, as I have said before, we
ought to acquiesce in, that the Sovereign Being, the great Author of
Nature, has in him all possible Perfection, as well in _Kind_ as in
_Degree_; to <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec531.txt')">speak</a> according to our Methods of [conceiving. [3]] I shall
only add under this Head, that when we have raised our Notion of this
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec531.txt')">Infinite</a> Being as high as it is possible for the Mind of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec531.txt')">Man</a> to go, it
will fall infinitely short of what He really is. _There is no end of his
Greatness_: The most exalted Creature he has made, is only capable of
adoring it, none but himself can comprehend it.</p><p>The Advice of the Son of _Sirach_ is very just and sublime in this
Light.</p><p>'By his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec531.txt')">Word</a> all things consist. We may speak much, and yet come
short: wherefore in sum, he is all. How shall we be able to magnify
him? For he is great above all his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec531.txt')">Works</a>. The Lord is terrible and
very great; and marvellous in his Power. When you glorify the Lord,
exalt him as much as you can; for even yet will he far exceed. And
when you exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for
you can never go far enough. Who hath seen him, that he might tell us?
And who can magnify him as he is? There are yet hid greater things
than these be, for we have seen but a few of his Works.' [4]</p><p>I have here only considered the Supreme Being by the Light of Reason and
Philosophy. If we would see him in all the Wonders of his Mercy we must
have recourse to Revelation, which represents him to us, not only as
infinitely Great and Glorious, but as infinitely Good and Just in his
Dispensations towards Man. But as this is a Theory which falls under
every one's Consideration, tho' indeed it can never be sufficiently
considered, I shall here only take notice of that habitual <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec531.txt')">Worship</a> and
Veneration which we ought to pay to this Almighty Being. We should often
refresh our Minds with the Thought of him, and annihilate our selves
before him, in the Contemplation of our own Worthlessness, and of his
transcendent Excellency and Perfection. This would imprint in our Minds
such a constant and uninterrupted Awe and Veneration as that which I am
here recommending, and which is in reality a kind of incessant Prayer,
and reasonable Humiliation of the Soul before him who made it.</p><p>This would effectually kill in us all the little Seeds of Pride, Vanity
and Self-conceit, which are apt to shoot up in the Minds of such whose
Thoughts turn more on those comparative Advantages which they enjoy over
some of their Fellow-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec531.txt')">Creatures</a>, than on that infinite Distance which is
placed between them and the Supreme Model of all Perfection. It would
likewise quicken our Desires and Endeavours of uniting our selves to him
by all the Acts of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec531.txt')">Religion</a> and Virtue.</p><p>Such an habitual Homage to the Supreme Being would, in a particular
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec531.txt')">manner</a>, banish from among us that prevailing Impiety of using his Name
on the most trivial Occasions.</p><p>I find the following Passage in an excellent Sermon, preached at the
Funeral of a Gentleman who was an Honour to his Country, and a more
diligent as well as successful Enquirer into the Works of Nature, than
any other our Nation has ever produced. [5]</p><p>'He had the profoundest Veneration for the Great God of Heaven and
Earth that I have ever observed in any Person. The very Name of God
was never mentioned by him without a Pause and a visible Stop in his
Discourse; in which, one that knew him most particularly above twenty
Years, has told me, that he was so exact, that he does not remember to
have observed him once to fail in it.'</p><p>Every one knows the Veneration which was paid by the _Jews_ to a Name so
great, wonderful and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec531.txt')">holy</a>. They would not let it enter even into their
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec531.txt')">religious</a> Discourses. What can we then think of those who make use of so
tremendous a Name in the ordinary Expressions of their Anger, Mirth, and
most impertinent Passions? Of those who admit it into the most familiar
Questions and Assertions, ludicrous Phrases and Works of Humour? not to
mention those who violate it by solemn Perjuries? It would be an Affront
to Reason to endeavour to set forth the Horror and Prophaneness of such
a Practice. The very mention of it exposes it sufficiently to those in
whom the Light of Nature, not to say Religion, is not utterly
extinguished.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: This story is taken from Book I. of Cicero 'De Naturâ
