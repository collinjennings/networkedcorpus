<p>No. 533.              Tuesday, November 11, 1712.                Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Immo duas dabo, inquit ille, una si parum est:
Et si duarum pænitebit, addentur duæ.'</p><p>Plaut.</p><p>
_To the_ SPECTATOR.</p><p>_SIR,_</p><p>'You have often given us very excellent Discourses against that
unnatural Custom of Parents, in forcing their Children to marry
contrary to their Inclinations. My own Case, without further Preface,
I will lay before you, and leave you to judge of it. My Father and
Mother both being in declining Years, would fain see me, their eldest
Son, as they <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec533.txt')">call</a> it settled. I am as much for that as they can be;
but I must be settled, it seems, not according to my own, but their
liking. Upon this account I am teaz'd every Day, because I have not
yet fallen in love, in spite of Nature, with one of a neighbouring
Gentleman's Daughters; for out of their abundant Generosity, they give
me the choice of four. _Jack_, begins my Father, Mrs. _Catherine_ is a
fine <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec533.txt')">Woman</a>--Yes, Sir, but she is rather too old--She will make the
more discreet Manager, Boy. Then my Mother plays her part. Is not Mrs.
_Betty_ exceeding <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec533.txt')">fair</a>? Yes, Madam, but she is of no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec533.txt')">Conversation</a>; she
has no Fire, no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec533.txt')">agreeable</a> Vivacity; she neither speaks nor looks with
Spirit. True, Son; but for those very Reasons, she will be an easy,
soft, obliging, tractable Creature. After all, cries an old Aunt, (who
belongs to the Class of those who read Plays with Spectacles on) what
think you, Nephew, of proper Mrs. _Dorothy_? What do I think? why I
think she cannot be above six foot two inches high. Well, well, you
may banter as long as you please, but Height of Stature is commanding
and majestick. Come, come, says a Cousin of mine in the Family, I'll
fit him; _Fidelia_ is yet behind--<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec533.txt')">Pretty</a> Miss _Fiddy_ must please
you--Oh! your very humble Servant, dear Cos. she is as much too <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec533.txt')">young</a>
as her eldest Sister is too old. Is it so indeed, quoth she, good Mr.
_Pert_? You who are but barely turned of twenty two, and Miss Fiddy in
half a Year's time will be in her Teens, and she is capable of
learning any thing. Then she will be so observant; she'll cry perhaps
now and then, but never be angry. Thus they will think for me in this
matter, wherein I am more particularly concerned than any Body else.
If I name any Woman in the World, one of these Daughters has certainly
the same Qualities. You see by these few Hints, _Mr._ SPECTATOR, what
a comfortable Life I lead. To be still more open and free with you, I
have been passionately fond of a young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec533.txt')">Lady</a> (whom give me leave to
call _Miranda_) now for these three Years. I have often urged the
Matter home to my Parents with all the Submission of a Son, but the
Impatience of a Lover. Pray, Sir, think of three Years; what
inexpressible Scenes of Inquietude, what Variety of Misery must I have
gone thro' in three long whole Years? _Miranda's_ Fortune is equal to
those I have mention'd; but her Relations are not Intimates with mine.
Ah! there's the Rub. _Miranda's_ Person, Wit, and Humour, are what the
nicest Fancy could imagine; and though we know you to be so elegant a
Judge of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec533.txt')">Beauty</a>, yet there is none among all your various Characters
of fine <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec533.txt')">Women</a> preferable to _Miranda_. In a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec533.txt')">Word</a>, she is never guilty
of doing any thing but one amiss, (if she can be thought to do amiss
by me) in being as blind to my Faults, as she is to her own
Perfections.</p><p>_I am, SIR,
Your very humble obedient Servant,_
Dustererastus.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'When you spent so much time as you did lately in censuring the
ambitious young Gentlemen who ride in Triumph through Town and Country
in Coach-boxes, I wished you had employed those Moments in
consideration of what passes sometimes within-side of those Vehicles.
I am sure I suffered sufficiently by the Insolence and Ill-breeding of
some Persons who travelled lately with me in a Stage-Coach out of
_Essex_ to _London_. I am sure, when you have heard what I have to
say, you will think there are Persons under the Character of Gentlemen
that are fit to be no where else but in the Coach-box. Sir, I am a
young Woman of a sober and religious Education, and have preserved
that Character; but on Monday was Fortnight it was my Misfortune to
come to _London_. I was no sooner clapt in the Coach, but to my great
Surprize, two Persons in the Habit of Gentlemen attack'd me with such
indecent Discourse as I cannot repeat to you, so you may conclude not
fit for me to hear. I had no relief but the Hopes of a speedy End of
my short Journey. Sir, form to your self what a Persecution this must
needs be to a virtuous and a chaste Mind; and in order to your proper
handling such a Subject, fancy your Wife or Daughter, if you had any,
in such Circumstances, and what Treatment you would think then due to
such Dragoons. One of them was called a Captain, and entertained us
with nothing but silly stupid Questions, or lewd Songs, all the way.
Ready to burst with Shame and Indignation, I repined that Nature had
not allowed us as easily to shut our Ears as our Eyes. But was not
this a kind of Rape? Why should there be Accessaries in Ravishment any
more than Murder? Why should not every Contributor to the Abuse of
Chastity suffer Death? I am sure these shameless Hell-hounds deserved
it highly. Can you exert your self better than on such an Occasion? If
you do not do it effectually, I 'll read no more of your Papers. Has
every impertinent Fellow a Privilege to torment me, who pay my
Coach-hire as well as he? Sir, pray consider us in this respect as the
weakest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec533.txt')">Sex</a>, and have nothing to defend our selves; and I think it as
Gentleman-like to challenge a Woman to fight, as to talk obscenely in
her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec533.txt')">Company</a>, especially when she has not power to stir. Pray let me
tell you a Story which you can make fit for publick View. I knew a
Gentleman, who having a very good Opinion of the Gentlemen of the
Army, invited ten or twelve of them to sup with him; and at the same
time invited two or three Friends, who were very severe against the
Manners and Morals of Gentlemen of that Profession. It happened one of
them brought two Captains of his Regiment newly come into the Army,
who at first Onset engaged the Company with very lewd Healths and
suitable Discourse. You may easily imagine the Confusion of the
Entertainer, who finding some of his Friends very uneasy, desired to
tell them a Story of a great Man, one Mr, _Locke_ (whom I find you
frequently mention) that being invited to dine with the then Lords
_Hallifax, Anglesey_, and _Shaftsbury_; immediately after Dinner,
instead of Conversation, the Cards were called for, where the bad or
good Success produced the usual Passions of Gaming. Mr. _Locke_
retiring to a Window, and writing, my Lord _Anglesey_ desired to know
what he was writing: _Why, my Lords_, answered he, _I could not sleep
last Night for the Pleasure and Improvement I expected from the
Conversation of the greatest Men of the Age_. This so sensibly stung
them, that they gladly compounded to throw their Cards in the Fire if
he would his Paper, and so a Conversation ensued fit for such Persons.
This Story prest so hard upon the young Captains, together with the
Concurrence of their superior Officers, that the young Fellows left
the Company in Confusion. Sir, I know you hate long things; but if you
like it, you may contract it, or how you will; but I think it has a
Moral in it.</p><p>But, Sir, I am told you are a famous Mechanick as well as a Looker-on,
and therefore humbly propose you would invent some Padlock, with full
Power under your Hand and Seal, for all modest Persons, either Men or
Women, to clap upon the Mouths of all such impertinent impudent
Fellows: And I wish you would publish a Proclamation, that no modest
Person who has a Value for her Countenance, and consequently would not
be put out of it, presume to travel after such a Day without one of
them in their Pockets. I fancy a smart _Spectator_ upon this Subject
would serve for such a Padlock; and that publick Notice may be given
in your Paper where they may be had with Directions, Price 2_d_. and
that part of the Directions may be, when any Person presumes to be
guilty of the above-mentioned Crime, the Party aggrieved may produce
it to his Face, with a Request to read it to the Company. He must be
very much hardened that could outface that Rebuke; and his further
Punishment I leave you to prescribe.</p><p>_Your humble Servant_,
Penance Cruel.</p><p>T. [1]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: To this number is appended the advertisement:</p><p>This Day is Published,</p><p>a very neat Pocket Edition of the 3rd and 4th Volumes of the Spectator
