<p>No. 534.           Wednesday, November 12, 1712.                 Steele.</p><p></p><p>'--Rarus enim fermè sensus communis in illa
Fortunâ--'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I am a <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec534.txt')">young</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec534.txt')">Woman</a> of Nineteen, the only Daughter of very wealthy
Parents; and have my whole Life been used with a Tenderness which did
me no great Service in my Education. I have perhaps an uncommon Desire
for Knowledge of what is suitable to my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec534.txt')">Sex</a> and Quality; but as far as
I can remember, the whole Dispute about me has been, whether such a
thing was proper for the Child to do, or not? Or whether such or such
Food was the more wholsome for the young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec534.txt')">Lady</a> to eat? This was ill for
my Shape, that for my Complexion, and t'other for my Eyes. I am not
extravagant when I tell you, I do not know that I have trod upon the
very Earth since I was ten Years old: A Coach or Chair I am obliged to
for all my Motions from one Place to another ever since I can
remember. All who had to do to instruct me, have ever been bringing
Stories of the notable things I have said and the Womanly <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec534.txt')">manner</a> of my
behaving my self upon such and such an Occasion. This has been my
State, till I came towards Years of Womanhood; and ever since I grew
towards the Age of Fifteen, I have been abused after another Manner.
Now, forsooth, I am so killing, no one can safely <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec534.txt')">speak</a> to me. Our
House is frequented by Men of Sense, and I <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec534.txt')">love</a> to ask Questions when
I fall into such <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec534.txt')">Conversation</a>; but I am cut short with something or
other about my bright Eyes. There is, Sir, a Language particular for
talking to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec534.txt')">Women</a> in; and none but those of the very first good
Breeding (who are very few, and who seldom come into my way) can speak
to us without regard to our Sex. Among the generality of those they
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec534.txt')">call</a> Gentlemen, it is impossible for me to speak upon any subject
whatsoever, without provoking somebody to say, _Oh! to be sure fine
Mrs. such-a-one must be very particularly acquainted with all that;
all the World will contribute to her Entertainment and Information_.
Thus, Sir, I am so handsome, that I murder all who approach me; so
wise, that I want no new Notices; and so well bred, that I am treated
by all that know me like a Fool, for no one will answer as if I were
their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec534.txt')">Friend</a> or Companion. Pray, Sir, be pleased to take the part of
us Beauties and Fortunes into your Consideration, and do not let us be
thus flattered out of our Senses. I have got an Hussey of a Maid, who
is most craftily given to this ill Quality. I was at first diverted
with a certain Absurdity the Creature was guilty of in every thing she
said: She is a Country Girl, and in the Dialect of the Shire she was
born in, would tell me that every body reckon'd her Lady had the
purest Red and White in the World: Then she would tell me, I was the
most like one _Sisly Dobson_ in their Town, who made the Miller make
away with himself, and walk afterwards in the Corn-Field where they
used to meet. With all this, this cunning Hussey can lay Letters in my
way, and put a Billet in my Gloves, and then stand in it she knows
nothing of it. I do not know, from my Birth to this Day, that I have
been ever treated by any one as I ought; and if it were not for a few
Books which I delight in, I should be at this Hour a Novice to all
common Sense. Would it not be worth your while to lay down Rules for
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec534.txt')">Behaviour</a> in this Case, and tell <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec534.txt')">People</a>, that we <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec534.txt')">Fair</a>-ones expect
honest plain Answers as well as other People? Why must I, good Sir,
because I have a good Air, a fine Complexion, and am in the Bloom of
my Years, be mis-led in all my Actions? and have the Notions of Good
and Ill confounded in my Mind, for no other Offence, but because I
have the Advantages of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec534.txt')">Beauty</a> and Fortune? Indeed, Sir, what with the
silly Homage which is paid to us by the sort of People I have above
spoken of, and the utter Negligence which others have for us, the
Conversation of us young Women of Condition is no other than what must
expose us to Ignorance and Vanity, if not Vice. All this is humbly
submitted to your Spectatorial Wisdom, by,</p><p>_SIR, Your humble Servant_,
Sharlot Wealthy.</p><p></p><p>Will's _Coffee-house_.</p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Pray, Sir, it will serve to fill up a Paper, if you put in this;
which is only to ask, whether that Copy of Verses, which is a
Paraphrase of _Isaiah_, in one of your Speculations, is not written by
Mr. _Pope_? Then you get on another Line, by putting in, with proper
Distances, as at the end of a Letter,</p><p>_I am, Sir,
Your humble Servant_,
Abraham Dapperwit.</p><p>
Mr. Dapperwit,</p><p>I am glad to get another Line forward, by saying that excellent Piece is
Mr. _Pope's_; and so, with proper Distances,</p><p>_I am, Sir,
Your humble Servant_,
S--r.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I was a wealthy Grocer in the City, and as fortunate as diligent; but
I was a single Man, and you know there are Women. One in particular
came to my Shop, who I wished might, but was afraid never would, make
a Grocer's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec534.txt')">Wife</a>. I thought, however, to take an effectual Way of
Courting, and sold to her at less Price than I bought, that I might
buy at less Price than I sold. She, you may be sure, often came, and
helped me to many Customers at the same Rate, fancying I was obliged
to her. You must needs think this was a good living Trade, and my
Riches must be vastly improved. In fine, I was nigh being declared
Bankrupt, when I declared my self her Lover, and she herself <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec534.txt')">married</a>.
I was just in a Condition to support my self, and am now in Hopes of
growing rich by losing my Customers.</p><p>_Yours_,</p><p>Jeremy Comfit.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am in the Condition of the Idol you was once pleased to mention, and
Bar-keeper of a Coffee-house. I believe it is needless to tell you the
Opportunities I must give, and the Importunities I suffer. But there
is one Gentleman who besieges me as close as the _French_ did
_Bouchain_. His Gravity makes him work cautious, and his regular
Approaches denote a good Engineer. You need not doubt of his Oratory,
as he is a Lawyer; and especially since he has had so little Use of it
at _Westminster_, he may spare the more for me.</p><p>What then can weak Woman do? I am willing to surrender, but he would
have it at Discretion, and I with Discretion. In the mean time, whilst
we parly, our several Interests are neglected. As his Siege grows
stronger, my Tea grows weaker; and while he pleads at my Bar, none
come to him for Counsel but _in Forma Pauperis_. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec534.txt')">Dear</a> Mr. SPECTATOR,
advise him not to insist upon hard Articles, nor by his irregular
Desires contradict the well-meaning Lines of his Countenance. If we
were agreed we might settle to something, as soon as we could
determine where we should get most, by the Law, at the Coffee-house,
or at Westminster.</p><p>_Your humble Servant_,</p><p>Lucinda Parly.</p><p></p><p>_A Minuit from Mr_. John Sly.</p><p>The World is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec534.txt')">pretty</a> regular for about forty Rod East, and ten West of
the Observatory of the said Mr. _Sly_; but he is credibly informed,
that when they are got beyond the Pass into the _Strand_, or those who
move City-ward are got within _Temple-Bar_, they are just as they were
before. It is there-fore humbly proposed that Moving-Centries may be
appointed all the busy Hours of the Day between the _Exchange_ and
_Westminster_, and report what passes to your Honour, or your
subordinate Officers, from Time to Time.</p><p></p><p>_Ordered_,</p><p>That Mr. _Sly_ name the said Officers, provided he will answer for their
Principles and Morals.</p><p>T.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
