<p>No. 535.               Thursday, November 13, 1712.            Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Spem longam reseces--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>My Four <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec535.txt')">Hundred</a> and Seventy First Speculation turned upon the Subject of
Hope in general. I design this Paper as a Speculation upon that vain and
foolish Hope, which is misemployed on Temporal Objects, and produces
many Sorrows and Calamities in human Life.</p><p>It is a Precept several times inculcated by _Horace_, that we should not
entertain an Hope of any thing in Life which lies at a great Distance
from us. The Shortness and Uncertainty of our Time here, makes such a
kind of Hope unreasonable and absurd. The Grave lies unseen between us
and the Object which we reach after: Where one Man lives to enjoy the
Good he has in view, ten thousand are cut off in the Pursuit of it.</p><p>It happens likewise unluckily, that one Hope no sooner dies in us but
another rises up in its stead. We are apt to fancy that we shall be
happy and satisfied if we possess ourselves of such and such particular
Enjoyments; but either by reason of their Emptiness, or the natural
Inquietude of the Mind, we have no sooner gained one Point but we extend
our Hopes to another. We still find new inviting Scenes and Landskips
lying behind those which at a Distance terminated our View.</p><p>The natural Consequences of such Reflections are these; that we should
take <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec535.txt')">Care</a> not to let our Hopes run out into too great a Length; that we
should sufficiently weigh the Objects of our Hope, whether they be such
as we may reasonably expect from them what we propose in their Fruition,
and whether they are such as we are pretty sure of attaining, in case
our Life extend itself so far. If we hope for things which are at too
great a Distance from, us, it is possible that we may be intercepted by
Death in our Progress towards them. If we hope for things of which we
have not thoroughly considered the value, our Disappointment will be
greater than our Pleasure in the Fruition of them. If we hope for what
we are not likely to possess, we act and think in vain, and make Life a
greater Dream and Shadow than it really is.</p><p>Many of the Miseries and Misfortunes of Life proceed from our Want of
Consideration, in one or all of these Particulars. They are the Rocks on
which the sanguine Tribe of Lovers daily split, and on which the
Bankrupt, the Politician, the Alchymist and Projector are cast away in
every Age. Men of warm Imaginations and towring Thoughts are apt to
overlook the Goods of Fortune [which are [1]] near them, for something
that glitters in the Sight at a distance; to neglect solid and
substantial Happiness, for what is showy and superficial; and to contemn
that Good which lies within their reach, for that which they are not
capable of attaining. Hope calculates its Schemes for a long and durable
Life; presses forward to imaginary Points of Bliss; and grasps at
Impossibilities; and consequently very often ensnares Men into Beggary,
Ruin and Dishonour.</p><p>What I have here said, may serve as a Moral to an _Arabian_ Fable, which
I find translated into _French_ by Monsieur _Galland_. [2]</p><p>The Fable has in it such a wild, but natural Simplicity, that I question
not but my Reader will be as much pleased with it as I have been, and
that he will consider himself, if he reflects on the several Amusements
of Hope which have sometimes passed in his Mind, as a near Relation to
the _Persian_ Glass-Man.</p><p>_Alnaschar_, says the Fable, was a very idle Fellow, that never would
set his Hand to any Business during his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec535.txt')">Father</a>'s Life. When his Father
died, he left him to the value of an hundred Drachmas in _Persian_
Mony. _Alnaschar_, in order to make the best of it, laid it out in
Glasses, Bottles, and the finest Earthen Ware. These he piled up in a
large open Basket, and having made choice of a very little Shop,
placed the Basket at his Feet, and leaned his Back upon the Wall, in
Expectation of Customers. As he sat in this Posture with his Eyes upon
the Basket, he fell into a most amusing Train of Thought, and was
over-heard by one of his Neighbours, as he talked to himself in the
following manner: _This Basket_, says he, _cost me at the Wholesale
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec535.txt')">Merchant</a>'s an Hundred Drachmas, which is all I have in the World. I
shall quickly make two hundred of it, by selling it in Retail. These
two hundred_ _Drachmas will in a very little while rise to four
Hundred, which of course will amount in time to four Thousand. Four
Thousand Drachmas cannot fail of making Eight Thousand. As soon as by
this means I am Master of Ten Thousand, I will lay aside my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec535.txt')">Trade</a> of a
Glass-Man, and turn Jeweller. I shall then deal in Diamonds, Pearls,
and all sorts of rich Stones. When I have got together as much Wealth
as I can well desire, I will make a Purchase of the finest House I can
find, with Lands, Slaves, Eunuchs and Horses. I shall then begin to
enjoy my self, and make a noise in the World. I will not, however,
stop there, but still continue my Traffick, till I have got together
an Hundred Thousand Drachmas. When I have thus made my self Master of
an hundred thousand Drachmas, I shall naturally set my self on the
foot of a Prince, and will demand the Grand _Visier's_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec535.txt')">Daughter</a> in
Marriage, after having represented to that Minister the Information
which I have received of the Beauty, Wit, Discretion, and other high
Qualities which his Daughter possesses. I will let him know at the
same time, that it is my Intention to make him a Present of a thousand
Pieces of Gold on our Marriage-Night. As soon as I have married the
Grand _Visier's_ Daughter, I'll buy her ten black Eunuchs, the
youngest and best that can be got for Mony. I must afterwards make my
Father-in-Law a Visit with a great Train and Equipage. And when I am
placed at his Right-hand, which he will do of course, if it be only to
Honour his Daughter, I will give him the thousand Pieces of Gold which
I promised him, and afterwards, to his great Surprize, will present
him another Purse of the same Value, with some short Speech; as,_ Sir,
you see I am a Man of my Word: I always give more than I promise.</p><p>_When I have brought the Princess to my House, I shall take particular
care to breed in her a due Respect for me, before I give the Reins to
Love and Dalliance. To this end I shall confine her to her own
Apartment, make her a short Visit, and talk but little to her. Her
Women will represent to me, that she is inconsolable by reason of my
Unkindness, and beg me with Tears to caress her, and let her sit down
by me; but I shall still remain inexorable, and will turn my Back upon
her all the first Night. Her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec535.txt')">Mother</a> will then come and bring her
Daughter to me, as I am seated upon my Sofa. The Daughter, with Tears
in her Eyes, will fling herself at my Feet, and beg of me to receive
her into my Favour: Then will I, to imprint in her a thorough
Veneration for my Person, draw up my Legs and spurn her from me with
my Foot, in such a manner that she shall fall down several Paces from
the Sofa.</p><p>Alnaschar_ was entirely swallowed up in this Chimerical Vision, and
could not forbear acting with his Foot what he had in his Thoughts: So
that unluckily striking his Basket of brittle Ware, which was the
Foundation of all his Grandeur, he kicked his Glasses to a great
distance from him into the Street, and broke them into ten thousand
Pieces.</p><p>
