<p>No. 537.             Saturday, November 15, 1712.             J. Hughes.</p><p></p><p>[Greek: Tou mèn gàr génos esmén--]</p><p></p><p>_To the_ SPECTATOR.</p><p>_SIR,_</p><p>'It has been usual to remind Persons of Rank, on <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec537.txt')">great</a> Occasions in
Life, of their Race and Quality, and to what Expectations they were
born; that by considering what is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec537.txt')">worthy</a> of them, they may be
withdrawn from mean Pursuits, and encouraged to laudable Undertakings.
This is turning Nobility into a Principle of <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec537.txt')">Virtue</a>, and making it
productive of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec537.txt')">Merit</a>, as it is understood to have been originally a
Reward of it.</p><p>'It is for the like <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec537.txt')">reason</a>, I imagine, that you have in some of your
Speculations asserted to your Readers the _Dignity of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec537.txt')">Human</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec537.txt')">Nature</a>_.
But you cannot be insensible that this is a controverted Doctrine;
there are <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec537.txt')">Authors</a> who consider Human Nature in a very different View,
and Books of Maxims have been written to shew the _Falsity of all
Human <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec537.txt')">Virtues</a>_. The Reflections which are made on this Subject usually
take some Tincture from the Tempers and Characters of those that make
them. Politicians can resolve the most shining <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec537.txt')">Actions</a> among Men into
Artifice and Design; others, who are soured by Discontent, Repulses,
or ill Usage, are apt to mistake their Spleen for Philosophy; Men of
profligate Lives, and such as find themselves incapable of rising to
any Distinction among their Fellow-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec537.txt')">Creatures</a>, are for pulling down all
Appearances of Merit, which seem to upbraid them: and Satirists
describe nothing but Deformity. From all these Hands we have such
Draughts of Mankind as are represented in those burlesque Pictures,
which the _Italians_ call _Caracatura's;_ where the Art consists in
preserving, amidst distorted Proportions and aggravated Features, some
distinguishing Likeness of the Person, but in such a manner as to
transform the most agreeable Beauty into the most odious Monster.</p><p>'It is very disingenuous to level the best of Mankind with the worst,
and for the Faults of Particulars to degrade the whole Species. Such
Methods tend not only to remove a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec537.txt')">Man</a>'s good Opinion of others, but to
destroy that Reverence for himself, which is a great Guard of
Innocence, and a Spring of Virtue.</p><p>'It is true indeed that there are surprizing Mixtures of Beauty and
Deformity, of Wisdom and Folly, Virtue and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec537.txt')">Vice</a>, in the Human Make;
such a Disparity is found among Numbers of the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec537.txt')">Kind</a>, and every
Individual, in some Instances, or at some Times, is so unequal to
himself, that _Man_ seems to be the most wavering and inconsistent
Being in the whole Creation. So that the Question in Morality,
concerning the Dignity of our Nature, may at first sight appear like
some difficult Questions in Natural Philosophy, in which the Arguments
on both Sides seem to be of equal Strength. But as I began with
considering this Point as it relates to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec537.txt')">Action</a>, I shall here borrow an
admirable Reflection from Monsieur _Pascal_, which I think sets it in
its proper Light.</p><p>'_It is of dangerous Consequence_, says he, _to represent to Man how
near he is to the Level of Beasts, without shewing him at the same
time his_ Greatness. _It is likewise dangerous to let him see his
Greatness, without his_ Meanness. _It is more dangerous yet to leave
him ignorant of either; but very beneficial that he should be made
sensible of both._ [1]</p><p>Whatever Imperfections we may have in our Nature, it is the Business
of Religion and Virtue to rectify them, as far as is consistent with
our present State. In the mean time, it is no small Encouragement to
generous Minds to consider that we shall put them all off with our
Mortality. That sublime Manner of Salutation with which the _Jews_
approached their Kings,</p><p>O King, _live for ever!_</p><p>may be addressed to the lowest and most despised Mortal among us,
under all the Infirmities and Distresses with which we see him
surrounded. And whoever believes the _Immortality of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec537.txt')">Soul</a>_, will
not need a better Argument for the Dignity of his Nature, nor a
stronger Incitement to Actions suitable to it.</p><p>'I am naturally led by this Reflection to a Subject I have already
touched upon in a former Letter, and cannot without pleasure call to
mind the Thoughts of _Cicero_ to this purpose, in the close of his
Book concerning _Old Age_. Every one who is acquainted with his
Writings, will remember that the elder _Cato_ is introduced in that
Discourse as the Speaker, and _Scipio_ and _Lelius_ as his Auditors.
This venerable Person is represented looking forward as it were from
the Verge of extreme Old Age, into a future State, and rising into a
Contemplation on the unperishable Part of his Nature, and its
Existence after <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec537.txt')">Death</a>. I shall collect Part of his Discourse. And as
you have formerly offered some Arguments for the Soul's Immortality,
agreeable both to Reason and the Christian Doctrine, I believe your
Readers will not be displeased to see how the same great Truth shines
in the Pomp of _Roman_ Eloquence.</p><p>"This, says _Cato_, my firm Persuasion, that since the human Soul
exerts it self with so great Activity, since it has such a
Remembrance of the Past, such a Concern for the Future, since it is
enriched with so many Arts, Sciences and Discoveries, it is
impossible but the Being which contains all these must be Immortal.</p><p>"The elder _Cyrus_, just before his Death, is represented by
XENOPHON speaking after this Manner."</p><p>'_Think not, my dearest Children, that when I depart from you I
shall be no more, but remember, that my Soul, even while I lived
among you, was invisible to you; yet by my Actions you were
sensible it existed in this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec537.txt')">Body</a>. Believe it therefore existing
still, though it be still unseen. How quickly would the Honours of
illustrious Men perish after Death, if their Souls performed
nothing to preserve their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec537.txt')">Fame</a>? For my own part, I never could
think that the Soul while in a mortal Body, lives, but when
departed out of it, dies; or that its Consciousness is lost when
it is discharged out of an unconscious Habitation. But when it is
freed from all corporeal Alliance, then it truly exists. Further,
since the Human Frame is broken by Death, tell us what becomes of
its Parts? It is visible whither the Materials of other Beings are
translated, namely to the Source from whence they had their Birth.
The Soul alone, neither present nor departed, is the Object of our
Eyes._' [2]</p><p>"Thus _Cyrus_. But to proceed. No one shall persuade me, _Scipio_,
that your worthy Father, or your Grandfathers _Paulus_ and
_Africanus_, or _Africanus_ his Father, or Uncle, or many other
excellent Men whom I need not name, performed so many Actions to be
remembered by Posterity, without being sensible that Futurity was
their Right. And, if I may be allowed an old Man's Privilege, to
speak of my self, do you think I would have endured the Fatigue of
so many wearisome Days and Nights both at home and abroad, if I
imagined that the same Boundary which is set to my Life must
terminate my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec537.txt')">Glory</a>? Were it not more desirable to have worn out my
days in Ease and Tranquility, free from Labour, and without
Emulation? But I know not how, my Soul has always raised it self,
and looked forward on Futurity, in this View and Expectation, that
when it shall depart out of Life, it shall then live for ever; and
if this were not true, that the Mind is immortal, the Souls of the
most worthy would not, above all others, have the strongest Impulse
to Glory.</p><p>"What besides this is the Cause that the wisest Men die with the
greatest Æquanimity, the ignorant with the greatest Concern? Does it
not seem that those Minds which have the most extensive Views,
foresee they are removing to a happier Condition, which those of a
narrower Sight do not perceive? I, for my part, am transported with
the Hope of seeing your Ancestors, whom I have honoured and loved,
and am earnestly desirous of meeting not only those excellent
Persons whom I have known, but those too of whom I have heard and
read, and of whom I myself have written: nor would I be detained
from so pleasing a Journey. O happy Day, when I shall escape from
this Croud, this Heap of Pollution, and be admitted to that Divine
Assembly of exalted Spirits! When I shall go not only to those great
Persons I have named, but to my _Cato_, my Son, than whom a better
Man was never born, and whose Funeral Rites I my self performed,
whereas he ought rather to have attended mine. Yet has not his Soul
deserted me, but, seeming to cast back a Look on me, is gone before
to those Habitations to which it was sensible I should follow him.
And though I might appear to have born my Loss with Courage, I was
not unaffected with it, but I comforted myself in the Assurance that
it would not be long before we should meet again, and be divorced no
more.</p><p>_I am, SIR, &c._"'</p><p>
_I question not but my Reader will be very much pleased to hear, that
the Gentleman who has obliged the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec537.txt')">World</a> with the foregoing Letter, and
who was the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec537.txt')">Author</a> of the 210th Speculation on the Immortality of the
Soul, [the 375th on Virtue in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec537.txt')">Distress</a>,] the 525th on Conjugal Love, and
two or three other very fine ones among those which are not lettered at
the end, will soon publish a noble Poem, Intitled_ An Ode to the Creator
of the World, _occasioned by the Fragments of_ Orpheus.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: _Pensées_. Part I. Art. iv. 7.]</p><p>
