<p>No. 539.             Tuesday, November 18, 1712.                Budgell.</p><p></p><p>'Heteroclyta sunto.--Qu√¶ Genus.'</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I am a young Widow of a good Fortune and Family, and just come to
Town; where I find I have Clusters of pretty Fellows come already to
visit me, some dying with Hopes, others with Fears, tho' they never
saw me. Now what I would beg of you, would be to know whether I may
venture to use these pert Fellows with the same Freedom as I did my
Country Acquaintance. I desire your Leave to use them as to me shall
seem meet, without Imputation of a Jilt; for since I make Declaration
that not one of them shall have me, I think I ought to be allowed the
Liberty of insulting those who have the Vanity to believe it is in
their power to make me break that Resolution. There are Schools for
learning to use Foils, frequented by those who never design to fight;
and this useless way of aiming at the Heart, without design to wound
it on either side, is the Play with which I am resolved to divert my
self: The Man who pretends to win, I shall use like him who comes into
a Fencing-School to pick a Quarrel. I hope, upon this Foundation, you
will give me the free use of the natural and artificial Force of my
Eyes, Looks, and Gestures. As for verbal Promises, I will make none,
but shall have no mercy on the conceited Interpreters of Glances and
Motions. I am particularly skill'd in the downcast Eye, and the
Recovery into a sudden full Aspect, and away again, as you may have
seen sometimes practised by us Country Beauties beyond all that you
have observed in Courts and Cities. Add to this, Sir, that I have a
ruddy heedless Look, which covers Artifice the best of any thing. Tho'
I can dance very well, I affect a tottering untaught way of walking,
by which I appear an easy Prey and never exert my instructed Charms
till I find I have engaged a Pursuer. Be pleased, Sir, to print this
Letter; which will certainly begin the Chace of a rich Widow: The many
Foldings, Escapes, Returns and Doublings which I make, I shall from
time to time communicate to you, for the better Instruction of all
Females who set up, like me, for reducing the present exorbitant Power
and Insolence of Man.'</p><p>_I am, SIR,</p><p>Your faithful Correspondent_,</p><p>Relicta Lovely.</p><p></p><p>_<a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec539.txt')">Dear</a> Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I depend upon your profess'd <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec539.txt')">Respect</a> for virtuous <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec539.txt')">Love</a>, for your
immediate answering the Design of this Letter; which is no other than
to lay before the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec539.txt')">World</a> the Severity of certain Parents who desire to
suspend the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec539.txt')">Marriage</a> of a discreet young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec539.txt')">Woman</a> of eighteen, three
Years longer, for no other reason but that of her being too young to
enter into that State. As to the consideration of Riches, my
Circumstances are such, that I cannot be suspected to make my
Addresses to her on such low Motives as Avarice or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec539.txt')">Ambition</a>. If ever
Innocence, Wit and Beauty, united their utmost Charms, they have in
her. I wish you would expatiate a little on this Subject, and admonish
her Parents that it may be from the very Imperfection of Human Nature
it self, and not any personal Frailty of her or me, that our
Inclinations baffled at present may alter; and while we are arguing
with our selves to put off the Enjoyment of our present Passions, our
Affections may change their Objects in the Operation. It is a very
delicate Subject to talk upon; but if it were but hinted, I am in
hopes it would give the Parties concern'd some Reflection that might
expedite our Happiness. There is a Possibility, and I hope I may say
it without Imputation of Immodesty to her I love with the highest
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec539.txt')">Honour</a>; I say, there is a Possibility this Delay may be as painful to
her as it is to me. If it be as much, it must be more, by reason of
the severe Rules the Sex are under in being denied even the Relief of
Complaint. If you oblige me in this, and I succeed, I promise you a
Place at my Wedding, and a Treatment suitable to your Spectatorial
Dignity.'</p><p>_Your most humble Servant_,</p><p>Eustace.</p><p></p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>'I Yesterday heard a young Gentleman, that look'd as if he was just
come to the Town, and a Scarf, upon Evil-speaking; which Subject, you
know, Archbishop _Tillotson_ has so nobly handled in a Sermon in his
_Folio_. As soon as ever he had named his Text, and had opened a
little the Drift of his Discourse, I was in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec539.txt')">great</a> hopes he had been
one of Sir ROGER'S Chaplains. I have conceived so great an Idea of the
charming Discourse above, that I should have thought one part of my
Sabbath very well spent in hearing a Repetition of it. But alas! Mr.
SPECTATOR, this Reverend Divine gave us his Grace's Sermon, and yet I
don't know how; even I, that I am sure have read it at least twenty
times, could not tell what to make of it, and was at a loss sometimes
to guess what the Man aim'd at. He was so just indeed, as to give us
all the Heads and the Sub-divisions of the Sermon; and farther I think
there was not one beautiful Thought in it but what we had. But then,
Sir, this Gentleman made so many pretty Additions; and he could never
give us a Paragraph of the Sermon, but he introduced it with something
which, methought, look'd more like a Design to shew his own Ingenuity,
than to instruct the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec539.txt')">People</a>. In short, he added and curtailed in such
a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec539.txt')">manner</a> that he vexed me; insomuch that I could not forbear thinking
(what, I confess, I ought not to have thought of in so holy a Place)
that this young Spark was as justly blameable as _Bullock_ or
_Penkethman_ when they mend a noble Play of _Shakespear_ or _Johnson_.
Pray, Sir, take this into your Consideration; and if we must be
entertained with the Works of any of those great Men, desire these
Gentlemen to give them us as they find them, that so, when we read
them to our Families at home, they may the better remember they have
heard them at Church.'</p><p>_SIR,</p><p>Your humble Servant_.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
