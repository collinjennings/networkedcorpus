<p>No. 540.               Wednesday, November 19, 1712.            Steele.</p><p></p><p>'--Non Deficit Alter--'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'There is no Part of your Writings which I have in more Esteem than
your Criticism upon _<a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec540.txt')">Milton</a>_. It is an honourable and candid Endeavour
to set the Works of our Noble <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec540.txt')">Writers</a> in the graceful Light which they
deserve. You will lose much of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec540.txt')">kind</a> Inclination towards you, if you
do not attempt the Encomium of _Spencer_ also, or at least indulge my
Passion for that charming <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec540.txt')">Author</a> so far as to print the loose Hints I
now give you on that Subject.</p><p>'Spencer's general Plan is the Representation of six Virtues,
Holiness, Temperance, Chastity, Friendship, Justice and Courtesy, in
six Legends by six Persons. The six Personages are supposed under
proper Allegories suitable to their respective Characters, to do all
that is necessary for the full Manifestation of the respective Virtues
which they are to exert.</p><p>'These one might undertake to shew under the several <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec540.txt')">Heads</a>, are
admirably drawn; no Images improper, and most surprizingly <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec540.txt')">beautiful</a>.
The Red-cross Knight runs through the whole Steps of the Christian
Life; _Guyon_ does all that Temperance can possibly require;
_Britomartis_ (a Woman) observes the true Rules of unaffected
Chastity; _Arthegal_ is in every <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec540.txt')">Respect</a> of Life strictly and wisely
just; _Calidore_ is rightly courteous.</p><p>'In short, in _Fairy-Land_, where Knights Errant have a full Scope to
range, and to do even what _Ariosto's_ or _Orlando's_ could not do in
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec540.txt')">World</a> without breaking into Credibility, _Spencer's_ Knights have,
under those six Heads, given a full and a truly Poetical System of
Christian, Public, and Low Life.</p><p>'His Legend of Friendship is more diffuse, and yet even there the
Allegory is finely drawn, only the Heads various, one Knight could not
there support all the Parts.</p><p>'To do <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec540.txt')">honour</a> to his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec540.txt')">Country</a>, Prince _Arthur_ is an Universal Hero; in
Holiness, Temperance, Chastity, and Justice super-excellent. For the
same Reason, and to compliment Queen _Elizabeth_, _Gloriana_, Queen of
Fairies, whose Court was the Asylum of the Oppressed, represents that
Glorious Queen. At her Commands all these Knights set forth, and only
at her's the Red-cross Knight destroys the Dragon. _Guyon_ overturns
the Bower of Bliss, _Arthegal_ (i. e. _Justice_) beats down _Geryoneo_
(i. e. _Phil._ II. King of _Spain_) to rescue _Belge_ (i. e.
_Holland_) and he beats the _Grantorto_ (the same _Philip_ in another
Light) to restore _Irena_ (i. e. _Peace_ to Europe.)</p><p>'Chastity being the first Female Virtue, _Britomartis_ is a _Britain_;
her Part is fine, though it requires Explication. His stile is very
Poetical; no Puns, Affectations of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec540.txt')">Wit</a>, forced Antitheses, or any of
that low Tribe.</p><p>'His old <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec540.txt')">Words</a> are all true _English_, and numbers exquisite; and
since of Words there is the _Multa Renascentur_, since they are all
proper, such a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec540.txt')">Poem</a> should not (any more than _Milton's_) subsist all
of it of common ordinary Words. See Instances of Descriptions.</p><p>'Causeless Jealousy in _Britomartis_, V. 6, 14, in its Restlessness.</p><p>'Like as a wayward Child whose sounder Sleep
Is broken with some fearful Dream's Affright,
With froward Will doth set himself to weep,
Ne can be stil'd for all his Nurse's Might,
But kicks, and squalls, and shrieks for fell Despight;
Now scratching her, and her loose Locks misusing,
Now seeking Darkness, and now seeking Light;
Then craving Suck, and then the Suck refusing:
Such was this Lady's Loves in her Love's fond accusing.'</p><p>Curiosity occasioned by Jealousy, upon occasion of her Lover's
Absence. _Ibid, Stan_. 8, 9.</p><p>'Then as she looked long, at last she spy'd
One coming towards her with hasty Speed,
Well ween'd she then, e'er him she plain descry'd,
That it was one sent from her Love indeed;
Whereat her Heart was fill'd with Hope and Dread,
Ne would she stay till he in Place could come,
But ran to weet him forth to know his Tidings somme;
Even in the Door him meeting, she begun,
And where is he, thy Lord, and how far hence?
Declare at once; and hath he lost or won?'</p><p>_Care_ and his _House_ are described thus, IV. 6, 33, 34, 35.</p><p>'Not far away, not meet for any Guest,
They spy'd a little Cottage, like some poor Man's Nest.'</p><p>
34.</p><p>'There entring in, they found the Good-Man's self,
Full busily unto his Work ybent,
Who was so weel a wretched wearish Elf,
With hollow Eyes and raw-bone Cheeks forspent,
As if he had in Prison long been pent.
Full <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec540.txt')">black</a> and griesly did his Face appear,
Besmear'd with Smoke that nigh his Eye-sight blent,
With rugged Beard and Hoary shaggy Heare,
The which he never wont to comb, or comely shear.'</p><p>
35.</p><p>'Rude was his Garment and to Rags all rent,
Ne better had he, ne for better cared;
His blistred Hands amongst the Cinders brent,
And Fingers filthy, with long Nails prepared,
Right fit to rend the Food on which he fared.
His Name was_ Care; _a Blacksmith by his Trade,
That neither Day nor Night from working spared,
But to small purpose Iron Wedges made:
These be unquiet Thoughts that careful Minds invade.'</p><p>'<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec540.txt')">Homer</a>'s Epithets were much admired by Antiquity: See what <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec540.txt')">great</a>
Justness and Variety there is in these Epithets of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec540.txt')">Trees</a> in the
Forest where the Red-cross Knight lost _Truth_, B. I. Cant. i. St. 8,
9.</p><p>'The sailing Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,
The Vine-prop Elm, the Poplar never dry,
The Builder Oak, sole King of Forests all.
The Aspine good for Staves, the Cypress Funeral.
The Laurel, Meed of mighty Conquerors,
And Poets sage; the Fir that weepeth still,
The Willow worn of forlorn Paramours,
The Yew obedient to the Bender's Will.
The Birch for Shafts, the Sallow for the Mill;
The Myrrhe <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec540.txt')">sweet</a> bleeding in the bitter Wound,
The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,
The fruitful Olive, and the Plantane <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec540.txt')">round</a>,
The Carver Helm, the Maple seldom inward sound.'</p><p>'I shall trouble you no more, but desire you to let me conclude with
these Verses, though I think they have already been quoted by you;
They are Directions to young Ladies opprest with Calumny. VI. 6, 14.</p><p>'The best_ (said he) _that I can you advise,
Is to avoid the Occasion of the Ill;
For when the Cause whence Evil doth arise
Removed is, the Effect surceaseth still.
Abstain from Pleasure, and restrain your Will,
Subdue Desire, and bridle loose Delight,
Use scanted Diet, and forbear your Fill,
Shun Secrecy, and talk in open Sight;
So shall you soon repair your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec540.txt')">present</a> evil Plight.'</p><p>
