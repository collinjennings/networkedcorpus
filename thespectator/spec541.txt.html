<p>No. 541.             Thursday, November 20, 1712.           John Hughes.</p><p></p><p>'Format enim Natura prius nos intus ad omnem
Fortunarum habitum; juvat, aut impellit ad iram,
Aut ad humum m√¶rore gravi deducit et angit;
Post effert animi motus interprete Lingua.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>My Friend the _Templar_, whom I have so often mentioned in these
Writings, having determined to lay aside his Poetical Studies, in order
to a closer Pursuit of the Law, has put together, as a Farewell Essay,
some Thoughts concerning [_Pronunciation_ and _<a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec541.txt')">Action</a>_, [1]] which he
has given me leave to communicate to the Publick. They are chiefly
collected from his Favourite <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec541.txt')">Author</a>, _Cicero_, who is known to have been
an intimate Friend of _Rostius_ the Actor, and a good Judge of
[Dramatick [2]] Performances, as well as the most Eloquent Pleader of
the Time in which he lived.</p><p>Cicero concludes his celebrated Books _de Oratore_ with some Precepts
for Pronunciation and Action, without which <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec541.txt')">Part</a> he affirms that the
best Orator in the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec541.txt')">World</a> can never succeed; and an indifferent one, who
is Master of this, shall gain much greater Applause. What could make a
stronger Impression, says he, than those Exclamations of _Gracchus_:</p><p>'Whither shall I turn? Wretch that I am! To what Place betake my self?
Shall I go to the_ Capitol?--_Alas! it is overflowed with my Brother's
Blood. Or shall I retire to my <a name="topic47" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec541.txt')">House</a>? Yet there I behold my Mother
plung'd in Misery, weeping and despairing!'</p><p>These Breaks and Turns of Passion, it seems, were so enforced by the
Eyes, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec541.txt')">Voice</a>, and Gesture of the Speaker, that his very Enemies could not
refrain from <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec541.txt')">Tears</a>. I insist, says _Tully_, upon this the rather,
because our Orators, who are as it were <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec541.txt')">Actors</a> of the Truth it self,
have quitted this manner of speaking; and the Players, who are but the
Imitators of Truth, have taken it up.</p><p>I shall therefore pursue the Hint he has here given me, and for the
Service of the _British <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec541.txt')">Stage</a>_ I shall copy some of the Rules which this
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec541.txt')">great</a> _Roman_ Master has laid down; yet, without confining my self
wholly to his Thoughts or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec541.txt')">Words</a>: and to adapt this Essay the more to the
Purpose for which I intend it, instead of the Examples he has inserted
in his Discourse, out of the ancient Tragedies, I shall make use of
parallel Passages out of the most celebrated of our own.</p><p>The Design of Art is to assist Action as much as possible in the
Representation of Nature; for the Appearance of Reality is that which
moves us in all Representations, and these have always the greater
Force, the nearer they approach to Nature, and the less they shew of
Imitation.</p><p>Nature herself has assigned to every Emotion of the Soul, its peculiar
Cast of the Countenance, Tone of Voice, and Manner of Gesture; and the
whole Person, all the Features of the Face and Tones of the Voice,
answer, like Strings upon musical Instruments, to the Impressions made
on them by the Mind. Thus the Sounds of the Voice, according to the
various Touches which raise them, form themselves into an Acute or
Grave, Quick or Slow, Loud or Soft Tone. These too may be subdivided
into various kinds of Tones, as the gentle, the rough, the contracted,
the diffuse, the continued, the intermitted, the broken, abrupt,
winding, softned, or elevated. Every one of these may be employed with
Art and Judgment; and all supply the Actor, as Colours do the Painter,
with an expressive Variety.</p><p>Anger exerts its peculiar Voice in an acute, raised, and hurrying sound.
The passionate Character of _King Lear_, as it is admirably drawn by
_Shakespear_, abounds with the strongest Instances of this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec541.txt')">kind</a>.</p><p>'--<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec541.txt')">Death</a>! Confusion!
Fiery!--what Quality?--why_ Gloster! Gloster!
I'd speak with the Duke of_ Cornwall _and his Wife.
Are they informed of this? My Breath and Blood!
Fiery? the fiery Duke?--&c.'</p><p><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec541.txt')">Sorrow</a> and Complaint demand a Voice quite different, flexible, slow,
interrupted, and modulated in a mournful Tone; as in that pathetical
Soliloquy of Cardinal _Wolsey_ on his Fall.</p><p>'Farewel!--a long Farewel to all my Greatness!
This is the State of Man!--to-day he puts forth
The tender Leaves of Hopes; to-morrow Blossoms,
And bears his blushing Honours thick upon him,
The third Day comes a Frost, a killing Frost,
And when he thinks, good easie Man, full surely
His Greatness is a ripening, nips his Root,
And then he falls as I do.'</p><p>We have likewise a fine Example of this in the whole Part of
_Andromache_ in the 'Distrest-Mother', particularly in these Lines.</p><p>'I'll go, and in the Anguish of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec541.txt')">Heart</a>
Weep o'er my Child--If he must die, my Life
Is wrapt in his, I shall not long survive.
'Tis for his sake that I have suffer'd Life,
Groan'd in Captivity, and out-liv'd Hector.
Yes, my_ Astyanax, _we'll go together!
Together to the Realms of Night we'll go;     }
There to thy ravish'd Eyes thy Sire I'll <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec541.txt')">show</a>,}
And point him out among the Shades below.'    }</p><p><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec541.txt')">Fear</a> expresses it self in a low, hesitating and abject Sound. If the
Reader considers the following Speech of _Lady Macbeth_, while her
husband is about the Murder of _Duncan_ and his Grooms, he will imagine
her even affrighted with the Sound of her own Voice, while she is
speaking it.</p><p>'Alas! I am afraid they have awak'd,
And 'tis not done; th' Attempt, and not the Deed,
Confounds us--Hark!--I laid the Daggers ready,
He could not miss them. Had he not resembled
My Father as he slept, I had done it.'</p><p>Courage assumes a louder tone, as in that Speech of Don _Sebastian_. [3]</p><p>'Here satiate all your Fury:
Let Fortune empty her whole Quiver on me,
I have a Soul that like an ample Shield
Can take in all, and Verge enough for more.'</p><p>Pleasure dissolves into a luxurious, mild, tender, and joyous
Modulation; as in the following Lines in 'Caius Marius'. [4]</p><p>'_Lavinia! _O there's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec541.txt')">Musick</a> in the Name,
That softning me to infant Tenderness,
Makes my Heart spring, like the first Leaps of Life.'</p><p>And Perplexity is different from all these; grave, but not bemoaning,
with an earnest uniform Sound of Voice; as in that celebrated Speech of
_Hamlet_.</p><p>'To be, or not to be?--that is the Question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the Mind to suffer
The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,
Or to take Arms against a Sea of Troubles,
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep;
No more; and by a Sleep to say we end
The Heart-ach, and the thousand natural Shocks
That Flesh is Heir to; 'tis a Consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep--
To sleep; perchance to dream! Ay, there's the Rub.
For in that sleep of Death what Dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this Mortal Coil,
Must give us pause--There's the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec541.txt')">Respect</a>
That makes Calamity of so long Life;
For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of Time,
Th' Oppressor's Wrongs, the proud Man's contumely,
The Pangs of despis'd Love, the Law's Delay,
The Insolence of Office, and the Spurns
That patient <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec541.txt')">Merit</a> of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his Quietus make
With a bare Bodkin? Who would Fardles bear,
To groan and sweat under a weary Life?
But that the Dread of something after Death,
The undiscover'd Country, from whose Bourn
No Traveller returns, puzzles the Will,
And makes us rather chuse those Ills we have,
Than fly to others that--we know not of.'</p><p>As all these Varieties of Voice are to be directed by the Sense, so the
Action is to be directed by the Voice, and with a beautiful Propriety,
as it were to enforce it. The Arm, which by a strong Figure _Tully_
calls _The Orator's Weapon_, is to be sometimes raised and extended; and
the Hand, by its Motion, sometimes to lead, and sometimes to follow the
Words, as they are uttered. The Stamping of the Foot too has its proper
Expression in Contention, Anger, or absolute Command. But the Face is
the Epitome of the whole Man, and the Eyes are as it were the Epitome of
the Face; for which Reason, he says, the best Judges among the _Romans_
were not extremely pleased, even with _Roscius_ himself in his Masque.
No Part of the Body, besides the Face, is capable of as many Changes as
there are different Emotions in the Mind, and of expressing them all by
those Changes. Nor is this to be done without the Freedom of the Eyes;
therefore _Theophrastus_ call'd one, who barely rehearsed his Speech
with his Eyes fix'd, an _absent Actor_.</p><p>As the Countenance admits of so great Variety, it requires also great
Judgment to govern it. Not that the Form of the Face is to be shifted on
every Occasion, lest it turn to Farce and Buffoonery; but it is certain
that the Eyes have a wonderful Power of marking the Emotions of the
Mind, sometimes by a stedfast Look, sometimes by a careless one, now by
a sudden Regard, then by a joyful Sparkling, as the Sense of the Words
is diversified: for Action is, as it were, the Speech of the Features
and Limbs, and must therefore conform itself always to the Sentiments of
the Soul. And it may be observed, that in all which relates to the
Gesture, there is a wonderful Force implanted by Nature, since the
Vulgar, the Unskilful, and even the most Barbarous are chiefly affected
by this. None are moved by the Sound of Words, but those who understand
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec541.txt')">Language</a>; and the Sense of many <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec541.txt')">things</a> is lost upon Men of a dull
Apprehension: but Action is a kind of Universal Tongue; all Men are
subject to the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec541.txt')">Passions</a>, and consequently know the same Marks of
them in others, by which they themselves express them.</p><p>Perhaps some of my Readers may be of Opinion, that the Hints I have here
made use of, out of _Cicero_, are somewhat too refined for the Players
on our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec541.txt')">Theatre</a>: In answer to which, I venture to lay it down as a Maxim,
that without Good Sense no one can be a good Player, and that he is very
unfit to personate the Dignity of a _Roman_ Hero, who cannot enter into
the Rules for Pronunciation and Gesture delivered by a _Roman_ Orator.</p><p>There is another thing which my Author does not think too minute to
insist on, though it is purely mechanical: and that is the right
_pitching_ of the Voice. On this occasion he tells the Story of
_Gracchus_, who employed a Servant with a little Ivory Pipe to stand
behind him, and give him the right Pitch, as often as he wandered too
far from the proper Modulation. Every Voice, says _Tully_, [5] has its
particular Medium and Compass, and the Sweetness of Speech consists in
leading it through all the Variety of Tones naturally, and without
touching any Extreme. Therefore, says he,</p><p>'Leave the Pipe at home, but carry the Sense of this Custom with you.'</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Action_ and _Pronunciation.]</p><p>
