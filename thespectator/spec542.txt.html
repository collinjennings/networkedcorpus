<p>No. 542.               Friday, November 21, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Et sibi pr√¶ferri se gaudet.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>When I have been present in Assemblies where my Paper has been talked
of, I have been very well pleased to hear those who would detract from
the <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec542.txt')">Author</a> of it observe, that the Letters which are sent to the
_Spectator_ are as good, if not better than any of his Works. Upon this
Occasion many Letters of Mirth are usually mentioned, which some think
the _Spectator_ writ to himself, and which others commend because they
fancy he received them from his Correspondents: Such are those from the
_Valetudinarian;_ the Inspector of the Sign-Posts; the Master of the
Fan-Exercise: with that of the Hoop'd Petticoat; that of _Nicholas Hart_
the annual Sleeper; that from Sir _John Envill;_ that upon the _London_
Cries; with multitudes of the same nature. As I love nothing more than
to mortify the Ill-natured, that I may do it effectually, I must
acquaint them, they have very often praised me when they did not design
it, and that they have approved my Writings when they thought they had
derogated from them. I have heard several of these unhappy Gentlemen
proving, by undeniable Arguments, that I was not able to pen a Letter
which I had written the Day before. Nay, I have heard some of them
throwing out ambiguous Expressions, and giving the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec542.txt')">Company</a> reason to
suspect that they themselves did me the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec542.txt')">Honour</a> to send me such or such a
particular Epistle, which happened to be talked of with the Esteem or
Approbation of those who were present. These rigid Criticks are so
afraid of allowing me any thing which does not belong to me, that they
will not be positive whether the Lion, the wild Boar, and the
Flower-pots in the Play-house, did not actually write those Letters
which came to me in their Names. I must therefore inform these
Gentlemen, that I often chuse this way of casting my Thoughts into a
Letter, for the following Reasons; First, out of the Policy of those who
try their Jest upon another, before they own it themselves. Secondly,
because I would extort a little Praise from such who will never applaud
any thing whose Author is known and certain. Thirdly, because it gave me
an Opportunity of introducing a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec542.txt')">great</a> variety of Characters into my
Work, which could not have been done, had I always written in the Person
of the _Spectator_. Fourthly, because the Dignity Spectatorial would
have suffered, had I published as from my self those several ludicrous
Compositions which I have ascribed to fictitious Names and Characters.
And lastly, because they often serve to bring in, more naturally, such
additional Reflections as have been placed at the End of them.</p><p>There are others who have likewise done me a very particular Honour,
though undesignedly. These are such who will needs have it, that I have
translated or borrowed many of my Thoughts out of Books which are
written in other Languages. I have heard of a Person, who is more famous
for his Library than his Learning, that has asserted this more than once
in his private <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec542.txt')">Conversation</a>. Were it true, I am sure he could not <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec542.txt')">speak</a>
it from his own Knowledge; but had he read the Books which he has
collected, he would find this Accusation to be wholly groundless. Those
who are truly learned will acquit me in this Point, in which I have been
so far from offending, that I have been scrupulous perhaps to a Fault in
quoting the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec542.txt')">Authors</a> of several Passages which I might have made my own.
But as this Assertion is in reality an Encomium on what I have
published, I ought rather to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec542.txt')">glory</a> in it, than endeavour to confute it.</p><p>Some are so very willing to alienate from me that small Reputation which
might accrue to me from any of these my Speculations, that they
attribute some of the best of them to those imaginary Manuscripts with
which I have introduced them. There are others, I must confess, whose
Objections have given me a greater Concern, as they seem to reflect,
under this Head, rather on my Morality than on my Invention. These are
they who say an Author is guilty of Falshood, when he talks to the
Publick of Manuscripts which he never saw, or describes Scenes of Action
or Discourse in which he was never engaged. But these Gentlemen would do
well to consider, there is not a Fable or Parable which ever was made
use of, that is not liable to this Exception; since nothing; according
to this Notion, can be related innocently, which was not once Matter of
Fact. Besides, I think the most ordinary Reader may be able to discover,
by my way of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec542.txt')">writing</a>, what I deliver in these Occurrences as Truth, and
what as Fiction.</p><p>Since I am unawares engaged in answering the several Objections which
have been made against these my Works, I must take Notice that there are
some who affirm a Paper of this Nature should always turn upon diverting
Subjects, and others who find Fault with every one of them that hath not
an immediate Tendency to the Advancement of Religion or Learning. I
shall leave these Gentlemen to dispute it out among themselves; since I
see one half of my Conduct patronized by each side. Were I serious on an
improper Subject, or trifling in a serious one, I should deservedly draw
upon me the Censure of my Readers; or were I conscious of any thing in
my Writings that is not innocent at least, or that the greatest part of
them were not sincerely designed to discountenance Vice and Ignorance,
and support the Interest of true Wisdom and Virtue, I should be more
severe upon my self than the Publick is disposed to be. In the mean
while I desire my Reader to consider every particular Paper or Discourse
as a distinct Tract by itself, and independent of every thing that goes
before or after it.</p><p>I shall end this Paper with the following Letter, which was really sent
me, as some others have been which I have published, and for which I
must own my self indebted to their respective <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec542.txt')">Writers</a>.</p><p>
SIR,</p><p>I was this Morning in a Company of your Well-wishers, when we read
over, with great Satisfaction, _Tully's_ Observations on Action
adapted to the _British_ Theatre: Though, by the way, we were very
sorry to find that you have disposed of another Member of your Club.
Poor Sir _Roger_ is dead, and the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec542.txt')">worthy</a> Clergyman dying. Captain
_Sentry_ has taken Possession of a fair Estate; _Will. Honeycomb_ has
married a Farmer's Daughter; and the _Templar_ withdraws himself into
the Business of his own Profession. What will all this end in? We are
afraid it portends no Good to the Publick. Unless you very speedily
fix a Day for the Election of new Members, we are under Apprehensions
of losing the _British Spectator_. I hear of a Party of Ladies who
intend to address you on this Subject, and question not, if you do not
give us the Slip very suddenly, that you will receive Addresses from
all Parts of the Kingdom to continue so useful a Work. Pray deliver us
out of this Perplexity, and among the Multitude of your Readers you
will particularly oblige</p><p>_Your most Sincere <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec542.txt')">Friend</a> and Servant,_</p><p>Philo-Spec.</p><p>
O.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
