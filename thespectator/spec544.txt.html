<p>No. 544.             Monday, November 24, 1712.                 Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Nunquam ita quisquam bene subducta ratione ad vitam fuit
Quia res, Ætas usus semper aliquid apportet novi
Aliquid moneat, ut illa, quæ te scire credas, nescias
Et, quæ tibi putaris prima, in experiundo ut repudies.'</p><p>Ter.</p><p></p><p>There are, I think, Sentiments in the following Letter from my <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec544.txt')">Friend</a>
Captain SENTRY, which discover a rational and equal Frame of Mind, as
well prepared for an advantageous as an unfortunate Change of Condition.</p><p></p><p>_Coverley-Hall, Nov._ 15, _Worcestershire._</p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>'I am come to the Succession of the <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec544.txt')">Estate</a> of my honoured Kinsman Sir
ROGER DE COVERLEY; and I assure you I find it no easy Task to keep up
the Figure of Master of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec544.txt')">Fortune</a> which was so handsomely enjoyed by
that honest plain Man. I cannot (with <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec544.txt')">respect</a> to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec544.txt')">great</a> Obligations
I have, be it spoken) reflect upon his Character, but I am confirmed
in the Truth which I have, I think, heard spoken at the Club, to wit,
That a Man of a warm and well-disposed Heart with a very small
Capacity, is highly superior in human Society to him who with the
greatest Talents is cold and languid in his Affections. But, alas! why
do I make a difficulty in speaking of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec544.txt')">worthy</a> Ancestor's Failings?
His little Absurdities and Incapacity for the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec544.txt')">Conversation</a> of the
politest Men are dead with him, and his greater Qualities are even now
useful to him. I know not whether by naming those Disabilities I do
not enhance his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec544.txt')">Merit</a>, since he has left behind him a Reputation in
his Country which would be worth the Pains of the wisest Man's whole
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec544.txt')">Life</a> to arrive at. By the way I must observe to you, that many of your
Readers have mistook that Passage in your Writings, wherein Sir ROGER
is reported to have enquired into the private Character of the young
Woman at the Tavern. I know you mentioned that Circumstance as an
Instance of the Simplicity and Innocence of his Mind, which made him
imagine it a very easy thing to reclaim one of those Criminals, and
not as an Inclination in him to be guilty with her. The less
discerning of your Readers cannot enter into that Delicacy of
Description in the Character: But indeed my chief Business at this
time is to represent to you my present State of Mind, and the
Satisfactions I promise to my self in the Possession of my new
Fortune. I have continued all Sir ROGER'S Servants, except such as it
was a Relief to dismiss into little Beings within my Manor: Those who
are in a List of the good Knight's own Hand to be taken care of by me,
I have quartered upon such as have taken new Leases of me, and added
so many Advantages during the Lives of the Persons so quartered, that
it is the Interest of those whom they are joined with, to cherish and
befriend them upon all Occasions. I find a considerable Sum of ready
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec544.txt')">Money</a>, which I am laying out among my Dependants at the common
Interest, but with a Design to lend it according to their Merit,
rather than according to their Ability. I shall lay a Tax upon such as
I have highly obliged, to become Security to me for such of their own
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec544.txt')">poor</a> Youth, whether Male or Female, as want Help towards getting into
some Being in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec544.txt')">World</a>. I hope I shall be able to manage my Affairs
so, as to improve my Fortune every Year, by doing Acts of Kindness. I
will lend my Money to the Use of none but indigent Men, secured by
such as have ceased to be indigent by the Favour of my Family or my
self. What makes this the more practicable, is, that if they will do
any one Good with my Money, they are welcome to it upon their own
Security: And I make no Exception against it, because the Persons who
enter into the Obligations, do it for their own Family. I have laid
out four thousand Pounds this way, and it is not to be imagined what a
Crowd of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec544.txt')">People</a> are obliged by it. In Cases where Sir ROGER has
recommended, I have lent Money to put out Children, with a Clause
which makes void the Obligation, in case the Infant dies before he is
out of his Apprenticeship; by which means the Kindred and Masters are
extremely careful of breeding him to Industry, that he may repay it
himself by his Labour, in three Years Journeywork after his Time is
out, for the Use of his Securities. Opportunities of this kind are all
that have occurred since I came to my Estate; but I assure you I will
preserve a constant Disposition to catch at all the Occasions I can to
promote the Good and Happiness of my Neighbourhood.</p><p>'But give me leave to lay before you a little Establishment which has
grown out of my past Life, that I doubt not, will administer great
Satisfaction to me in that Part of it, whatever that is, which is to
come.</p><p>'There is a Prejudice in favour of the Way of Life to which a Man has
been educated, which I know not whether it would not be faulty to
overcome: It is like a Partiality to the Interest of one's own Country
before that of any other Nation. It is from an Habit of Thinking,
grown upon me from my Youth spent in Arms, that I have ever held
Gentlemen, who have preserved Modesty, Good-nature, Justice, and
Humanity in a Soldier's Life, to be the most valuable and worthy
Persons of the human Race. To pass through imminent Dangers, suffer
painful Watchings, frightful Alarms, and laborious Marches for the
greater part of a Man's Time, and pass the rest in a Sobriety
conformable to the Rules of the most virtuous civil Life, is a Merit
too great to deserve the Treatment it usually meets with among the
other part of the World. But I assure you, Sir, were there not very
many who have this Worth, we could never have seen the glorious Events
which we have in our Days. I need not say more to illustrate the
Character of a Soldier, than to tell you he is the very contrary to
him you observe loud, sawcy, and over-bearing in a red Coat about
Town. But I was going to tell you, that in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec544.txt')">Honour</a> of the Profession of
Arms, I have set apart a certain Sum of Money for a Table for such
Gentlemen as have served their Country in the Army, and will please
from Time to Time to sojourn all, or any Part of the Year, at
_Coverley_. Such of them as will do me that Honour, shall find Horses,
Servants, and all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec544.txt')">things</a> necessary for their Accommodation and
Enjoyment of all the Conveniences of Life in a pleasant various
Country. If Colonel _Camperfelt_ be in Town, and his Abilities are not
employ'd another way in the Service, there is no Man would be more
welcome here. That Gentleman's thorough Knowledge in his Profession,
together with the Simplicity of his Manners, and Goodness of his
Heart, would induce others like him to honour my Abode; and I should
be glad my Acquaintance would take themselves to be invited or not, as
their Characters have an Affinity to his.</p><p>'I would have all my Friends know, that they need not fear (though I
am become a Country Gentleman) I will trespass against their
Temperance and Sobriety. No, Sir, I shall retain so much of the good
Sentiments for the Conduct of Life, which we cultivated in each other
at our Club, as to contemn all inordinate Pleasures: But particularly
remember, with our beloved _Tully_, that the Delight in Food consists
in Desire, not Satiety. They who most passionately pursue Pleasure,
seldomest arrive at it. Now I am writing to a Philosopher, I cannot
forbear mentioning the Satisfaction I took in the Passage I read
Yesterday in the same _Tully_. A Nobleman of _Athens_ made a
Compliment to _Plato_ the Morning after he had supped at his House,
_Your Entertainments do not only please when you give them, but also
the Day after_.</p><p>_I am, My worthy Friend,</p><p>Your most obedient humble Servant,_</p><p>WILLIAM SENTRY.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
