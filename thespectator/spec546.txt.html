<p>No. 546.              Wednesday, November 26, 1712.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Omnia patefacienda ut ne quid omnino quod venditor norit, emptor
ignoret.'</p><p>Tull.</p><p></p><p>It gives me very <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec546.txt')">great</a> Scandal to observe, where-ever I go, how much
Skill, in buying all <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec546.txt')">manner</a> of Goods, there is necessary to defend
yourself from being cheated in whatever you see exposed to Sale. My
Reading makes such a strong impression upon me, that I should think my
self a Cheat in my Way, if I should translate any thing from another
Tongue, and not acknowledge it to my Readers. I understood from common
Report, that Mr. _Cibber_ was introducing a _French_ <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec546.txt')">Play</a> upon our
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec546.txt')">Stage</a>, and thought my self concerned to let the Town know what was his,
and what foreign. [1] When I came to the Rehearsal, I found the House so
partial to one of their own Fraternity, that they gave every thing which
was said such Grace, Emphasis, and Force in their Action, that it was no
easy matter to make any Judgment of the Performance. Mrs. _Oldfield_,
who, it seems, is the Heroick Daughter, had so just a Conception of her
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec546.txt')">Part</a>, that her Action made what she spoke appear decent, just, and
noble. The Passions of Terrour and Compassion, they made me believe were
very artfully raised, and the whole Conduct of the Play artful and
surprizing. We Authors do not much relish the Endeavours of Players in
this kind; but have the same Disdain as Physicians and Lawyers have when
Attorneys and Apothecaries give Advice. _Cibber_ himself took the
liberty to tell me, that he expected I would do him Justice, and allow
the Play well-prepared for his Spectators, whatever it was for his
Readers. He added very many Particulars not uncurious concerning the
manner of taking an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec546.txt')">Audience</a>, and laying wait not only for their
superficial Applause, but also for insinuating into their Affections and
Passions, by the artful Management of the Look, Voice, and Gesture of
the Speaker. I could not but consent that the Heroick Daughter appeared
in the Rehearsal a moving Entertainment wrought out of a great and
exemplary Virtue.</p><p>The Advantages of Action, Show, and Dress on these Occasions are
allowable, because the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec546.txt')">Merit</a> consists in being capable of imposing upon
us to our Advantage and Entertainment. All that I was going to say about
the Honesty of an Author in the Sale of his Ware, was that he ought to
own all that he had borrowed from others, and lay in a clear light all
that he gives his Spectators for their <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec546.txt')">Money</a>, with an Account of the
first Manufacturers. But I intended to give the Lecture of this Day upon
the common and prostituted <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec546.txt')">Behaviour</a> of Traders in ordinary Commerce.
The Philosopher made it a Rule of <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec546.txt')">Trade</a>, that your Profit ought to be
the common Profit; and it is unjust to make any Step towards Gain,
wherein the Gain of even those to whom you sell is not also consulted. A
Man may deceive himself if he thinks fit, but he is no better than a
Cheat who sells any thing without telling the Exceptions against it, as
well as what is to be said to its Advantage. The scandalous abuse of
Language and hardening of Conscience, which may be observed every Day in
going from one Place to another, is what makes a whole City to an
unprejudiced Eye a Den of Thieves. It was no small pleasure to me for
this reason to remark, as I passed by _Cornhill_, that the Shop of that
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec546.txt')">worthy</a>, honest, tho' lately unfortunate, Citizen, Mr. _John Moreton_,
[2] so well known in the Linnen Trade, is fitting up a-new. Since a Man
has been in a distressed Condition, it ought to be a great Satisfaction
to have passed thro' it in such a Manner as not to have lost the
Friendship of those who suffered with him, but to receive an honourable
Acknowledgment of his Honesty from those very Persons to whom the Law
had consigned his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec546.txt')">Estate</a>.</p><p>The Misfortune of this Citizen is like to prove of a very general
Advantage to those who shall deal with him hereafter: For the Stock with
which he now sets up being the Loan of his Friends, he cannot expose
that to the Hazard of giving Credit, but enters into a Ready-Money
Trade, by which Means he will both buy and sell the best and cheapest.
He imposes upon himself a Rule of affixing the Value of each Piece he
sells to the Piece it self; so that the most ignorant Servant or Child
will be as good a Buyer at his Shop as the most skilful in the Trade.
For all which, you have all his Hopes and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec546.txt')">Fortune</a> for your Security. To
encourage Dealing after this Way, there is not only the avoiding the
most infamous Guilt in ordinary Bartering; but this Observation, That he
who buys with ready Money saves as much to his Family, as the State
exacts out of his Land for the Security and Service of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec546.txt')">Country</a>; that
is to say, in plain _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec546.txt')">English</a>_, Sixteen will do as much as Twenty
Shillings.</p><p>
_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'My Heart is so swelled with grateful Sentiments on account of some
Favours which I have lately received, that I must beg leave to give
them Utterance amongst the Croud of other anonymous Correspondents;
and writing, I hope, will be as great a Relief to my forced Silence,
as it is to your natural Taciturnity--My generous Benefactor will not
suffer me to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec546.txt')">speak</a> to him in any Terms of Acknowledgment, but ever
treats me as if he had the greatest Obligations, and uses me with a
Distinction that is not to be expected from one so much my Superiour
in Fortune, Years, and Understanding. He insinuates, as if I had a
certain Right to his Favours from some Merit, which his particular
Indulgence to me has discovered but that is only a beautiful Artifice
to lessen the Pain an honest Mind feels in receiving Obligations, when
there is no probability of returning them.</p><p>'A gift is doubled when accompanied with such a Delicacy of Address;
but what to me gives it an inexpressible Value, is its coming from the
Man I most esteem in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec546.txt')">World</a>. It pleases me indeed, as it is an
Advantage and Addition to my Fortune; but when I consider it is an
Instance of that good Man's Friendship, it overjoys, it transports me;
I look on it with a Lover's Eye, and no longer regard the Gift, but
the Hand that gave it. For my Friendship is so entirely void of any
gainful Views, that it often gives me Pain to think it should have
been chargeable to him; and I cannot at some melancholy Hours help
doing his Generosity the Injury of fearing it should cool on this
account, and that the last Favour might be a sort of Legacy of a
departing Friendship.</p><p>'I Confess these Fears seem very groundless and unjust, but you must
forgive them to the Apprehension of one possessed of a great Treasure,
who is frighted at the most distant Shadow of Danger.</p><p>'Since I have thus far open'd my Heart to you, I will not conceal the
<a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec546.txt')">secret</a> Satisfaction I feel there of knowing the Goodness of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec546.txt')">Friend</a>
will not be unrewarded. I am pleased with thinking the Providence of
the Almighty hath sufficient Blessings in store for him, and will
certainly discharge the Debt, though I am not made the happy
Instrument of doing it.</p><p>'However, nothing in my power shall be wanting to shew my Gratitude; I
will make it the Business of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec546.txt')">Life</a> to thank him, and shall esteem
(next to him) those my best Friends, who give me greatest Assistance
in this good Work. Printing this Letter would be some little Instance
of my Gratitude; and your Favour herein will very much oblige</p><p>_Your most humble Servant, &c._</p><p>W. C.</p><p>Nov. 24th.</p><p>
T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: _Ximena_, or the _Heroic Daughter_, a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec546.txt')">Tragedy</a> taken from
the _Cid_ of Corneille, by Colley Gibber. The play was not published
until after Steele's pamphlet, 'The Crisis,' had exposed him to
political and (as it necessarily followed in those days) personal
detraction. Cibber then dedicated his play to Steele, referring to the
custom of his calumniators, since they could not deny his literary
services, to transfer all the merit of them to Addison, upon whom he had
so generously heaped more than the half of his own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec546.txt')">fame</a>, and said:</p><p>"Your Enemies therefore, thus knowing that your own consent had partly
justified their insinuations, saved a great deal of their malice from
being ridiculous, and fairly left you to apply to such your singular
conduct what Mark Antony says of Octavius in the play:</p><p>'Fool that I was! upon my Eagle's wings
I bore this Wren, 'till I was tired with soaring,
And now, he mounts above me.'"</p><p>True-hearted Steele never read his relation to his friend in this
fashion. With how fine a disregard of conventional dignity is the latter
part of this paper given by Steele to the kind effort to help in setting
a fallen man upon his legs again!]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: See No. 248. To this Mr. Moreton was addressed the letter
signed W. S., from Sir William Scawen.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*    *    *    *    *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
