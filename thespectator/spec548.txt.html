<p>No. 548.               Friday, November 28, 1712.                    [1]</p><p></p><p>'--Vitiis nemo sine nascitur, optimus illo
Qui minimis urgetur--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>_Nov._ 27, 1712.</p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I have read this Day's Paper with a <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec548.txt')">great</a> deal of Pleasure, and could
send you an Account of several Elixirs and Antidotes in your third
Volume, which your Correspondents have not taken Notice of in their
Advertisements; and at the same time must own to you, that I have
seldom seen a Shop furnished with such a Variety of Medicaments, and
in which there are fewer Soporifics. The several Vehicles you have
invented for conveying your unacceptable Truths to us, are what I most
particularly admire, as I am afraid they are Secrets which will die
with you. I do not find that any of your Critical Essays are taken
Notice of in this Paper, notwithstanding I look upon them to be
excellent Cleansers of the Brain, and could venture to superscribe
them with an Advertisement which I have lately seen in one of our
News-Papers, wherein there is an Account given of a Sovereign Remedy
for restoring the Taste of all such Persons whose Palates have been
vitiated by Distempers, unwholesome Food, or any the like Occasions.
But to let fall the Allusion, notwithstanding your Criticisms, and
particularly the Candour which you have discovered in them, are not
the least taking <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec548.txt')">Part</a> of your Works, I find your Opinion concerning
_Poetical Justice_, as it is expressed in the first Part of your
Fortieth _Spectator_, is controverted by some eminent Criticks; and as
you now seem, to our great <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec548.txt')">Grief</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec548.txt')">Heart</a>, to be winding up your
Bottoms, I hoped you would have enlarged a little upon that Subject.
It is indeed but a single Paragraph in your Works, and I believe those
who have read it with the same Attention I have done, will think there
is nothing to be objected against it. I have however drawn up some
additional Arguments to strengthen the Opinion which you have there
delivered, having endeavoured to go to the Bottom of that Matter,
which you may either publish or suppress as you think fit.</p><p>'_Horace_ in my Motto says, that all Men are <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec548.txt')">vicious</a>, and that they
differ from one another, only as they are more or less so. _Boileau_
has given the same Account of our Wisdom, as _Horace_ has of our
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec548.txt')">Virtue</a>.</p><p>'Tous les homines sont fous, et, malgré tous leurs soins,
Ne different entre eux, que du plus et du moins.'</p><p>All Men, says he, are Fools, and, in spite of their Endeavours to the
contrary, differ from one another only as they are more or less so.</p><p>'Two or three of the old _Greek_ Poets have given the same turn to a
Sentence which describes the Happiness of Man in this Life;</p><p>[Greek: Tò zaen alypôs, andrós esti eutuchous]</p><p>'That Man is most happy who is the least miserable.</p><p>'It will not perhaps be unentertaining to the Polite <a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec548.txt')">Reader</a> to observe
how these three beautiful Sentences are formed upon different Subjects
by the same way of thinking; but I shall return to the first of them.</p><p>'Our Goodness being of a comparative, and not an absolute nature,
there is none who in strictness can be called a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec548.txt')">Virtuous</a> Man. Every
one has in him a natural Alloy, tho' one may be fuller of Dross than
another: For this reason I cannot think it right to introduce a
perfect or a faultless Man upon the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec548.txt')">Stage</a>; not only because such a
Character is improper to move Compassion, but because there is no such
a thing in Nature. This might probably be one Reason why the SPECTATOR
in one of his Papers took notice of that late invented Term called
_Poetical Justice_, and the wrong Notions into which it has led some
Tragick <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec548.txt')">Writers</a>. The most perfect Man has Vices enough to draw down
Punishments upon his Head, and to justify Providence in regard to any
Miseries that may befal him. For this reason I cannot think, but that
the Instruction and Moral are much finer, where a Man who is virtuous
in the main of his Character falls into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec548.txt')">Distress</a>, and sinks under the
Blows of Fortune at the End of a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec548.txt')">Tragedy</a>, than when he is represented
as Happy and Triumphant. Such an Example corrects the Insolence of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec548.txt')">Human</a> Nature, softens the Mind of the Beholder with Sentiments of Pity
and Compassion, comforts him under his own private <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec548.txt')">Affliction</a>, and
teaches him not to judge Mens <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec548.txt')">Virtues</a> by their Successes. I cannot
think of one real Hero in all Antiquity so far raised above Human
Infirmities, that he might not be very naturally represented in a
Tragedy as plunged in Misfortunes and Calamities. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec548.txt')">Poet</a> may still
find out some prevailing Passion or Indiscretion in his Character, and
shew it in such a Manner, as will sufficiently acquit the Gods of any
Injustice in his Sufferings. For as _Horace_ observes in my Text, the
best Man is faulty, tho' not in so great a degree as those whom we
generally call vicious Men.</p><p>'If such a strict Poetical Justice, as some Gentlemen insist upon, was
to be observed in this Art, there is no manner of Reason why it should
not extend to Heroick <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec548.txt')">Poetry</a>, as well as Tragedy. But we find it so
little observed in _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec548.txt')">Homer</a>_, that his _Achilles_ is placed in the
greatest point of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec548.txt')">Glory</a> and Success, though his Character is Morally
Vicious, and only Poetically Good, if I may use the Phrase of our
modern Criticks. The _Æneid_ is filled with Innocent, unhappy Persons.
_Nisus_ and _Eurialus, Lausus_ and _Pallas_ come all to unfortunate
Ends. The Poet takes Notice in particular, that in the Sacking of
_Troy, Ripheus_ fell, who was the most just Man among the _Trojans_.</p><p>'--Cadit et Ripheus justissimus unus,
Qui fuit in Teucris et servantissimus Æqui:
Dijs aliter visum est--'</p><p>'And that _Pantheus_ could neither be preserved by his transcendent
Piety, nor by the holy Fillets of _Apollo_, whose Priest he was.</p><p>'--nec Te tua plurima Pantheu
Labentem pietas, nec Apollinis infula texit.'</p><p>(Æn. 1. 2.)</p><p>'I might here mention the Practice of ancient Tragick Poets, both
_Greek_ and _Latin_; but as this Particular is touched upon in the
Paper above-mentioned, I shall pass it over in Silence. I could
produce Passages out of _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec548.txt')">Aristotle</a>_ in favour of my Opinion, and if in
one Place he says that an absolutely Virtuous Man should not be
represented as unhappy, this does not justifie any one who shall think
fit to bring in an absolutely virtuous Man upon the Stage. Those who
are acquainted with that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec548.txt')">Author</a>'s Way of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec548.txt')">Writing</a>, know very well, that
to take the whole extent of his Subject into his Divisions of it, he
often makes use of such Cases as are imaginary, and not reducible to
Practice: He himself declares that such Tragedies as ended unhappily
bore away the Prize in Theatrical Contentions, from those which ended
happily; and for the Fortieth Speculation, which I am now considering,
as it has given Reasons why these are more apt to please an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec548.txt')">Audience</a>,
so it only proves that these are generally preferable to the other,
tho' at the same time it affirms that many excellent Tragedies have
and may be written in both kinds.</p><p>['I shall conclude with observing, that though the _Spectator_
above-mentioned is so far against the Rule of Poetical Justice, as to
affirm, that good Men may meet with an unhappy Catastrophe in Tragedy,
it does not say that ill Men may go off unpunished. The Reason for
this Distinction is very plain, namely, because the best of Men are
vicious enough to justify Providence for any Misfortunes and
Afflictions which may befal them, but there are many Men so criminal
that they can have no Claim or Pretence to Happiness. The best of Men
may deserve Punishment, but the worst of Men cannot deserve
Happiness.']</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Unacknowledged, but doubtless by Addison, who took this
indirect way of answering Dennis. Addison's hand is further shown by the
