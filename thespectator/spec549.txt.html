<p>No. 549.              Saturday, November 29, 1712.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Quamvis digressu veteris confusus amici,
Laudo tamen--'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>I believe most <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec549.txt')">People</a> begin the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec549.txt')">World</a> with a Resolution to withdraw from
it into a serious kind of Solitude or Retirement, when they have made
themselves easie in it. Our Unhappiness is, that we find out some Excuse
or other for deferring such our good Resolutions till our intended
Retreat is cut off by Death. But among all kinds of People there are
none who are so hard to part with the World, as those who are grown old
in the heaping up of <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec549.txt')">Riches</a>. Their Minds are so warped with their
constant Attention to Gain, that it is very difficult for them to give
their Souls another Bent, and convert them towards those Objects, which,
though they are proper for every Stage of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec549.txt')">Life</a>, are so more especially
for the last. _Horace_ describes an old Usurer as so charmed with the
Pleasures of a <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec549.txt')">Country</a> Life, that in order to make a Purchase he called
in all his Mony; but what was the Event of it? Why in a very few Days
after he put it out again. I am engaged in this Series of Thought by a
Discourse which I had last Week with my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec549.txt')">worthy</a> Friend Sir ANDREW
FREEPORT, a Man of so much natural Eloquence, good Sense, and Probity of
Mind, that I always hear him with a particular Pleasure. As we were
sitting together, being the sole remaining Members of our Club, Sir
ANDREW gave me an Account of the many busie Scenes of Life in which he
had been engaged, and at the same time reckoned up to me abundance of
those lucky Hits, which at another time he would have called pieces of
good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec549.txt')">Fortune</a>; but in the Temper of Mind he was then, he termed them
Mercies, Favours of Providence, and Blessings upon an honest Industry.
Now, says he, you must know my good Friend, I am so used to consider my
self as Creditor and Debtor, that I often state my Accounts after the
same manner with regard to Heaven and my own Soul. In this case, when I
look upon the Debtor-side, I find such innumerable Articles, that I want
Arithmetick to cast them up; but when I look upon the Creditor-side, I
find little more than blank Paper. Now though I am very well satisfied
that it is not in my power to ballance Accounts with my Maker, I am
resolved however to turn all my future Endeavours that way. You must not
therefore be surprized, my Friend, if you hear that I am betaking my
self to a more thoughtful kind of Life, and if I meet you no more in
this Place.</p><p>I could not but approve so good a Resolution, notwithstanding the Loss I
shall suffer by it. Sir ANDREW has since explained himself to me more at
large in the following Letter, which is just come to my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec549.txt')">hands</a>.</p><p>
_Good Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Notwithstanding my Friends at the Club have always rallied me, when I
have talked of retiring from Business, and repeated to me one of my
own Sayings, _That a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec549.txt')">Merchant</a> has never enough till he has got a
little more_; I can now inform you, that there is one in the World who
thinks he has enough, and is determined to pass the Remainder of his
Life in the Enjoyment of what he has. You know me so well, that I need
not tell you, I mean, by the Enjoyment of my Possessions, the making
of them useful to the Publick. As the greatest part of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec549.txt')">Estate</a> has
been hitherto of an unsteady and volatile nature, either tost upon
Seas or fluctuating in Funds; it is now fixed and settled in
Substantial Acres and Tenements. I have removed it from the
Uncertainty of Stocks, Winds and Waves, and disposed of it in a
considerable Purchase. This will give me <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec549.txt')">great</a> Opportunity of being
charitable in my way, that is, in setting my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec549.txt')">poor</a> Neighbours to Work,
and giving them a comfortable Subsistence out of their own Industry.
My Gardens, my Fish-ponds, my Arable and Pasture Grounds shall be my
several Hospitals, or rather Work-houses, in which I propose to
maintain a great many indigent Persons, who are now starving in my
Neighbourhood. I have got a fine Spread of improveable Lands, and in
my own Thoughts am already plowing up some of them, fencing others;
planting <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec549.txt')">Woods</a>, and draining Marshes. In fine, as I have my share in
the Surface of this Island, I am resolved to make it as <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec549.txt')">beautiful</a> a
Spot as any in her Majesty's Dominions; at least there is not an Inch
of it which shall not be cultivated to the best Advantage, and do its
utmost for its Owner. As in my Mercantile Employment I so disposed of
my Affairs, that from whatever Corner of the Compass the Wind blew, it
was bringing home one or other of my Ships; I hope, as a Husbandman,
to contrive it so, that not a Shower of Rain, or a Glimpse of
Sunshine, shall fall upon my Estate without bettering some part of it,
and contributing to the Products of the Season. You know it has been
hitherto my Opinion of Life, that it is thrown away when it is not
some way useful to others. But when I am riding out by my self, in the
fresh Air on the open Heath that lies by my House, I find several
other Thoughts growing up in me. I am now of opinion that a Man [of my
Age] may find Business enough on himself, by setting his Mind in
order, preparing it for another World, and reconciling it to the
Thoughts of Death. I must therefore acquaint you, that besides those
usual Methods of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec549.txt')">Charity</a>, of which I have before spoken, I am at this
very Instant finding out a convenient Place where I may build an
Alms-house, which I intend to endow very handsomely, for a Dozen
superannuated Husbandmen. It will be a great pleasure to me to say my
Prayers twice a-day with Men of my own [Years [1]], who all of them,
as well as my self, may have their Thoughts taken up how they shall
die, rather than how they shall live. I remember an excellent Saying
that I learned at School, _Finis coronat opus_. You know best whether
it be in _Virgil_ or in _Horace_, it is my business to apply it. If
your Affairs will permit you to take the Country Air with me
sometimes, you shall find an Apartment fitted up for you, and shall be
every day entertained with Beef or Mutton of my own feeding; Fish out
of my own Ponds; and Fruit out of my own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec549.txt')">Garden</a>[s]. You shall have
free Egress and Regress about my House, without having any Questions
asked you, and in a Word such an hearty Welcome as you may expect from</p><p>_Your most sincere Friend
and humble Servant,_</p><p>ANDREW FREEPORT.</p><p>
The Club, of which I am Member, being entirely dispersed, I shall
consult my Reader next Week, upon a Project relating to the Institution
of a new one.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Age.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
