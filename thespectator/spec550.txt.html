<p>No. 550.                Monday, December 1, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Quid dignum tanto feret hic promissor HIATU?'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Since the late Dissolution of the <a name="topic46" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec550.txt')">Club</a> whereof I have often declared my
self a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec550.txt')">Member</a>, there are very many Persons who by Letters, Petitions,
and Recommendations, put up for the next Election. At the same time I
must complain, that several indirect and underhand Practices have been
made use of upon this Occasion. A certain Country Gentleman begun to
_tapp_ upon the first Information he received of Sir ROGER'S Death; when
he sent me up <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec550.txt')">word</a>, that if I would get him chosen in the Place of the
Deceased, he would present me with a Barrel of the best _October_ I had
ever drank in my Life. The Ladies are in <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec550.txt')">great</a> Pain to know whom I
intend to elect in the Room of WILL. HONEYCOMBE. Some of them indeed are
of Opinion that Mr. HONEYCOMBE did not take sufficient care of their
Interests in the Club, and are therefore desirous of having in it
hereafter a Representative of their own Sex. A Citizen who subscribes
himself _Y. Z._ tells me that he has one and twenty Shares in the
_African_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec550.txt')">Company</a>, and offers to bribe me with the odd one in case he
may succeed Sir ANDREW FREEPORT, which he thinks would raise the Credit
of that Fund. I have several Letters, dated from _Fenny Man's_, by
Gentlemen who are Candidates for Capt. SENTRY'S Place, and as many from
a Coffee-House in _Paul's_ Church-yard of such who would fill up the
Vacancy occasioned by the Death of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec550.txt')">worthy</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec550.txt')">Friend</a> the Clergyman, whom
I can never mention but with a particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec550.txt')">Respect</a>.</p><p>Having maturely weighed these several Particulars, with the many
Remonstrances that have been made to me on this Subject, and considering
how invidious an Office I shall take upon me, if I make the whole
Election depend upon my single Voice, and being unwilling to expose my
self to those Clamours, which, on such an Occasion, will not fail to be
raised against me for Partiality, Injustice, Corruption, and other
Qualities which my Nature abhors, I have formed to my self the Project
of a Club as follows.</p><p>I have thoughts of issuing out Writs to all and every of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec550.txt')">Clubs</a> that
are established in the Cities of _London_ and _Westminster_, requiring
them to chuse out of their respective Bodies a Person of the greatest
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec550.txt')">Merit</a>, and to return his name to me before _Lady-day_, at which time I
intend to sit upon Business.</p><p>By this means I may have Reason to hope, that the Club over which I
shall preside will be the very Flower and Quintescence of all other
Clubs. I have communicated this my Project to none but a particular
Friend of mine, whom I have celebrated twice or thrice for his Happiness
in that kind of Wit which is commonly known by the Name of a Punn. The
only Objection he makes to it is, that I shall raise up Enemies to my
self if I act with so regal an Air; and that my Detractors, instead of
giving me the usual Title of SPECTATOR, will be apt to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec550.txt')">call</a> me the _King
of Clubs_.</p><p>But to proceed on my intended Project: It is very well known that I at
first set forth in this Work with the Character of a silent Man; and I
think I have so well preserved my Taciturnity, that I do not remember to
have violated it with three Sentences in the space of almost two Years.
As a Monosyllable is my Delight, I have made very few Excursions in the
Conversations which I have related beyond a Yes or a No. By this Means
my Readers have lost many good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec550.txt')">things</a> which I have had in my Heart,
though I did not care for uttering them.</p><p>Now in order to diversify my Character, and to shew the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec550.txt')">World</a> how well I
can talk if I have a Mind, I have Thoughts of being very loquacious in
the Club which I have now under Consideration. But that I may proceed
the more regularly in this Affair, I design, upon the first Meeting of
the said Club, to have _my Mouth opened_ in form; intending to regulate
my self in this Particular by a certain Ritual which I have by me, that
contains all the Ceremonies which are practised at the opening of the
Mouth of a Cardinal. I have likewise examined the forms which were used
of old by _Pythagoras_, when any of his Scholars, after an
Apprenticeship of Silence, was made free of his Speech. In the mean
time, as I have of late found my Name in foreign Gazettes upon less
Occasions, I question not but in their next Articles from _Great
Britain_, they will inform the World that _the_ SPECTATOR'S _Mouth is to
be opened on the twenty-fifth of_ March _next_. [1] I may perhaps
publish a very useful Paper at that Time of the Proceedings in that
Solemnity, and of the Persons who shall assist at it. But of this more
hereafter.</p><p>O.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: On the twelfth of the following March appeared the first
number of Steele's _Guardian_. Addison's attempt to revive the
_Spectator_ was not made until June, 1714.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
