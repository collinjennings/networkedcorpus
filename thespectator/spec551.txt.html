<p>No. 551.                Tuesday, December 2, 1712.</p><p></p><p>'Sic Honor et Nomen divinis vatibus atque
Carminibus venit.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>When Men of <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec551.txt')">worthy</a> and excelling <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec551.txt')">Genius</a>'s have obliged the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec551.txt')">World</a> with
<a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec551.txt')">beautiful</a> and instructive Writings, it is in the nature of Gratitude
that Praise should be returned them, as one proper consequent Reward
of their Performances. Nor has Mankind ever been so degenerately sunk,
but they have made this Return, and even when they have not been
wrought up by the generous Endeavour so as to receive the Advantages
designed by it. This Praise, which arises first in the Mouth of
particular Persons, spreads and lasts according to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec551.txt')">Merit</a> of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec551.txt')">Authors</a>; and when it thus meets with a full Success changes its
Denomination, and is called _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec551.txt')">Fame</a>_. They who have happily arrived at
this, are, even while they live, enflamed by the Acknowledgments of
others, and spurred on to new Undertakings for the Benefit of Mankind,
notwithstanding the Detraction which some abject Tempers would cast
upon them: But when they decease, their Characters being freed from
the Shadow which _Envy_ laid them under, begin to shine out with
greater Splendour; their Spirits survive in their Works; they are
admitted into the highest Companies, and they continue pleasing and
instructing Posterity from Age to Age. Some of the best gain a
Character, by being able to shew that they are no Strangers to them;
and others obtain a new Warmth to labour for the Happiness and Ease of
Mankind, from a Reflection upon those Honours which are paid to their
Memories.</p><p>The Thought of this took me up as I turned over those Epigrams which
are the Remains of several of the _Wits_ of _Greece_, and perceived
many dedicated to the Fame of those who had excelled in beautiful
poetick Performances. Wherefore, in pursuance to my Thought, I
concluded to do something along with them to bring their Praises into
a new Light and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec551.txt')">Language</a>, for the Encouragement of those whose modest
Tempers may be deterr'd by the Fear of Envy or Detraction from fair
Attempts, to which their Parts might render them equal. You will
perceive them as they follow to be conceived in the form of Epitaphs,
a sort of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec551.txt')">Writing</a> which is wholly set apart for a short pointed Method
of Praise.</p><p>On _Orpheus_, written by _Antipater_.</p><p>'No longer_, Orpheus, _shall thy sacred Strains
Lead Stones, and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec551.txt')">Trees</a>, and Beasts along the Plains;
No longer sooth the boistrous Wind to sleep,
Or still the Billows of the raging Deep:
For thou art gone, the Muses mourn'd thy Fall
In solemn Strains, thy Mother most of all.
Ye Mortals, idly for your Sons ye moan,
If thus a Goddess could not save her own.'</p><p>Observe here, that if we take the <a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec551.txt')">Fable</a> for granted, as it was
believed to be in that Age when the Epigram was written, the Turn
appears to have Piety to the Gods, and a resigning Spirit in its
Application. But if we consider the Point with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec551.txt')">respect</a> to our present
Knowledge, it will be less esteem'd; though the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec551.txt')">Author</a> himself,
because he believ'd it, may still be more valued than any one who
should now write with a Point of the same Nature.</p><p>On _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec551.txt')">Homer</a>_, by _Alpheus_ of _Mytilene_.</p><p>'Still in our Ears_ Andromache _complains,
And still in sight the Fate of_ Troy _remains;
Still_ Ajax _fights, still_ Hector's _dragg'd along,
Such strange Enchantment dwells in_ Homer's _Song;
Whose Birth cou'd more than one poor Realm adorn,
For all the World is proud that he was born.'</p><p>The Thought in the first part of this is natural, and depending upon
the Force of Poesy: In the latter part it looks as if it would aim at
the History of seven Towns contending for the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec551.txt')">Honour</a> of _Homer's_
Birth-place; but when you expect to meet with that common Story, the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec551.txt')">Poet</a> slides by, and raises the whole _World_ for a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec551.txt')">kind</a> of _Arbiter_,
which is to end the Contention amongst its several Parts.</p><p>On _Anacreon_ by _Antipater._</p><p>'This Tomb be thine,_ Anacreon; _all around
Let Ivy wreath, let Flourets deck the Ground,
And from its Earth, enrich'd with such a Prize,
Let Wells of Milk and Streams of Wine arise:
So will thine Ashes yet a Pleasure know,
If any Pleasure reach the Shades below.'</p><p>The Poet here written upon, is an easy gay Author, and he who writes
upon him has filled his own Head with the Character of his Subject. He
seems to love his Theme so much, that he thinks of nothing but
pleasing him as if he were still alive, by entering into his Libertine
Spirit; so that the Humour is easy and gay, resembling _Anacreon_ in
its Air, raised by such Images, and pointed with such a Turn as he
might have used. I give it a place here, because the Author may have
design'd it for his Honour; and I take an Opportunity from it to
advise others, that when they would praise, they cautiously avoid
every looser Qualification, and fix only where there is a real
Foundation in Merit.</p><p>On _Euripides_, by _Ion._</p><p>'Divine_ Euripides, _this Tomb we see
So fair, is not a Monument for thee,
So much as thou for it, since all will own
Thy Name and lasting Praise adorns the Stone.'</p><p>The Thought here is fine, but its Fault is, that it is general, that
it may belong to any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec551.txt')">great</a> Man, because it points out no particular
Character. It would be better, if when we light upon such a Turn, we
join it with something that circumscribes and bounds it to the
Qualities of our Subject. He who gives his Praise in gross, will often
appear either to have been a Stranger to those he writes upon, or not
to have found any thing in them which is Praise-worthy.</p><p>On _Sophocles_, by _Simonides_.</p><p>'Winde, gentle Ever-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec551.txt')">green</a>, to form a Shade
Around the Tomb where_ Sophocles _is laid;
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec551.txt')">Sweet</a> Ivy winde thy Boughs, and intertwine
With blushing Roses and the clustring Vine:
Thus will thy lasting Leaves, with Beauties hung,
Prove grateful Emblems of the Lays he sung;
Whose Soul, exalted like a_ God _of_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec551.txt')">Wit</a>,
_Among the_ Muses _and the_ Graces _writ.'</p><p>This Epigram I have open'd more than any of the former: The Thought
towards the latter End seemed closer couched, so as to require an
Explication. I fancied the Poet aimed at the Picture which is
generally made of _Apollo_ and the _Muses_, he sitting with his Harp
in the Middle, and they around him. This look'd beautiful to my
Thought, and because the Image arose before me out of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec551.txt')">Words</a> of the
Original as I was reading it, I venture to explain them so.</p><p>On _Menander_, the Author unnamed.</p><p>'The very Bees, O sweet_ Menander, _hung
To taste the_ Muses _Spring upon thy Tongue;
The very_ Graces _made the Scenes you writ
Their happy Point of fine Expression hit.
Thus still you live, you make your_ Athens _shine,
And raise its <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec551.txt')">Glory</a> to the Skies in thine.'</p><p>This Epigram has a respect to the Character of its Subject; for
_Menander_ writ remarkably with a Justness and Purity of Language. It
has also told the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec551.txt')">Country</a> he was born in, without either a set or a
hidden <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec551.txt')">Manner</a>, while it twists together the Glory of the Poet and his
Nation, so as to make the Nation depend upon his for an Encrease of
its own.</p><p>I will offer no more Instances at present, to shew that they who
deserve Praise have it returned them from different Ages. Let these
which have been laid down, shew Men that Envy will not always prevail.
And to the End that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec551.txt')">Writers</a> may more successfully enliven the
Endeavours of one another, let them consider, in some such Manner as I
have attempted, what may be the justest Spirit and Art of Praise. It
is indeed very hard to come up to it. Our Praise is trifling when it
depends upon Fable; it is false when it depends upon wrong
Qualifications; it means nothing when it is general; it is extreamly
difficult to hit when we propose to raise Characters high, while we
keep to them justly. I shall end this with transcribing that excellent
Epitaph of Mr. _Cowley_, wherein, with a kind of grave and
philosophick Humour, he very beautifully speaks of himself (withdrawn
from the World, and dead to all the Interests of it) as of a Man
really deceased. At the same time it is an Instruction how to leave
the Publick with a good Grace.</p><p>Epitaphium Vivi Authoris.</p><p>'<a name="topic15" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec551.txt')">Hic</a>, O Viator, sub Lare parvulo_
Couleius _hic <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec551.txt')">est</a> conditus, hic jacet
Defunctus Humani Laboris
Sorte, supervacuaque Vita,
Non Indecora pauperie nitens,
Et non inerti Nobilis Otio,
Vanoque dilectis popello
Divitiis animosus hostis.
Possis ut illum dicere mortuum
En Terra jam nunc Quantula sufficit?
Exempta sit Curis, Viator,
Terra sit illa lævis, precare.
Hic sparge Flores, sparge breves Rosas,
Nam Vita gaudet Mortua Floribus,
Herbisque Odoratis Corona
Vatis adhuc Cinerem Calentem.'</p><p>
[The Publication of these Criticisms having procured me the following
Letter from a very ingenious Gentleman, I cannot forbear inserting it in
the Volume, though it did not come soon enough to have a place in any of
my single Papers.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Having read over in your Paper, No. 551. some of the Epigrams made by
the _Grecian_ Wits, in commendation of their celebrated Poets, I could
not forbear sending you another, out of the same Collection; which I
take to be as great a Compliment to _Homer_, as any that has yet been
paid him.</p><p>[Greek: Tís poth' ho tòn Troiaes pólemon, &c.]</p><p>Who first transcribed the famous_ Trojan _War,
And wise_ Ulysses' _Acts, O_ Jove, _make known:
For since 'tis certain, Thine those Poems are,
No more let_ Homer _boast they are his own.</p><p>
If you think it worthy of a Place in your Speculations, for ought I
know (by that means) it may in time be printed as often in _English_,
as it has already been in _Greek_, I am (like the rest of the World)</p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>_Your great Admirer_,
G. R.
4th _Dec_.</p><p>
The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec551.txt')">Reader</a> may observe that the Beauty of this Epigram is different from
that of any in the foregoing. An Irony is look'd upon as the finest
Palliative of Praise; and very often conveys the noblest Panegyrick
under the Appearance of Satire. _Homer_ is here seemingly accused and
treated as a Plagiary; but what is drawn up in the form of an Accusation
is certainly, as my Correspondent observes, the greatest Compliment that
could have been paid to that Divine Poet.]</p><p>
_Dear Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I am a Gentleman of a pretty good Fortune, and of a Temper impatient
of any thing which I think an Injury; however I always quarrelled
according to Law, and instead of attacking my Adversary by the
dangerous Method of Sword and Pistol, I made my Assaults by that more
secure one of Writ or Warrant. I cannot help telling you, that either
by the Justice of my Causes, or the Superiority of my Counsel, I have
been generally successful; and to my great Satisfaction I can say it,
that by three Actions of Slander, and half a dozen Trespasses, I have
for several Years enjoy'd a perfect Tranquility in my Reputation and
Estate. By these means also I have been made known to the Judges, the
Serjeants of our Circuit are my intimate Friends, and the Ornamental
Counsel pay a very profound Respect to one who has made so great a
Figure in the Law. Affairs of Consequence having brought me to Town, I
had the Curiosity t'other day to visit _Westminster-Hall_; and having
placed my self in one of the Courts, expected to be most agreeably
entertained. After the Court and Counsel were, with due Ceremony,
seated, up stands a learned Gentleman, and began, When this _Matter_
was last _stirr'd_ before your Lordship: The next humbly moved to
_quash_ an _Indictment_; another complain'd that his Adversary had
_snapp'd_ a _Judgment_; the next informed the Court that his Client
was _stripp'd_ of his _Possession_; another begg'd Leave to acquaint
his Lordship, that they had been _saddled_ with Costs. At last up got
a grave Serjeant, and told us his Client had been _hung up_ a whole
Term by a _Writ of Error_. At this I could bear it no longer, but came
hither, and resolv'd to apply my self to your Honour to interpose with
these Gentlemen, that they would leave off such low and unnatural
Expressions: For surely tho' the Lawyers subscribe to hideous _French_
and false _Latin_, yet they should let their Clients have a little
decent and proper _English_ for their Money. What Man that has a Value
for a good Name would like to have it said in a publick Court, that
Mr. such-a-one was _stripp'd, saddled_ or _hung up_? This being what
has escaped your Spectatorial Observation, be pleas'd to correct such
an illiberal Cant among profess'd Speakers, and you'll infinitely
oblige
_Your humble Servant_,
Philonicus.</p><p>Joe's _Coffee-house_,
