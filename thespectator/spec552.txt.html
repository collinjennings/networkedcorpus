<p>No. 552.               Wednesday, December 3, 1712.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>'--Quæ prægravat artes
Infra se positas extinctus amabitur idem.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>As I was tumbling about the Town the other Day in an Hackney-Coach, and
delighting my self with busy Scenes in the Shops of each Side of me, it
came into my Head, with no small Remorse, that I had not been frequent
enough in the Mention and Recommendation of the industrious Part of
Mankind. It very naturally, upon this Occasion, touched my Conscience in
particular, that I had not acquitted my self to my <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec552.txt')">Friend</a> Mr. _Peter
Motteux_. [1] That industrious Man of <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec552.txt')">Trade</a>, and formerly Brother of the
Quill, has dedicated to me a Poem upon Tea. It would injure him, as a
Man of Business, if I did not let the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec552.txt')">World</a> know that the Author of so
good Verses writ them before he was concern'd in Traffick. In order to
expiate my Negligence towards him, I immediately resolv'd to make him a
Visit. I found his spacious Warehouses fill'd and adorn'd with Tea,
_China_ and _Indian_ Ware. I could observe a <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec552.txt')">beautiful</a> Ordonnance of the
whole; and such different and considerable Branches of Trade carried on,
in the same House, I exulted in seeing dispos'd by a Poetical Head. In
one place were exposed to view Silks of various Shades and Colours, rich
Brocades, and the wealthiest Products of foreign Looms.</p><p>Here you might see the finest Laces held up by the fairest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec552.txt')">Hands</a>, and
there examin'd by the beauteous Eyes of the Buyers, the most delicate
Cambricks, Muslins, and Linnens. I could not but congratulate my Friend
on the humble, but, I hoped, beneficial Use he had made of his Talents,
and wished I could be a Patron to his Trade, as he had been pleased to
make me of his Poetry. The honest Man has, I know, that modest Desire of
Gain which is peculiar to those who understand better <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec552.txt')">Things</a> than
Riches: and I dare say he would be contented with much less than what is
called Wealth at that Quarter of the Town which he inhabits, and will
oblige all his Customers with Demands <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec552.txt')">agreeable</a> to the Moderation of his
Desires.</p><p>Among other Omissions of which I have been also guilty, with relation to
Men of Industry of a superior Order, I must acknowledge my Silence
towards a Proposal frequently enclosed to me by Mr. _Renatus Harris,
Organ-Builder_. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec552.txt')">ambition</a> of this Artificer is to erect an Organ in
St. _Paul's_ Cathedral, over the West Door, at the Entrance into the
Body of the Church, which in Art and Magnificence shall transcend any
Work of that kind ever before invented. The Proposal in perspicuous
Language sets forth the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec552.txt')">Honour</a> and Advantage such a Performance would be
to the _British_ Name, as well as that it would apply the Power of
Sounds in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec552.txt')">manner</a> more amazingly forcible than, perhaps, has yet been
known, and I am sure to an End much more <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec552.txt')">worthy</a>. Had the vast Sums which
have been laid out upon Opera's without Skill or Conduct, and to no
other Purpose but to suspend or vitiate our Understandings, been
disposed this Way, we should now perhaps have an Engine so formed as to
strike the Minds of half a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec552.txt')">People</a> at once in a Place of Worship with a
Forgetfulness of present Care and Calamity, and a Hope of endless
Rapture, Joy, and Hallelujah hereafter.</p><p>When I am doing this Justice, I am not to forget the best Mechanick of
my Acquaintance, that useful Servant to Science and Knowledge, Mr. _John
Rowley_; but I think I lay a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec552.txt')">great</a> Obligation on the Publick, by
acquainting them with his Proposals for a Pair of new Globes. After his
Preamble, he promises in the said Proposals that,</p><p>
_In the Celestial Globe,_</p><p>'Care shall be taken that the fixed Stars be placed according to their
true Longitude and Latitude, from the many and correct Observations of
_Hevelius, Cassini_, Mr. _Flamsteed_, Reg. Astronomer, Dr. _Halley
Savilian_ Professor of Geometry in _Oxon_; and from whatever else can
be procured to render the Globe more exact, instructive, and useful.</p><p>'That all the Constellations be drawn in a curious, new, and
particular manner; each Star in so just, distinct, and conspicuous a
Proportion, that its true Magnitude may be readily known by bare
Inspection, according to the different _Light_ and _Sizes_ of the
Stars. That the Track or Way of such Comets as have been well
observ'd, but not hitherto expressed in any Globe, be carefully
delineated in this.</p><p>
_In the Terrestrial Globe._</p><p>'That by reason the Descriptions formerly made, both in the _English_
[and [2]] _Dutch_ great Globes, are erroneous, _Asia, Africa_, and
_America_, be drawn in a Manner wholly new; by which means it is to be
noted, that the Undertakers will be obliged to alter the Latitude of
some Places in 10 Degrees, the Longitude of others in 20 Degrees:
besides which great and necessary Alterations, there be many
remarkable Countries, Cities, Towns, Rivers, and Lakes, omitted in
other Globes, inserted here according to the best Discoveries made by
our late Navigators. Lastly, That the Course of the Trade-Winds, the
_Monsoons_, and other Winds periodically shifting between the
Tropicks, be visibly express'd.</p><p>
'Now in Regard that this Undertaking is of so universal Use, as the
Advancement of the most necessary Parts of the Mathematicks, as well
as tending to the Honour of the _British_ Nation, and that the Charge
of carrying it on is very expensive; it is desired that all Gentlemen
who are willing to promote so great a Work, will be pleased to
subscribe on the following Conditions.</p><p>'I. The Undertakers engage to furnish each Subscriber with a Celestial
and Terrestrial Globe, each of 30 Inches Diameter, in all Respects
curiously adorned, the Stars gilded, the Capital Cities plainly
distinguished, the Frames, Meridians, Horizons, Hour Circles and
Indexes so exactly finished up, and accurately divided, that a Pair of
these Globes will really appear in the Judgment of any disinterested
and intelligent Person, worth Fifteen Pounds more than will be
demanded for them by the Undertakers.</p><p>'II. Whosoever will be pleas'd to subscribe, and pay Twenty Five
Pounds in the Manner following for a Pair of these Globes, either for
their own Use, or to present them to any College in the Universities,
or any publick Library or School, shall have his Coat of Arms, Name,
Title, Seat, or Place of Residence, _&c._, inserted in some convenient
Place of the Globe.</p><p>'III. That every Subscriber do at first pay down the Sum of Ten
Pounds, and Fifteen Pounds more upon the delivery of each Pair of
Globes perfectly fitted up. And that the said Globes be deliver'd
within Twelve Months after the Number of Thirty Subscribers be
compleated; and that the Subscribers be served with Globes in the
Order in which they subscribed.</p><p>'IV. That a Pair of these Globes shall not hereafter to be sold to any
Person but the Subscribers under Thirty Pounds.</p><p>'V. That if there be not thirty Subscribers within four Months after
the first of _December_, 1712, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec552.txt')">Money</a> paid shall be return'd on
Demand by Mr. _John Warner_ Gold-smith near _Temple-Bar_, who shall
receive and pay the same according to the above-mention'd Articles.</p><p>
