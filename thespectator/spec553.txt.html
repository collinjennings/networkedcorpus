<p>No. 553.              Thursday, December 4, 1712.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Nec lusisse pudet, sed non incidere ludum.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>The Project which I published on _Monday_ last has brought me in several
Packets of Letters. Among the rest I have receiv'd one from a certain
Projector, wherein after having represented, that in all probability the
Solemnity of _opening my Mouth_ will draw together a <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec553.txt')">great</a> Confluence of
Beholders, he proposes to me the hiring of _Stationer's-Hall_ for the
more convenient exhibiting of that Publick Ceremony. He undertakes to be
at the Charge of it himself, provided he may have the erecting of
Galleries on every side, and the letting of them out upon that Occasion.
I have a Letter also from a Bookseller, petitioning me in a very humble
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec553.txt')">manner</a>, that he may have the Printing of the Speech which I shall make
to the Assembly upon the first opening of my Mouth. I am informed from
all Parts, that there are great Canvassings in the several <a name="topic46" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec553.txt')">Clubs</a> about
Town, upon the chusing of a proper Person to sit with me on those
arduous Affairs, to which I have summoned them. Three Clubs have already
proceeded to Election, whereof one has made a double Return. If I find
that my Enemies shall take Advantage of my Silence to begin Hostilities
upon me, or if any other Exigency of Affairs may so require, since I see
Elections in so great a forwardness, we may possibly meet before the Day
appointed; or if matters go on to my Satisfaction, I may perhaps put off
the Meeting to a further Day; but of this Publick Notice shall be given.</p><p>In the mean time, I must confess that I am not a little gratify'd and
oblig'd by that Concern which appears in this great City upon my present
Design of laying down this Paper. It is likewise with much Satisfaction,
that I find some of the most outlying Parts of the Kingdom alarm'd upon
this Occasion, having receiv'd Letters to expostulate with me about it,
from several of my Readers of the remotest Boroughs of _Great Britain_.
Among these I am very well pleased with a Letter dated from _Berwick
upon Tweed_, wherein my Correspondent compares the Office which I have
for some time executed in these Realms to the Weeding of a great Garden;
which, says he, it is not sufficient to weed once for all, and
afterwards to give over, but that the Work must be continued daily, or
the same Spots of Ground which are cleared for a while, will in a little
time be over-run as much as ever. Another Gentleman lays before me
several Enormities that are already sprouting, and which he believes
will discover themselves in their Growth immediately after my
Disappearance. There is no doubt, says he, but the Ladies Heads will
shoot up as soon as they know they are no longer under the _Spectator's_
Eye; and I have already seen such monstrous broad-brimmed Hats under the
Arms of Foreigners, that I question not but they will overshadow the
Island within a Month or two after the dropping of your Paper. But among
all the Letters which are come to my hands, there is none so handsomely
written as the following one, which I am the more pleased with, as it is
sent me from Gentlemen who belong to a Body which I shall always <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec553.txt')">Honour</a>,
and where (I cannot <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec553.txt')">speak</a> it without a secret Pride) my Speculations
have met with a very kind Reception. It is usual for Poets, upon the
publishing of their Works, to print before them such Copies of Verses as
have been made in their Praise. Not that you must imagine they are
pleased with their own Commendations, but because the elegant
Compositions of their Friends should not be lost. I must make the same
Apology for the Publication of the ensuing Letter, in which I have
suppressed no Part of those Praises that are given my Speculations with
too lavish and good-natured an Hand; though my Correspondents can
witness for me, that at other times I have generally blotted out those
Parts in the Letters which I have received from them.</p><p>[O.]</p><p>
_Oxford, Nov. 25._</p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'In spight of your Invincible Silence you have found out a Method of
being the most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec553.txt')">agreeable</a> Companion in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec553.txt')">World</a>: That kind of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec553.txt')">Conversation</a> which you hold with the Town, has the good Fortune of
being always pleasing to the Men of Taste and Leisure, and never
offensive to those of Hurry and Business. You are never heard, but at
what _Horace_ calls _dextro tempore_, and have the Happiness to
observe the politick Rule, which the same discerning Author gave his
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec553.txt')">Friend</a>, when he enjoin'd him to deliver his Book to _Augustus_.</p><p>'Si validus, si lætus erit, si denique poscet.'</p><p>'You never begin to talk, but when <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec553.txt')">People</a> are desirous to hear you;
and I defy any one to be out of humour till you leave off. But I am
led unawares into Reflections, foreign to the original Design of this
Epistle; which was to let you know, that some unfeigned Admirers of
your inimitable Papers, who could, without any Flattery, greet you
with the Salutation used to the Eastern Monarchs, viz. _O Spec, live
for ever_, have lately been under the same Apprehensions, with Mr.
_Philo-Spec_; that the haste you have made to dispatch your best
Friends portends no long Duration to your own short Visage. We could
not, indeed, find any just Grounds for Complaint in the Method you
took to dissolve that venerable Body: No, the World was not <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec553.txt')">worthy</a> of
your Divine. WILL. HONEYCOMB could not, with any Reputation, live
single any longer. It was high time for the TEMPLAR to turn himself to
_Coke_: And Sir ROGER's dying was the wisest thing he ever did in his
Life. It was, however, matter of great Grief to us, to think that we
were in danger of losing so Elegant and Valuable an Entertainment. And
we could not, without Sorrow, reflect that we were likely to have
nothing to interrupt our Sips in a Morning, and to suspend our Coffee
in mid-air, between our Lips and Right Ear, but the ordinary Trash of
News-Papers. We resolved, therefore, not to part with you so. But
since, to make use of your own Allusion, the Cherries began now to
crowd the Market, and their Season was almost over, we consulted our
future Enjoyments, and endeavoured to make the exquisite Pleasure that
delicious Fruit gave our Taste as lasting as we could, and by drying
them protract their stay beyond its natural Date. We own that thus
they have not a Flavour equal to that of their juicy Bloom; but yet,
under this Disadvantage, they pique the Palate, and become a Salver
better than any other Fruit at its first Appearance. To speak plain,
there are a Number of us who have begun your Works afresh, and meet
two Nights in the Week in order to give you a Rehearing. We never come
together without drinking your Health, and as seldom part without
general Expressions of Thanks to you for our Night's Improvement. This
we conceive to be a more useful Institution than any other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec553.txt')">Club</a>
whatever, not excepting even that of _ugly Faces_. We have one
manifest Advantage over that renowned <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec553.txt')">Society</a>, with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec553.txt')">respect</a> to Mr.
_Spectator's_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec553.txt')">Company</a>. For though they may brag, that you sometimes
make your personal Appearance amongst them, it is impossible they
should ever get a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec553.txt')">Word</a> from you. Whereas you are with us the Reverse
of what _Phædria_ would have his Mistress be in his Rival's Company,
_Present in your Absence_. We make you talk as much and as long as we
please; and let me tell you, you seldom hold your Tongue for the whole
Evening. I promise my self you will look with an Eye of Favour upon a
Meeting which owes its Original to a mutual Emulation among its
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec553.txt')">Members</a>, who shall shew the most profound Respect for your Paper; not
but we have a very great Value for your Person: and I dare say you can
no where find four more sincere Admirers, and humble Servants, than
_T. F., G. S., J. T., E. T._</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
