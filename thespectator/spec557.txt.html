<p>No. 557.    From Friday, June 18 to Monday, June 21, 1714.     Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Quippe domum timet ambiguam, Tyriosque bilingues.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>_There is nothing, says Plato, so delightful, as the hearing or the
speaking of Truth_. For this Reason there is no <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec557.txt')">Conversation</a> so
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec557.txt')">agreeable</a> as that of the Man of Integrity, who hears without any
Intention to betray, and speaks without any Intention to deceive.</p><p>Among all the Accounts which are given of _Cato_, I do not remember one
that more redounds to his <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec557.txt')">Honour</a> than the following Passage related by
_Plutarch_. As an Advocate was pleading the Cause of his Client before
one of the Prætors, he could only produce a single Witness in a Point
where the Law required the Testimony of two Persons; upon which the
Advocate insisted on the Integrity of that Person whom he had produced:
but the Prætor told him, That where the Law required two Witnesses he
would not accept of one, tho' it were _Cato_ himself. Such a Speech from
a Person who sat at the Head of a <a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec557.txt')">Court</a> of Justice, while _Cato_ was
still living, shews us, more than a thousand Examples, the high
Reputation this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec557.txt')">great</a> Man had gained among his Contemporaries upon the
Account of his Sincerity.</p><p>When such an inflexible Integrity is a little softened and qualified by
the Rules of Conversation and Good-breeding, there is not a more shining
Virtue in the whole Catalogue of Social Duties. A Man however ought to
take great Care not to polish himself out of his Veracity, nor to refine
his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec557.txt')">Behaviour</a> to the Prejudice of his Virtue.</p><p>This Subject is exquisitely treated in the most elegant Sermon of the
great _British_ Preacher [1]. I shall beg Leave to transcribe out of it
two or three Sentences, as a proper Introduction to a very curious
Letter, which I shall make the chief Entertainment of this Speculation.</p><p>'The old _English_ Plainness and Sincerity, that generous Integrity of
Nature, and Honesty of Disposition, which always argues true Greatness
of Mind, and is usually accompanied with undaunted Courage and
Resolution, is in a great Measure lost among us.</p><p>'The Dialect of Conversation is now-a-days so swelled with Vanity and
Compliment, and so surfeited (as I may say) of Expressions of Kindness
and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec557.txt')">Respect</a>, that if a Man that lived an Age or two ago should return
into the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec557.txt')">World</a> again, he would really want a Dictionary to help him to
understand his own Language, and to know the true intrinsick Value of
the Phrase in Fashion; and would hardly, at first, believe at what a
low Rate the highest Strains and Expressions of Kindness imaginable do
commonly pass in current Payment; and when he should come to
understand it, it would be a great while before he could bring himself
with a good Countenance and a good Conscience, to converse with Men
upon equal Terms and in their own Way.'</p><p>I have by me a Letter which I look upon as a great Curiosity, and which
may serve as an Exemplification to the foregoing Passage, cited out of
this most excellent Prelate. It is said to have been written in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec557.txt')">King</a>
_<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec557.txt')">Charles</a>_ II.'s Reign by the Ambassador of _Bantam_ [2], a little after
his Arrival in _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec557.txt')">England</a>_.</p><p>
_Master_,</p><p>'The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec557.txt')">People</a>, where I now am, have Tongues further from their Hearts
than from _London_ to _Bantam_, and thou knowest the Inhabitants of
one of these Places does not know what is done in the other. They <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec557.txt')">call</a>
thee and thy <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec557.txt')">Subjects</a> Barbarians, because we <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec557.txt')">speak</a> what we mean; and
account themselves a civilized People, because they speak one thing
and mean another: Truth they call Barbarity, and Falsehood Politeness.
Upon my first landing, one who was sent from the King of this Place to
meet me told me, _That he was extremely sorry for the Storm I had met
with just before my Arrival_. I was troubled to hear him grieve and
afflict himself upon my Account; but in less than a Quarter of an Hour
he smiled, and was as merry as if nothing had happened. Another who
came with him told me by my Interpreter, _He should be glad to do me
any Service that lay in his Power_. Upon which I desir'd him to carry
one of my Portmantaus for me, but instead of serving me according to
his Promise, he laughed, and bid another do it. I lodged, the first
Week, at the House of one, who desired me _to think my self at home,
and to consider his House as my own_. Accordingly, I the next Morning
began to knock down one of the Walls of it, in order to let in the
fresh Air, and had packed up some of the Houshold-Goods, of which I
intended to have made thee a Present: But the false Varlet no sooner
saw me falling to Work, but he sent <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec557.txt')">Word</a> to desire me to give over,
for that he would have no such Doings in his House. I had not been
long in this Nation, before I was told by one, for whom I had asked a
certain Favour from the Chief of the King's Servants, whom they here
call the Lord-Treasurer, That I had _eternally obliged him_. I was so
surpriz'd at his Gratitude, that I could not forbear saying, What
Service is there which one Man can do for another, that can oblige him
to all Eternity! However I only asked him, for my Reward, that he
would lend me his eldest Daughter during my Stay in this Country; but
I quickly found that he was as treacherous as the rest of his
Countrymen.</p><p>'At my first going to Court, one of the great Men almost put me out of
Countenance, by asking _ten thousand Pardons_ of me for only treading
by Accident upon my Toe. They call this kind of Lye a Compliment; for
when they are Civil to a great Man, they tell him Untruths, for which
thou wouldst order any of thy Officers of State to receive a hundred
Blows upon his Foot. I do not know how I shall negociate any thing
with this People, since there is so little Credit to be given to 'em.
When I go to see the King's Scribe, I am generally told that he is not
at home, tho' perhaps I saw him go into his House almost the very
Moment before. Thou wouldest fancy that the whole Nation are
Physicians, for the first Question they always ask me, is, _how I do_:
I have this Question put to me above a hundred times a Day. Nay, they
are not only thus inquisitive after my Health, but wish it in a more
solemn <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec557.txt')">Manner</a>, with a full Glass in their Hands, every time I sit with
them at Table, tho' at the same time they would perswade me to drink
their Liquors in such Quantities as I have found by Experience will
make me sick. They often pretend to pray for thy Health also in the
same Manner; but I have more Reason to expect it from the Goodness of
thy Constitution, than the Sincerity of their Wishes. May thy Slave
escape in Safety from this doubled-tongued Race of Men, and live to
lay himself once more at thy Feet in thy Royal City of _Bantam_.'</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Tillotson. The Sermon 'Of Sincerity Towards God and Man.'
