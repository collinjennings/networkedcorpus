<p>No. 560.              Monday, June 28, 1714.                   Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Verba intermissa retentat.'</p><p>Ov. Met.</p><p></p><p>Every one has heard of the Famous Conjurer, who, according to the
Opinion of the Vulgar, has studied himself _dumb_; for which Reason, as
it is believed, he delivers out all his Oracles in Writing. Be that as
it will, the blind _Tiresias_ was not more famous in _Greece_, than this
dumb Artist has been, for some Years last past, in the Cities of
_London_ and _Westminster_. Thus much for the profound Gentleman who
honours me with the following Epistle.</p><p>
_From my Cell_, June 24, 1714.</p><p>_SIR,_</p><p>'Being informed that you have lately got the Use of your Tongue, I
have some Thoughts of following your Example, that I may be a
_Fortune-teller_ properly speaking. I am grown weary of my
Taciturnity, and having served my Country many Years under the Title
of the dumb Doctor, I shall now prophesie by <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec560.txt')">Word</a> of Mouth, and (as
Mr. _Lee_ says of the Magpie, who you know was a great Fortune-teller
among the Ancients) _chatter_ Futurity. I have hitherto chosen to
receive Questions and return Answers in Writing, that I might avoid
the Tediousness and Trouble of Debates, my Querists being generally of
a Humour to think, that they have never Predictions enough for their
Mony. In short, Sir, my Case has been something like that of those
discreet Animals the Monkeys, who, as the _Indians_ tell us, can <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec560.txt')">speak</a>
if they would, but purposely avoid it that they may not be made to
work. I have hitherto gained a Livelyhood by holding my Tongue, but
shall now open my Mouth in order to fill it. If I appear a little
Word-bound in my first Solutions and Responses, I hope it will not be
imputed to any Want of Foresight, but to the long Disuse of Speech. I
doubt not by this Invention to have all my former Customers over
again, for if I have promised any of them Lovers or Husbands, Riches
or good Luck, it is my Design to confirm to them _viv√¢ voce_, what I
have already given them under my Hand. If you will honour me with a
Visit, I will compliment you with the first opening of my Mouth, and
if you please you may make an entertaining Dialogue out of the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec560.txt')">Conversation</a> of two dumb Men. Excuse this Trouble, worthy Sir, from
one who has been a long time</p><p>_Your Silent Admirer_,
Cornelius Agrippa.'</p><p>
I have received the following Letter, or rather _Billet-doux_, from a
pert young Baggage, who congratulates with me upon the same Occasion.</p><p>
_June 23, 1714._</p><p>_Dear Mr._ Prate-apace,</p><p>'I am a <a name="topic46" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec560.txt')">Member</a> of a Female <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec560.txt')">Society</a> who <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec560.txt')">call</a> ourselves the _Chit-Chat_
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec560.txt')">Club</a>, and am ordered by the whole Sisterhood, to congratulate you upon
the Use of your Tongue. We have all of us a mighty Mind to hear you
talk, and if you will take your Place among us for an Evening, we have
unanimously agreed to allow you one Minute in ten, without
Interruption.</p><p>_I am, SIR,
Your Humble Servant,_
S. T.</p><p>P. S. '_You may find us at my Lady Betty_ Clack's, _who will leave
Orders with her Porter, that if an elderly Gentleman, with a short
Face, enquires for her, he shall be admitted and no Questions asked._</p><p>
As this particular Paper shall consist wholly of what I have received
from my Correspondents, I shall fill up the remaining Part of it with
other congratulatory Letters of the same Nature.</p><p>
_Oxford, June 25, 1714._</p><p>_SIR,_</p><p>'We are here wonderfully pleased with the Opening of your Mouth, and
very frequently open ours in Approbation of your Design; especially
since we find you are resolved to preserve your Taciturnity as to all
Party Matters. We do not question but you are as great an Orator as
Sir _Hudibras_, of whom the Poet sweetly sings,</p><p>'--He could not ope
His Mouth, but out there flew a Trope.'</p><p>'If you will send us down the Half-dozen well-turned Periods, that
produced such dismal Effects in your Muscles, we will deposite them
near an old Manuscript of _Tully's_ Orations, among the Archives of
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec560.txt')">University</a>; for we all agree with you, that there is not a more
remarkable Accident recorded in History, since that which happened to
the Son of _Croesus_, nay, I believe you might have gone higher, and
have added _Balaam's_ Ass. We are impatient to see more of your
Productions, and expect what Words will next fall from you, with as
much attention as those, who were set to watch the speaking Head which
Friar _Bacon_ formerly erected in this Place.
We are,</p><p>_Worthy SIR_,
_Your most humble Servants_,
B. R. T. D., &c.</p><p></p><p>_Honest_ SPEC.</p><p>_Middle-Temple, June 24_.</p><p>'I am very glad to hear that thou beginnest to prate; and find, by thy
Yesterday's Vision, thou art so used to it, that thou canst not
forbear talking in thy Sleep. Let me only advise thee to speak like
other Men, for I am afraid thou wilt be very Queer, if thou dost not
intend to use the Phrases in Fashion, as thou callest them in thy
Second Paper. Hast thou a Mind to pass for a _Bantamite_, or to make
us all _Quakers_? I do assure thee, Dear SPEC, I am not Polished out
of my Veracity, when I subscribe my self</p><p>_Thy Constant Admirer,
and humble Servant,_
Frank Townly.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
