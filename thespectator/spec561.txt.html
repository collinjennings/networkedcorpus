<p>No. 561.               Wednesday, June 30, 1714.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Paulatim abolere Sichæum
Incipit, et vivo tentat prævertere amore
Jampridem resides animos desuetaque corda.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>SIR,</p><p>'I am a tall, broad-shoulder'd, impudent, black Fellow, and, as I
thought, every way qualified for a <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec561.txt')">rich</a> Widow: But, after having tried
my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec561.txt')">Fortune</a> for above three Years together, I have not been able to get
one single Relict in the Mind. My first Attacks were generally
successful, but always broke off as soon as they came to the Word
_Settlement_. Though I have not improved my Fortune this way, I have
my Experience, and have learnt several Secrets which may be of use to
those unhappy Gentlemen, who are commonly distinguished by the Name of
Widow-hunters, and who do not know that this Tribe of <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec561.txt')">Women</a> are,
generally speaking, as much upon the Catch as themselves. I shall here
communicate to you the Mysteries of a certain Female Cabal of this
Order, who call themselves the _Widow-<a name="topic46" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec561.txt')">Club</a>_. This Club consists of
nine experienced Dames, who take their Places once a Week round a
large oval Table.</p><p>I. Mrs. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec561.txt')">President</a> is a Person who has disposed of six <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec561.txt')">Husbands</a>, and is
now determined to take a seventh; being of Opinion that there is as
much Vertue in the Touch of a seventh <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec561.txt')">Husband</a> as of a seventh Son. Her
Comrades are as follow.</p><p>II. Mrs. _Snapp_, who has four Jointures, by four different
Bed-fellows, of four different Shires. She is at present upon the
Point of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec561.txt')">Marriage</a> with a _Middlesex_ Man, and is said to have an
Ambition of extending her Possessions through all the Counties in
_England_ on this Side the _Trent_.</p><p>III. Mrs. _Medlar_, who after two Husbands and a Gallant, is now
wedded to an old Gentleman of Sixty. Upon her making her Report to the
Club after a Weeks Cohabitation, she is still allowed to sit as a
Widow, and accordingly takes her Place at the Board.</p><p>IV. The Widow _Quick_, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec561.txt')">married</a> within a Fortnight after the Death of
her last Husband. Her _Weeds_ have served her thrice, and are still as
good as new.</p><p>V. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec561.txt')">Lady</a> _Catherine Swallow_. She was a Widow at Eighteen, and has
since buried a second Husband and two Coachmen.</p><p>VI. The Lady _Waddle_. She was married in the 15th Year of her Age to
Sir _Simon Waddle_, Knight, aged Threescore and Twelve, by whom she
had Twinns nine Months after his Decease. In the 55th Year of her Age
she was married to _James Spindle_, Esq.; a Youth of One and Twenty,
who did not out-live the Honey-Moon.</p><p>VII. _Deborah Conquest_. The Case of this Lady is something
particular. She is the Relict of _Sir Sampson Conquest_, some time
Justice of the _Quorum_. Sir _Sampson_ was seven Foot high, and two
Foot in Breadth from the Tip of one Shoulder to the other. He had
married three Wives, who all of them died in Child-bed. This terrified
the whole Sex, who none of them durst venture on Sir _Sampson_. At
length Mrs. _Deborah_ undertook him, and gave so good an Account of
him, that in three Years time she very fairly laid him out, and
measured his Length upon the Ground. This Exploit has gained her so
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec561.txt')">great</a> a Reputation in the Club, that they have added Sir _Sampson's_
three Victories to hers, and give her the Merit of a fourth Widowhood;
and she takes her Place accordingly.</p><p>'VIII. The Widow _Wildfire_, Relict of Mr. _John Wildfire_,
Fox-hunter, who broke his Neck over a six Bar Gate. She took his Death
so much to Heart, that it was thought it would have put an End to her
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec561.txt')">Life</a>, had she not diverted her Sorrows by receiving the Addresses of a
Gentleman in the Neighbourhood, who made <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec561.txt')">Love</a> to her in the second
Month of her Widowhood. This Gentleman was discarded in a Fortnight
for the sake of a young _Templar_, who had the Possession of her for
six Weeks after, till he was beaten out by a broken Officer, who
likewise gave up his Place to a Gentleman at Court. The Courtier was
as short-liv'd a Favourite as his Predecessors, but had the Pleasure
to see himself succeeded by a long Series of Lovers, who followed the
Widow _Wildfire_ to the 37th Year of her Age, at which time there
ensued a Cessation of ten Years, when _John Felt_, Haberdasher, took
it in his Head to be in love with her, and it is thought will very
suddenly carry her off.</p><p>'IX. The last is pretty Mrs. _Runnet_, who broke her first Husband's
Heart before she was Sixteen, at which Time she was entred of the
Club, but soon after left it, upon Account of a Second, whom she made
so quick a Dispatch of, that she returned to her Seat in less than a
Twelvemonth. This young Matron is looked upon as the most rising
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec561.txt')">Member</a> of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec561.txt')">Society</a>, and will probably be in the President's Chair
before she dies.</p><p>'These Ladies, upon their first Institution, resolved to give the
Pictures of their deceased Husbands to the Club-Room, but two of them
bringing in their Dead at full Length, they cover'd all the Walls;
Upon which they came to a second Resolution, that every Matron should
give her own Picture, and set it round with her Husbands in Miniature.</p><p>As they have most of them the Misfortune to be troubled with the
Cholick, they have a noble Celler of Cordials and strong Waters. When
they grow Maudlin, they are very apt to commemorate their former
Partners with a Tear. But ask them which of their Husbands they
Condole, they are not able to tell you, and discover plainly that they
do not Weep so much for the Loss of a Husband, as for the want of One.</p><p>'The principal Rule, by which the whole Society are to govern
themselves is this, To cry up the Pleasures of a single Life upon all
Occasions, in order to deter the rest of their Sex from Marriage, and
engross the whole Male World to themselves.</p><p>'They are obliged, when any one makes Love to a Member of the Society,
to communicate his Name, at which Time the whole Assembly sit upon his
Reputation, Person, Fortune, and good Humour; and if they find him
qualified for a Sister of the Club, they lay their Heads together how
to make him sure. By this Means they are acquainted with all the
Widow-hunters about Town, who often afford them great Diversion. There
is an honest _Irish_ Gentleman, it seems, who knows nothing of this
Society, but at different times has made Love to the whole Club.</p><p>Their Conversation often turns upon their former Husbands, and it is
very diverting to hear them relate their several Arts and Stratagems,
with which they amused the Jealous, pacified the Chokrick, or wheedled
the Good-natured Man, till at last, to use the Club Phrase, _They sent
him out of the House with his Heels foremost_.</p><p>The Politicks, which are most cultivated by this Society of
She-_Machiavils_, relate chiefly to these two Points: How to treat a
Lover, and How to manage a Husband. As for the first Set of Artifices,
they are too numerous to come within the Compass of your Paper, and
shall therefore be reserved for a Second Letter.</p><p>The Management of a Husband is built upon the following Doctrines,
which are Universally assented to by the whole Club. Not to give him
his Head at first. Not to allow him too great Freedoms and
Familiarities. Not to be treated by him like a raw Girl, but as a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec561.txt')">Woman</a> that knows the World. Not to Lessen anything of her former
Figure. To celebrate the Generosity, or any other Vertue, of a
deceased Husband, which she would recommend to his Successor. To turn
away all his old Friends and Servants, that she may have the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec561.txt')">Dear</a> Man
to her self. To make him disinherit the undutiful Children of any
former <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec561.txt')">Wife</a>. Never to be thoroughly convinced of his Affection, till
he has made over to her all his Goods and Chattels.</p><p>'After so long a Letter, I am, without more Ceremony,
_Your Humble Servant, &c._</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
