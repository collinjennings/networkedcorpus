<p>No. 562.                Friday, July 2, 1714.                  Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Præsens, absens ut sies.'</p><p>Ter.</p><p></p><p>_It is a hard and nice Subject for a Man to <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec562.txt')">speak</a> of himself, says
Cowley; [1] it grates his own <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec562.txt')">Heart</a> to say anything of Disparagement,
and the Reader's Ears to hear any thing of Praise from him._ Let the
Tenour of his Discourse be what it will upon this Subject, it generally
proceeds from _Vanity_. An ostentatious Man will rather relate a Blunder
or an Absurdity he has committed, than be debarred from talking of his
own dear Person.</p><p>Some very <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec562.txt')">great</a> <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec562.txt')">Writers</a> have been <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec562.txt')">guilty</a> of this Fault. It is observed
of _Tully_ in particular, that his Works run very much in the First
Person, and that he takes all Occasions of doing himself Justice.</p><p>'Does he think, says _Brutus_, that his Consulship deserves more
Applause than my putting _Cæ<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec562.txt')">sar</a>_ to Death, because I am not
perpetually talking of the Ides of _March_, as he is of the Nones of
_December_?'</p><p>I need not acquaint my learned Reader, that in the Ides of _March,
Brutus_ destroyed _Cæsar_, and that _Cicero_ quashed the Conspiracy of
_Cataline_ in the Calends of _December_. How shocking soever this great
Man's talking of himself might have been to his Contemporaries, I must
confess I am never better pleased than when he is on this Subject. Such
Openings of the Heart give a Man a thorough Insight into his Personal
Character, and illustrate several Passages in the History of his Life:
Besides that, there is some little Pleasure in discovering the Infirmity
of a great Man, and seeing how the Opinion he has of himself agrees with
what the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec562.txt')">World</a> entertains of him.</p><p>The Gentlemen of _Port-Royal_, who were more eminent for their Learning
and their Humility than any other in _France_, banish'd the way of
speaking in the First Person out of all their Works, as arising from
Vain-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec562.txt')">Glory</a> and Self-Conceit. To shew their particular Aversion to it,
they branded this Form of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec562.txt')">Writing</a> with the Name of an _Egotism_; a
Figure not to be found among the ancient Rhetoricians.</p><p>The most violent Egotism which I have met with in the Course of my
Reading, is that of Cardinal _Wolsey, Ego et Rex meus, I and my King_;
as perhaps the most eminent Egotist that ever appeared in the World, was
_Montagne_ the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec562.txt')">Author</a> of the celebrated Essays. This lively old _Gascon_
has woven all his bodily Infirmities into his Works, and after having
spoken of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec562.txt')">Faults</a> or Virtues of any other Man, immediately publishes
to the World how it stands with himself in that Particular. Had he kept
his own Counsel he might have passed for a much better Man, though
perhaps he would not have been so diverting an Author. The Title of an
Essay promises perhaps a Discourse upon _Virgil_ or _Julius Cæsar_; but
when you look into it, you are sure to meet with more upon Monsieur
_Montagne_, than of either of them. The younger _Scaliger_, who seems to
have been no great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec562.txt')">Friend</a> to this Author, after having acquainted the
World that his Father sold Herrings, adds these <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec562.txt')">Words</a>; _La grande
fadaise de Montague, qui a escrit, qu'il aimoit mieux le vin blanc--que
diable a-t-on a faire de scavoir ce qu'il aime? For my Part, says
Montague, I am a great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec562.txt')">Lover</a> of your White Wines--What the Devil
signifies it to the Publick, says Scaliger, whether he is a Lover of
White Wines or of Red Wines?_</p><p>I cannot here forbear mentioning a Tribe of Egotists for whom I have
always had a mortal Aversion, I mean the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec562.txt')">Authors</a> of Memoirs, who are
never mentioned in any Works but their own, and who raise all their
Productions out of this single Figure of Speech.</p><p>Most of our modern Prefaces savour very strongly of the Egotism. Every
insignificant Author fancies it of Importance to the World, to know that
he writ his Book in the Country, that he did it to pass away some of his
idle Hours, that it was published at the Importunity of Friends, or that
his natural Temper, Studies or Conversations, directed him to the Choice
of his Subject.</p><p>'--Id populus curat scilicet.'</p><p>Such Informations cannot but be highly improving to the Reader.</p><p>In Works of Humour, especially when a Man writes under a fictitious
Personage, the talking of one's self may give some Diversion to the
Publick; but I would advise every other Writer never to speak of
himself, unless there be something very considerable in his Character:
Tho' I am sensible this Rule will be of little Use in the World, because
there is no Man who fancies his Thoughts worth publishing, that does not
look upon himself as a considerable Person.</p><p>I shall close this Paper with a Remark upon such as are Egotists in
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec562.txt')">Conversation</a>: These are generally the vain or shallow part of Mankind,
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec562.txt')">People</a> being naturally full of themselves when they have nothing else in
them. There is one <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec562.txt')">kind</a> of Egotists which is very common in the World,
tho' I do not remember that any Writer has taken Notice of them; I mean
those empty conceited Fellows, who repeat as Sayings of their own, or
some of their particular Friends, several Jests which were made before
they were born, and which every one who has conversed in the World has
heard a hundred times over. A forward young Fellow of my Acquaintance
was very guilty of this Absurdity: He would be always laying a new Scene
for some old Piece of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec562.txt')">Wit</a>, and telling us, That as he and _Jack_
such-a-one were together, one or t'other of them had such a Conceit on
such an Occasion; upon which he would laugh very heartily, and wonder
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec562.txt')">Company</a> did not join with him. When his Mirth was over, I have often
reprehended him out of _Terence, Tuumne, obsecro te, hoc dictum erat?
vetus credidi_. But finding him still incorrigible, and having a
Kindness for the young Coxcomb, who was otherwise a good-natured Fellow,
I recommended to his Perusal the _Oxford_ and _Cambridge_ Jests, with
several little Pieces of Pleasantry of the same Nature. Upon the reading
of them, he was under no small Confusion to find that all his Jokes had
passed through several Editions, and that what he thought was a new
Conceit, and had appropriated to his own Use, had appeared in Print
before he or his ingenious Friends were ever heard of. This had so good
an Effect upon him, that he is content at present to pass for a Man of
plain Sense in his ordinary Conversation, and is never facetious but
when he knows his Company.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Essay 2.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
