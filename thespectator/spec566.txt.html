<p>No. 566.                  Monday, July 12, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'Militia Species Amor est.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>As my Correspondents begin to grow <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec566.txt')">pretty</a> numerous, I think my self
obliged to take some Notice of them, and shall therefore make this Paper
a Miscellany of Letters. I have, since my reassuming the Office of
SPECTATOR, received abundance of Epistles from Gentlemen of the Blade,
who, I find, have been so used to Action that they know not how to lie
still: They seem generally to be of Opinion, that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec566.txt')">Fair</a> at home ought
to reward them for their Services abroad, and that, till the Cause of
their Country calls them again into the Field, they have a sort of Right
to Quarter themselves upon the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec566.txt')">Ladies</a>. In Order to favour their
Approaches, I am desired by some to enlarge upon the Accomplishments of
their Profession, and by others to give them my Advice in the carrying
on of their Attacks. But let us hear what the Gentlemen say for
themselves.</p><p>
Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Tho' it may look somewhat perverse amidst the Arts of Peace, to talk
too much of <a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec566.txt')">War</a>, it is but Gratitude to pay the last Office to its
_Manes_, since even Peace it self is, in some Measure, obliged to it
for its Being.</p><p>'You have, in your former Papers, always recommended the Accomplished
to the Favour of the Fair; and, I hope, you will allow me to represent
some Part of a Military Life not altogether unnecessary to the forming
a Gentleman. I need not tell you that in _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec566.txt')">France</a>_, whose Fashions we
have been formerly so fond of, almost every one derives his Pretences
to <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec566.txt')">Merit</a> from the Sword; and that a Man has scarce the Face to make
his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec566.txt')">Court</a> to a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec566.txt')">Lady</a>, without some Credentials from the Service to
recommend him. As the Profession is very ancient, we have Reason to
think some of the greatest Men, among the old _Romans_, derived many
of their Virtues from it, their Commanders being frequently, in other
Respects, some of the most shining Characters of the Age.</p><p>'The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec566.txt')">Army</a> not only gives a Man Opportunities of exercising those two
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec566.txt')">great</a> Virtues _Patience_ and _Courage_, but often produces them in
Minds where they had scarce any Footing before. I must add, that it is
one of the best Schools in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec566.txt')">World</a> to receive a general Notion of
Mankind in, and a certain Freedom of <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec566.txt')">Behaviour</a>, which is not so easily
acquired in any other Place. At the same Time I must own, that some
Military Airs are pretty extraordinary, and that a Man who goes into
the Army a Coxcomb will come out of it a Sort of Publick Nuisance: But
a Man of Sense, or one who before had not been sufficiently used to a
mixed <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec566.txt')">Conversation</a>, generally takes the true Turn. The Court has in
all Ages been allowed to be the Standard of Good-breeding; and I
believe there is not a juster Observation in Monsieur _Rochefoucault_,
than that</p><p>'A Man who has been bred up wholly to Business, can never get the
Air of a Courtier at Court, but will immediately catch it in the
Camp.'</p><p>The Reason of this most certainly is, that the very Essence of
Good-Breeding and Politeness consists in several Niceties, which are
so minute that they escape his Observation, and he falls short of the
Original he would copy after; but when he sees the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec566.txt')">Things</a> charged
and aggravated to a Fault, he no sooner endeavours to come up to the
Pattern which is set before him, than, though he stops somewhat short
of that, he naturally rests where in reality he ought. I was two or
three Days ago, mightily pleased with the Observation of an humourous
Gentleman upon one of his Friends, who was in other Respects every way
an accomplished Person, That _he wanted nothing but a Dash of the
Coxcomb in him;_ by which he understood a little of that Alertness and
Unconcern in the common Actions of Life, which is usually so visible
among Gentlemen of the Army, and which a Campaign or two would
infallibly have given him.</p><p>'You will easily guess, Sir, by this my Panegyrick upon a Military
Education, that I am my self a Soldier, and indeed I am so; I
remember, within three Years after I had been in the Army, I was
ordered into the Country a Recruiting. I had very particular Success
in this Part of the Service, and was over and above assured, at my
going away, that I might have taken a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec566.txt')">young</a> Lady, who was the most
considerable Fortune in the County, along with me. I preferred the
Pursuit of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec566.txt')">Fame</a> at that time to all other Considerations, and tho' I
was not absolutely bent on a Wooden Leg, resolved at least to get a
Scar or two for the good of _Europe_. I have at present as much as I
desire of this Sort of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec566.txt')">Honour</a>, and if you could recommend me
effectually, should be well enough contented to pass the Remainder of
my Days in the Arms of some dear kind Creature, and upon a pretty
Estate in the Country: This, as I take it, would be following the
Example of _Lucius Cincinnatus_, the old _Roman_ Dictator, who at the
End of a War left the Camp to follow the Plow. I am, Sir, with all
imaginable <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec566.txt')">Respect</a>,</p><p>_Your most Obedient,
Humble Servant_,</p><p>Will. Warly.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I am an Half-pay Officer, and am at present with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec566.txt')">Friend</a> in the
Country. Here is a rich Widow in the Neighbourhood, who has made Fools
of all the Fox-hunters within fifty Miles of her. She declares she
intends to marry, but has not yet been asked by the Man she could
like. She usually admits her humble Admirers to an Audience or two,
but, after she has once given them Denial will never see them more. I
am assured by a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec566.txt')">Female</a> Relation, that I shall have fair Play at her;
but as my whole Success Depends on my first Approaches, I desire your
Advice, whether I had best _Storm_ or proceed by way of _Sap_.</p><p>_I am, SIR, Yours, &c._</p><p>'P. S. I had forgot to tell you, that I have already carried one of
her Outworks, that is, secured her Maid.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I have assisted in several Sieges in the _Low-Countries_, and being
still willing to employ my Talents, as a Soldier and Engineer, lay
down this Morning at Seven a Clock before the Door of an obstinate
Female, who had for some time refused me Admittance. I made a Lodgment
in an outer Parlour about Twelve: The Enemy retired to her
Bed-Chamber, yet I still pursued, and about two a-Clock this Afternoon
she thought fit to Capitulate. Her Demands are indeed somewhat high,
in Relation to the Settlement of her Fortune. But being in Possession
of the House, I intend to insist upon _Carte-Blanche_, and am in
hopes, by keeping off all other Pretenders for the Space of twenty
four Hours, to starve her into a Compliance. I beg your speedy Advice,
and am,</p><p>_SIR, Yours_, Peter Push.</p><p>From my Camp in _Red-Lion_ Square, Saturday_ 4, in the Afternoon.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
