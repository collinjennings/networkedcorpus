<p>No. 567.               Wednesday, July 14, 1714.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Inceptus clamor frustratur hiantes.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>I have received private Advice from some of my Correspondents, that if I
would give my Paper a general Run, I should take care to season it with
Scandal. I have indeed observed of late, that few Writings sell which
are not filled with <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec567.txt')">great</a> Names and illustrious Titles. The Reader
generally casts his Eye upon a new Book, and if he finds several Letters
separated from one another by a Dash, he buys it up, and peruses it with
great Satisfaction. An _M_ and an _h_, a _T_ and an _r_ [1], with a
short Line between them, has sold many an Insipid Pamphlet. Nay I have
known a whole Edition go off by vertue of two or three well written
&c--'s.</p><p>A sprinkling of the <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec567.txt')">Words</a> _Faction, Frenchman, Papist, Plunderer,_ and
the like significant Terms, in an Italick Character, have also a very
good Effect upon the Eye of the [Purchaser; [2]] not to mention
_Scribler, Lier, Rogue, Rascal, Knave,_ and _Villain_, without which it
is impossible to carry on a Modern Controversie.</p><p>Our <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec567.txt')">Party</a>-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec567.txt')">writers</a> are so sensible of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec567.txt')">secret</a> Vertue of an Innuendo to
recommend their Productions, that of late they never mention the Q--n or
P--l at length, though they <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec567.txt')">speak</a> of them with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec567.txt')">Honour</a>, and with that
Deference which is due to them from every private Person. It gives a
secret Satisfaction to a Peruser of these mysterious Works, that he is
able to decipher them without help, and, by the Strength of his own
natural Parts, to fill up a Blank-Space, or make out a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec567.txt')">Word</a> that has
only the first or last Letter to it.</p><p>Some of our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec567.txt')">Authors</a> indeed, when they would be more Satyrical than
ordinary, omit only the Vowels of a great Man's Name, and fall most
unmercifully upon all the Consonants. This way of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec567.txt')">Writing</a> was first of
all introduced by _T-m Br-wn_, of facetious Memory, who, after having
gutted a proper Name of all its intermediate Vowels, used to plant it in
his Works, and make as free with it as he pleased, without any Danger of
the Statute.</p><p>That I may imitate these celebrated Authors, and publish a Paper which
shall be more taking than ordinary, I have here drawn up a very curious
Libel, in which a Reader of Penetration will find a great deal of
concealed Satyr, and if he be acquainted with the present Posture of
Affairs, will easily discover the Meaning of it.</p><p>'If there are _four_ Persons in the Nation who endeavour to bring all
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec567.txt')">things</a> into Confusion, and ruin their native <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec567.txt')">Country</a>, I think every
honest _Engl-shm-n_ ought to be upon his Guard. That there are such,
every one will agree with me, who hears me name *** with his first
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec567.txt')">Friend</a> and Favourite ***, not to mention *** nor ***. These <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec567.txt')">People</a> may
cry Ch-rch, Ch-rch, as long as they please, but, to make use of a homely
Proverb, The Proof of the P-dd-ng is in the eating. This I am sure of,
that if a _certain Prince_ should concur with a _certain Prelate_, (and
we have Monsieur Z--n's Word for it) our Posterity would be in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec567.txt')">sweet</a>
P-ckle. Must the _British_ Nation suffer forsooth, because my Lady
_Q-p-t-s_ has been disobliged? Or is it reasonable that our _English_
Fleet, which used to be the Terror of the Ocean, should lie Windbound
for the sake of a--. I love to speak out and declare my Mind clearly,
when I am talking for the Good of my Country. I will not make my Court
to an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec567.txt')">ill</a> Man, tho' he were a B--y or a T--t. Nay, I would not stick to
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec567.txt')">call</a> so wretched a Politician, a Traitor, an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec567.txt')">Enemy</a> to his Country, and a
Bl-nd-rb-ss, &c., &c.</p><p>The remaining Part of this Political Treatise, which is written after
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec567.txt')">manner</a> of the most celebrated Authors in _Great Britain_, I may
communicate to the Publick at a more convenient Season. In the mean
while I shall leave this with my curious Reader, as some ingenious
Writers do their Enigmas, and if any sagacious Person can fairly
unriddle it, I will print his Explanation, and, if he pleases, acquaint
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec567.txt')">World</a> with his Name.</p><p>I hope this short Essay will convince my Readers, it is not for want of
Abilities that I avoid State-tracts, and that if I would apply my Mind
to it, I might in a little time be as great a Master of the Political
Scratch as any the most eminent Writer of the Age. I shall only add,
that in order to outshine all this Modern Race of _Syncopists_, and
thoroughly content my _English_ Readers, I intend shortly to publish a
SPECTATOR, that shall not have a single Vowel in it.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: For 'Marlborough' and 'Treasurer.']</p><p>
