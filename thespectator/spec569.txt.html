<p>No. 569.                 Monday, July 19, 1714.                Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Reges dicuntur multis urgere culullis
Et torquere mero, quem perspexisse laborent,
An sit amicitia dignus--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>No Vices are so incurable as those which Men are apt to glory in. One
would wonder how Drunkenness should have the good Luck to be of this
Number. _Anacharsis_, being invited to a Match of Drinking at _Corinth_,
demanded the Prize very humorously, because he was drunk before any of
the rest of the <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec569.txt')">Company</a>: for, says he, when we run a Race, he who
arrives at the Goal first is entitled to the Reward. On the contrary, in
this thirsty Generation, the Honour falls upon him who carries off the
greatest Quantity of Liquor, and knocks down the rest of the Company. I
was the other Day with honest _Will. Funnell_ the _West Saxon_, who was
reckoning up how much Liquor had past through him in the last twenty
Years of his Life, which, according to his Computation, amounted to
twenty three Hogsheads of October, four Ton of Port, half a Kilderkin of
small Beer, nineteen Barrels of Cider, and three Glasses of Champaign;
besides which, he had assisted at four hundred Bowls of Punch, not to
mention Sips, Drams, and Whets without Number. I question not but every
Reader's Memory will suggest to him several ambitious young Men, who are
as vain in this Particular as _Will. Funnell_, and can boast of as
glorious Exploits.</p><p>Our modern Philosophers observe, that there is a general Decay of
Moisture in the Globe of the Earth. This they chiefly ascribe to the
Growth of Vegetables, which incorporate into their own Substance many
fluid Bodies that never return again to their former <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec569.txt')">Nature</a>: But, with
Submission, they ought to throw into their Account those innumerable
rational Beings which fetch their Nourishment chiefly out of Liquids;
especially when we consider that Men, compared with their
Fellow-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec569.txt')">Creatures</a>, drink much more than comes to their Share.</p><p>But however highly this Tribe of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec569.txt')">People</a> may think of themselves, a
drunken <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec569.txt')">Man</a> is a greater Monster than any that is to be found among all
the Creatures which God has made; as indeed there is no Character which
appears more despicable and deformed, in the Eyes of all reasonable
Persons, than that of a Drunkard. _Bonosus_, one of our own Countrymen,
who was addicted to this <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec569.txt')">Vice</a>, having set up for a Share in the Roman
Empire, and being defeated in a great Battle, hang'd himself. When he
was seen by the Army in this melancholy Situation, notwithstanding he
had behaved himself very bravely, the common Jest was, That the Thing
they saw hanging upon the Tree before them, was not a Man but a Bottle.
This Vice has very fatal Efects on the Mind, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec569.txt')">Body</a>, and Fortune of
the Person who is devoted to it.</p><p>In regard to the Mind, it first of all discovers every Flaw in it. The
sober Man, by the Strength of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec569.txt')">Reason</a>, may keep under and subdue every
Vice or Folly to which he is most inclined; but Wine makes every latent
Seed sprout up in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec569.txt')">Soul</a>, and <a name="topic26" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('26', 'spec569.txt')">shew</a> it self. It gives Fury to the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec569.txt')">Passions</a>, and Force to those Objects which are apt to produce them.
When a young Fellow complained to an old Philosopher that his Wife was
not handsome, _Put less Water in your Wine, says the Philosopher, and
you'll quickly make her so_. Wine heightens Indifference into Love, Love
into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('26', 'spec569.txt')">Jealousy</a>, and Jealousy into Madness. It often turns the
Good-natured Man into an Ideot, and the Cholerick into an Assassin. It
gives Bitterness to Resentment, it makes Vanity insupportable, and
displays every little Spot of the Soul in its utmost Deformity. Nor does
this Vice only betray the hidden <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec569.txt')">Faults</a> of a Man, and shew them in the
most odious Colours, but often occasions Faults to which he is not
naturally subject. There is more of Turn than of Truth in a Saying of
Seneca, That Drunkenness does not produce but discover Faults. Common
Experience teaches us the contrary. Wine throws a Man out of himself,
and infuses Qualities into the Mind, which she is a Stranger to in her
sober Moments. The Person you converse with, after the third Bottle, is
not the same Man who at first sat down at Table with you. Upon this
Maxim is founded one of the prettiest Sayings I ever met with, which is
ascribed to Publius Syrus, _Qui ebrium ludificat ladit absentem; He who
jests upon a Man that is Drunk, injures the Absent_.</p><p>Thus does Drunkenness act in direct Contradiction to Reason, whose
Business it is to clear the Mind of every Vice which is crept into it,
and to guard it against all the Approaches of any that endeavours to
make its Entrance. But besides these <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec569.txt')">ill</a> Effects which this Vice
produces in the Person who is actually under its Dominion, it has also a
bad Influence on the Mind even in its sober Moments, as it insensibly
weakens the Understanding, impairs the Memory, and makes those Faults
habitual which are produced by frequent Excesses.</p><p>I should now proceed to shew the ill Effects which this Vice has on the
Bodies and Fortunes of Men; but these I shall reserve for the Subject of
some future Paper.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
