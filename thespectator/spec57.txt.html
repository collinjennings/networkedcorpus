<p>No. 57.                Saturday, May 5, 1711.            Addison.</p><p>
'Quem præstare potest mulier galeata pudorem,
Quæ fugit à Sexu!'</p><p>Juv.</p><p>
When the Wife of _Hector_, in _Homer's Iliads_, discourses with her
Husband about the Battel in which he was going to engage, the Hero,
desiring her to leave that Matter to his Care, bids her go to her Maids
and mind her Spinning: [1] by which the Poet intimates, that Men and
<a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec57.txt')">Women</a> ought to busy themselves in their proper Spheres, and on such
Matters only as are suitable to their respective <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec57.txt')">Sex</a>.</p><p>I am at this time acquainted with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec57.txt')">young</a> Gentleman, who has passed a
great Part of his Life in the Nursery, and, upon Occasion, can make a
Caudle or a Sack-Posset better than any Man in _England_. He is likewise
a wonderful Critick in Cambrick and Muslins, and will talk an Hour
together upon a Sweet-meat. He entertains his Mother every Night with
Observations that he makes both in Town and Court: As what <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec57.txt')">Lady</a> shews
the nicest Fancy in her Dress; what Man of Quality wears the fairest
Whig; who has the finest Linnen, who the prettiest Snuff-box, with many
other the like curious Remarks that may be made in good <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec57.txt')">Company</a>.</p><p>On the other hand I have very frequently the Opportunity of seeing a
Rural _Andromache_, who came up to Town last Winter, and is one of the
greatest Fox-hunters in the Country. She talks of Hounds and Horses, and
makes nothing of leaping over a Six-bar Gate. If a Man tells her a
waggish Story, she gives him a Push with her Hand in jest, and calls him
an impudent Dog; and if her Servant neglects his Business, threatens to
kick him out of the House. I have heard her, in her Wrath, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec57.txt')">call</a> a
Substantial Trades-man a Lousy Cur; and remember one Day, when she could
not think of the Name of a Person, she described him in a large Company
of Men and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec57.txt')">Ladies</a>, by the Fellow with the Broad Shoulders.</p><p>If those Speeches and <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec57.txt')">Actions</a>, which in their own Nature are
indifferent, appear ridiculous when they proceed from a wrong Sex, the
<a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec57.txt')">Faults</a> and Imperfections of one Sex transplanted into another, appear
black and monstrous. As for the Men, I shall not in this Paper any
further concern my self about them: but as I would fain contribute to
make Womankind, which is the most beautiful Part of the Creation,
entirely amiable, and wear out all those little Spots and Blemishes that
are apt to rise among the Charms which Nature has poured out upon them,
I shall dedicate this Paper to their Service. The Spot which I would
here endeavour to clear them of, is that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec57.txt')">Party</a>-Rage which of late Years
is very much crept into their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec57.txt')">Conversation</a>. This is, in its Nature, a
Male <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec57.txt')">Vice</a>, and made up of many angry and cruel <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec57.txt')">Passions</a> that are
altogether repugnant to the Softness, the Modesty, and those other
endearing Qualities which are natural to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec57.txt')">Fair</a> Sex. Women were formed
to temper Mankind, and sooth them into Tenderness and Compassion, not to
set an Edge upon their Minds, and blow up in them those Passions which
are too apt to rise of their own Accord. When I have seen a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec57.txt')">pretty</a> Mouth
uttering Calumnies and Invectives, what would not I have given to have
stopt it? How have I been troubled to see some of the finest Features in
the World grow pale, and tremble with Party-Rage? _Camilla_ is one of
the greatest Beauties in the _British_ Nation, and yet values her self
more upon being the _Virago_ of one Party, than upon being the Toast of
both. The Dear Creature, about a Week ago, encountered the fierce and
beautiful _Penthesilea_ across a Tea-Table; but in the Height of her
Anger, as her Hand chanced to shake with the Earnestness of the Dispute,
she scalded her Fingers, and spilt a Dish of Tea upon her Petticoat. Had
not this Accident broke off the Debate, no Body knows where it would
have ended.</p><p>There is one Consideration which I would earnestly recommend to all my
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec57.txt')">Female</a> Readers, and which, I hope, will have some weight with them. In
short, it is this, that there is nothing so bad for the Face as
Party-Zeal. It gives an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec57.txt')">ill</a>-natured Cast to the Eye, and a disagreeable
Sourness to the Look; besides, that it makes the Lines too strong, and
flushes them worse than Brandy. I have seen a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec57.txt')">Woman</a>'s Face break out in
Heats, as she has been talking against a great Lord, whom she had never
seen in her Life; and indeed never knew a Party-Woman that kept her
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec57.txt')">Beauty</a> for a Twelvemonth. I would therefore advise all my Female
Readers, as they value their Complexions, to let alone all Disputes of
this Nature; though, at the same time, I would give free Liberty to all
superannuated motherly Partizans to be as violent as they please, since
there will be no Danger either of their spoiling their Faces, or of
their gaining Converts.</p><p>[2] For my own part, I think a Man makes an odious and despicable
Figure, that is violent in a Party: but a Woman is too sincere to
mitigate the Fury of her Principles with Temper and Discretion, and to
act with that Caution and Reservedness which are requisite in our Sex.
When this unnatural Zeal gets into them, it throws them into ten
thousand Heats and Extravagancies; their generous [Souls [3]] set no
Bounds to their Love or to their Hatred; and whether a Whig or Tory, a
Lap-Dog or a Gallant, an Opera or a Puppet-Show, be the Object of it,
the Passion, while it reigns, engrosses the whole Woman.</p><p>I remember when Dr. _Titus Oates_ [4] was in all his Glory, I
accompanied my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec57.txt')">Friend</a> WILL. [HONEYCOMB] [5] in a Visit to a Lady of his
Acquaintance: We were no sooner sat down, but upon casting my Eyes about
the Room, I found in almost every Corner of it a Print that represented
the Doctor in all Magnitudes and Dimensions. A little after, as the Lady
was discoursing my Friend, and held her Snuff-box in her Hand, who
should I see in the Lid of it but the Doctor. It was not long after
this, when she had Occasion for her Handkerchief, which upon the first
opening discovered among the Plaits of it the Figure of the Doctor. Upon
this my Friend WILL., who loves Raillery, told her, That if he was in
Mr. _Truelove's_ Place (for that was the Name for her Husband) she
should be made as uneasy by a Handkerchief as ever _Othello_ was. _I am
afraid,_ said she, _Mr._ [HONEYCOMB,[6]] _you are a Tory; tell me truly,
are you a Friend to the Doctor or not?_ WILL., instead of making her a
Reply, smiled in her Face (for indeed she was very pretty) and told her
that one of her Patches was dropping off. She immediately adjusted it,
and looking a little seriously, _Well_, says she, _I'll be hang'd if you
and your silent Friend there are not against the Doctor in your Hearts,
I suspected as much by his saying nothing_. Upon this she took her Fan
into her Hand, and upon the opening of it again displayed to us the
Figure of the Doctor, who was placed with great Gravity among the Sticks
of it. In a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec57.txt')">word</a>, I found that the Doctor had taken Possession of her
Thoughts, her Discourse, and most of her Furniture; but finding my self
pressed too close by her Question, I winked upon my Friend to take his
Leave, which he did accordingly.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Hector's parting from Andromache, at the close of Book VI.</p><p>No more--but hasten to thy tasks at home,
There guide the spindle, and direct the loom;
Me glory summons to the martial scene,
The field of combat is the sphere for men.]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: Not a new paragraph in the first issue.]</p><p>
[Footnote 3: "Souls (I mean those of ordinary Women)." This, however,
was cancelled by an Erratum in the next number.]</p><p>
[Footnote 4: Addison was six years old when Titus Oates began his
'Popish Plot' disclosures. Under a name which called up recollections of
the vilest trading upon theological intolerance, he here glances at Dr.
Henry Sacheverell, whose trial (Feb. 27-March 20, 1710) for his sermons
in praise of the divine right of kings and contempt of the Whigs, and
his sentence of suspension for three years, had caused him to be admired
enthusiastically by all party politicians who were of his own way of
thinking. The change of person pleasantly puts 'Tory' for 'Whig,' and
avoids party heat by implying a suggestion that excesses are not all on
one side. Sacheverell had been a College friend of Addison's. He is the
'dearest Harry' for whom, at the age of 22, Addison wrote his metrical
'Account of the greatest English Poets' which omitted Shakespeare from
the list.]</p><p>
