<p>No. 570.                  Wednesday, July 21, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Nugaque canora--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>There is scarce a Man living who is not actuated by <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec570.txt')">Ambition</a>. When this
Principle meets with an honest Mind and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec570.txt')">great</a> Abilities, it does
infinite Service to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec570.txt')">World</a>; on the contrary, when a Man only thinks
of distinguishing himself, without being thus qualified for it, he
becomes a very pernicious or a very ridiculous Creature. I shall here
confine my self to that petty kind of Ambition, by which some Men grow
eminent for odd Accomplishments and trivial Performances. How many are
there whose whole Reputation depends upon a Punn or a Quibble? You may
often see an Artist in the Streets gain a Circle of Admirers, by
carrying a long Pole upon his Chin or Forehead in a perpendicular
Posture. Ambition has taught some to write with their Feet, and others
to walk upon their Hands. Some tumble into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec570.txt')">Fame</a>, others grow immortal by
throwing themselves through a Hoop.</p><p>'CÃ¦tera de genere hoc adeo sunt multa, loquacem
Delassare valent Fabium--'</p><p>I am led into this Train of Thought by an Adventure I lately met with.</p><p>I was the other Day at a Tavern, where the Master of the <a name="topic47" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec570.txt')">House</a> [1]
accommodating us himself with every thing we wanted, I accidentally fell
into a Discourse with him; and talking of a certain great Man, who shall
be nameless, he told me, That he had sometimes the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec570.txt')">Honour</a> _to treat him
with a Whistle_; (adding by the way of Parenthesis) _For you must know,
Gentlemen, that I whistle the best of any Man in_ Europe. This naturally
put me upon desiring him to give us a Sample of his Art; upon which he
called for a Case-Knife, and applying the Edge of it to his Mouth,
converted it into a musical Instrument, and entertained me with an
_<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec570.txt')">Italian</a>_ Solo. Upon laying down the Knife, he took up a Pair of clean
Tobacco Pipes; and after having slid the small End of them over the
Table in a most melodious Trill, he fetched a Tune out of them,
whistling to them at the same time in Consort. In short, the
Tobacco-Pipes became _Musical Pipes_ in the Hands of our Virtuoso; who
confessed to me ingenuously, he had broke such Quantities of them, that
he had almost broke himself, before he had brought this Piece of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec570.txt')">Musick</a>
to any tolerable Perfection. I then told him I would bring a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec570.txt')">Company</a> of
Friends to dine with him the next Week, as an Encouragement to his
Ingenuity; upon which he thanked me, saying, That he would provide
himself with a new Frying-Pan against that Day. I replied, That it was
no matter; Roast and Boiled would serve our Turn. He smiled at my
Simplicity, and told me, That it was his Design to give us a Tune upon
it. As I was surprised at such a Promise, he sent for an old Frying-Pan,
and grating it upon the Board, whistled to it in such a melodious
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec570.txt')">Manner</a>, that you could scarce distinguish it from a Base-Viol. He then
took his Seat with us at the Table, and hearing my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec570.txt')">Friend</a> that was with
me humm over a Tune to himself, he told him if he would sing out he
would accompany his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('47', 'spec570.txt')">Voice</a> with a Tobacco-Pipe. As my Friend has an
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec570.txt')">agreeable</a> Base, he chose rather to sing to the Frying-Pan; and indeed
between them they made up a most extraordinary Consort. Finding our
Landlord so great a Proficient in Kitchen-Musick, I asked him if he was
Master of the Tongs and Key. He told Me that he had laid it down some
Years since, as a little unfashionable: but that if I pleased he would
give me a Lesson upon the Gridiron. He then informed me that he had
added two Bars to the Gridiron, in order to give it a greater Compass of
Sound; and I perceived was as well pleased with the Invention, as
_Sappho_ could have been upon adding two Strings to the Lute. To be
short, I found that his whole Kitchen was furnished with musical
Instruments; and could not but look upon this Artist as a kind of
Burlesque Musician.</p><p>He afterwards of his own Accord fell into the Imitation of several
Singing-Birds. My Friend and I toasted our Mistresses to the
Nightingale, when all of a sudden we were surpriz'd with the musick of
the Thrush. He next proceeded to the Sky-Lark, mounting up by a proper
Scale of Notes, and afterwards falling to the Ground with a very easy
and regular Descent. He then contracted his Whistle to the Voice of
several Birds of the smallest Size. As he is a Man of a larger Bulk and
higher Stature than ordinary, you would fancy him a Giant when you
look'd upon him, and a Tom Tit when you shut your Eyes. I must not omit
acquainting my Reader, that this accomplished Person was formerly the
Master of a Toy-shop near _Temple-Bar_; and that the famous _Charles
Mathers_ was bred up under him. I am told that the Misfortunes which he
has met with in the World, are chiefly owing to his great Application to
his Musick; and therefore cannot but recommend him to my Readers as one
who deserves their Favour, and may afford them great Diversion over a
Bottle of <a name="topic46" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('46', 'spec570.txt')">Wine</a>, which he sells at the Queen's Arms, near the End of the
little Piazza in _Covent-Garden_.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Named Daintry. He was of the trained bands, and commonly
known as Captain Daintry.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
