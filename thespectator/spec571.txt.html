<p>No. 571.                   Friday, July 23, 1714.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Coelum quid querimus ultra?'</p><p>Luc.</p><p></p><p>As the Work I have engaged in, will not only consist of Papers of Humour
and Learning, but of several Essays Moral and <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec571.txt')">Divine</a>, I shall publish
the following one, which is founded on a former SPECTATOR [1], and sent
me by a particular <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec571.txt')">Friend</a>, not questioning but it will please such of my
Readers, as think it no Disparagement to their Understandings to give
way sometimes to a serious Thought.</p><p>
SIR,</p><p>In your Paper of _Friday_ the 9th Instant, you had Occasion to
consider the Ubiquity of the Godhead, and at the same time, to shew,
that as he is present to every thing, he cannot but be attentive to
every thing, and privy to all the Modes and Parts of its Existence;
or, in other Words, that his Omniscience and Omnipresence are
coexistent, and run together through the whole Infinitude of Space.
This Consideration might furnish us with many Incentives to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec571.txt')">Devotion</a>
and Motives to Morality, but as this Subject has been handled by
several excellent Writers, I shall consider it in a Light wherein I
have not seen it placed by others.</p><p>_First_, How disconsolate is the Condition of an intellectual Being
who is thus present with his Maker, but at the same time receives no
extraordinary Benefit or Advantage from this his Presence!</p><p>_Secondly_, How deplorable is the Condition of an intellectual Being,
who feels no other Effects from this his Presence but such as proceed
from Divine Wrath and Indignation!</p><p>_Thirdly_, How happy is the Condition of that intellectual Being, who
is sensible of his Maker's Presence from the secret Effects of his
Mercy and Loving-kindness!</p><p>
_First_, How disconsolate is the Condition of an intellectual Being,
who is thus present with his Maker, but at the same time receives no
extraordinary Benefit or Advantage from this his Presence! Every
Particle of Matter is actuated by this Almighty Being which passes
through it. The Heavens and the Earth, the Stars and Planets, move and
gravitate by Vertue of this great Principle within them. All the dead
Parts of <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec571.txt')">Nature</a> are invigorated by the Presence of their Creator, and
made capable of exerting their respective Qualities. The several
Instincts, in the brute Creation, do likewise operate and work towards
the several Ends which are <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec571.txt')">agreeable</a> to them, by this Divine Energy.
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec571.txt')">Man</a> only, who does not co-operate with this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec571.txt')">holy</a> Spirit, and is
unattentive to his Presence, receives none of those Advantages from
it, which are perfective of his Nature, and necessary to his
Well-being. The Divinity is with him, and in him, and everywhere about
him, but of no Advantage to him. It is the same thing to a Man without
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec571.txt')">Religion</a>, as if there were no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec571.txt')">God</a> in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec571.txt')">World</a>. It is indeed
impossible for an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec571.txt')">infinite</a> Being to remove himself from any of his
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec571.txt')">Creatures</a>, but tho' he cannot withdraw his Essence from us, which
would argue an Imperfection in him, he can withdraw from us all the
Joys and Consolations of it. His Presence may perhaps be necessary to
support us in our Existence; but he may leave this our Existence to it
self, with regard to its Happiness or Misery. For, in this Sense, he
may cast us away from his Presence, and take his holy Spirit from us.
This single Consideration one would think sufficient to make us open
our Hearts to all those Infusions of Joy and Gladness which are so
near at Hand, and ready to be poured in upon us; especially when we
consider,</p><p>_Secondly_, The deplorable Condition of an intellectual Being who
feels no other Effects from his Maker's Presence, but such as proceed
from Divine Wrath and Indignation!</p><p>We may assure our selves, that the great Author of Nature will not
always be as one who is indifferent to any of his Creatures. Those who
will not feel him in his Love, will be sure at length to feel him in
his Displeasure. And how dreadful is the Condition of that Creature,
who is only sensible of the Being of his Creator by what he suffers
from him! He is as essentially present in Hell as in Heaven, but the
Inhabitants of those accursed Places behold him only in his Wrath, and
shrink within the Flames to conceal themselves from him. It is not in
the Power of Imagination to conceive the fearful Effects of
Omnipotence incensed.</p><p>But I shall only consider the Wretchedness of an intellectual Being,
who, in this Life, lies under the Displeasure of him, that at all
Times and in all Places is intimately united with him. He is able to
disquiet the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec571.txt')">Soul</a>, and vex it in all its Faculties. He can hinder any
of the greatest Comforts of Life from refreshing us, and give an Edge
to every one of its slightest Calamities. Who then can bear the
Thought of being an Out-cast from his Presence, that is, from the
Comforts of it, or of feeling it only in its Terrors? How pathetick is
that Expostulation of _Job_, when, for the Tryal of his Patience, he
was made to look upon himself in this deplorable Condition!</p><p>_Why hast thou set me as a Mark against thee, so that I am become a
Burthen to my self_?</p><p>But, _Thirdly_, how happy is the Condition of that intellectual Being,
who is sensible of his Maker's Presence from the secret Effects of his
Mercy and Loving-kindness.</p><p>The Blessed in Heaven behold him Face to Face; that is, are as
sensible of his Presence as we are of the Presence of any Person whom
we look upon with our Eyes. There is doubtless a Faculty in Spirits,
by which they apprehend one another, as our Senses do material
Objects; and there is no Question but our Souls, when they are
disembodied, or placed in glorified Bodies, will by this Faculty, in
whatever Part of Space they reside, be always sensible of the Divine
Presence. We, who have this Veil of Flesh standing between us and the
World of Spirits, must be Content to know that the Spirit of God is
present with us, by the Effects which he produces in us. Our outward
Senses are too gross to apprehend him; we may however taste and see
how gracious he is, by his Influence upon our Minds, by those Virtuous
Thoughts which he awakens in us, by those secret Comforts and
Refreshments which he conveys into our Souls, and by those ravishing
Joys and inward Satisfactions, which are perpetually springing up, and
diffusing themselves among all the Thoughts of good Men. He is lodged
in our very Essence, and is as a Soul within the Soul, to irradiate
its Understanding, rectifie its Will, purifie its Passions, and
enliven all the Powers of Man. How happy therefore is an intellectual
Being, who, by Prayer and Meditation, by Virtue and good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec571.txt')">Works</a>, opens
this Communication between God and his own Soul! Tho' the whole
Creation frowns upon him, and all Nature looks black about him, he has
his Light and Support within him, that are able to cheer his Mind, and
bear him up in the Midst of all those Horrors which encompass him. He
knows that his Helper is at Hand, and is always nearer to him than any
thing else can be, which is capable of annoying or terrifying him. In
the Midst of Calumny or Contempt, he attends to that Being who
whispers better things within his Soul, and whom he looks upon as his
Defender, his Glory, and the Lifter up of his Head. In his deepest
Solitude and Retirement, he knows that he is in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec571.txt')">Company</a> with the
greatest of Beings; and perceives within himself such real Sensations
of his Presence, as are more delightful than any thing that can be met
with in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec571.txt')">Conversation</a> of his Creatures. Even in the Hour of <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec571.txt')">Death</a>,
he considers the Pains of his Dissolution to be nothing else but the
breaking down of that Partition, which stands betwixt his Soul, and
the Sight of that Being, who is always present with him, and is about
to manifest it self to him in Fullness of Joy.</p><p>If we would be thus Happy, and thus Sensible of our Maker's Presence,
from the secret Effects of his Mercy and Goodness, we must keep such a
Watch over all our Thoughts, that, in the Language of the Scripture, his
Soul may have Pleasure in us. We must take care not to grieve his Holy
Spirit, and endeavour to make the Meditations of our Hearts always
acceptable in his Sight, that he may delight thus to reside and dwell in
us. The Light of Nature could direct _Seneca_ to this Doctrine, in a
very remarkable Passage among his Epistles:</p><p>_Sacer inest in nobis spiritus bonorum malorumque custos, et
Observator, et quemadmodum nos illum tractamus, ita et ille nos_
[2].</p><p>There is a Holy Spirit residing in us, who watches and observes both
Good and Evil Men, and will treat us after the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec571.txt')">Manner</a> that we
treat him. But I shall conclude this Discourse with those more
emphatical Words in Divine Revelation,</p><p>_If a Man love me, he will keep my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec571.txt')">Word</a>, and my Father will love
him, and we will come unto him, and make our Abode with him_ [3].</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: No. 565, and see Nos. 580, 590, and 628.]</p><p>
