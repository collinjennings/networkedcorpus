<p>No. 577.                  Friday, August 6, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Hoc tolerabile, si non
Et furere incipias--'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>The Letter mentioned in my last Paper is as follows.</p><p>
_SIR_,</p><p>'You have so lately decryed that Custom, too much in use among most
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec577.txt')">People</a>, of making themselves the Subjects of their Writings and
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec577.txt')">Conversation</a>, that I had some difficulty to perswade my self to give
you this Trouble, till I had considered that tho' I should <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec577.txt')">speak</a> in
the First Person, yet I could not be justly charged with Vanity, since
I shall not add my Name; as also, because what I shall write will not,
to say the best, redound to my Praise; but is only designed to remove
a Prejudice conceived against me, as I hope, with very little
Foundation. My short History is this.</p><p>I have lived for some Years last past altogether in _London_, till
about a Month ago an Acquaintance of mine, for whom I have done some
small Services in Town, invited me to pass part of the Summer with him
at his House in the Country. I accepted his Invitation, and found a
very hearty Welcome. My <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec577.txt')">Friend</a>, an honest plain Man, not being
qualified to pass away his Time without the Reliefs of Business, has
grafted the Farmer upon the Gentleman, and brought himself to submit
even to the servile Parts of that Employment, such as inspecting his
Plough, and the like. This necessarily takes up some of his Hours
every Day; and as I have no Relish for such Diversions, I used at
these Times to retire either to my Chamber, or a shady Walk near the
House, and entertain my self with some <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec577.txt')">agreeable</a> Author. Now you must
know, Mr. SPECTATOR, that when I read, especially if it be Poetry, it
is very usual with me, when I meet with any Passage or Expression
which strikes me much, to pronounce it aloud, with that Tone of the
Voice which I think agreeable to the Sentiments there expressed; and
to this I generally add some Motion or Action of the Body. It was not
long before I was observed by some of the Family in one of these
heroick Fits, who thereupon received Impressions very much to my
Disadvantage. This however I did not soon discover, nor should have
done probably, had it not been for the following Accident. I had one
Day shut my self up in my Chamber, and was very deeply engaged in the
Second Book of _Milton's Paradise Lost._ I walked to and fro with the
Book in my Hand, and, to speak the Truth, I fear I made no little
Noise; when presently coming to the following Lines,</p><p>'--On a sudden open fly,
With impetuous Recoil and jarring Sound,
Th' infernal Doors, and on their Hinges grate
Harsh Thunder, &c.'</p><p>'I in <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec577.txt')">great</a> Transport threw open the Door of my Chamber, and found the
greatest Part of the Family standing on the Out-side in a very great
Consternation. I was in no less Confusion, and begged Pardon for
having disturbed them; addressing my self particularly to comfort one
of the Children, who received an unlucky fall in this Action, whilst
he was too intently surveying my Meditations through the Key-hole. To
be short, after this Adventure I easily observed that great Part of
the Family, especially the Women and Children, looked upon me with
some Apprehensions of Fear; and my Friend himself, tho' he still
continued his Civilities to me, did not seem altogether easie: I took
Notice, that the Butler was never after this Accident ordered to leave
the Bottle upon the Table after Dinner. Add to this, that I frequently
overheard the Servants mention me by the Name of the crazed Gentleman,
the Gentleman a little touched, the mad _Londoner,_ and the like. This
made me think it high Time for me to shift my Quarters, which I
resolved to do the first handsome Opportunity; and was confirmed in
this Resolution by a young Lady in the Neighbourhood who frequently
visited us, and who one Day, after having heard all the fine <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec577.txt')">Things</a> I
was able to say, was pleased with a scornful Smile to bid me go to
sleep.</p><p>'The first Minute I got to my Lodgings in Town I set Pen to Paper to
desire your Opinion, whether, upon the Evidence before you, I am mad
or not. I can bring Certificates that I behave my self soberly before
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec577.txt')">Company</a>, and I hope there is at least some <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec577.txt')">Merit</a> in withdrawing to be
mad. Look you, Sir, I am contented to be esteemed a little touched, as
they phrase it, but should be sorry to be madder than my Neighbours;
therefore, pray let me be as much in my Senses as you can afford. I
know I could bring your self as an Instance of a Man who has confessed
talking to himself; but yours is a particular Case, and cannot justify
me, who have not kept Silence any Part of my Life. What if I should
own my self in Love? You know Lovers are always allowed the Comfort of
Soliloquy.--But I will say no more upon this Subject, because I have
long since observed, the ready Way to be thought Mad is to contend
that you are not so; as we generally conclude that Man drunk, who
takes Pains to be thought sober. I will therefore leave my self to
your Determination; but am the more desirous to be thought in my
Senses, that it may be no Discredit to you when I assure you that I
have always been very much</p><p>_Your Admirer._</p><p>P.S. _If I must be mad, I desire the young Lady may believe it is for
her.</p><p></p><p>The humble Petition of_ John a Nokes _and_ John a Stiles, _Sheweth,_</p><p>'That your Petitioners have had Causes depending in _Westminster-Hall_
above five hundred Years, and that we despair of ever seeing them
brought to an Issue: That your Petitioners have not been involved in
these Law Suits, out of any litigious Temper of their own, but by the
Instigation of contentious Persons; that the young Lawyers in our Inns
of Court are continually setting us together by the Ears, and think
they do us no Hurt, because they plead for us without a Fee; That many
of the Gentlemen of the Robe have no other Clients in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec577.txt')">World</a>
besides us two; That when they have nothing else to do, they make us
Plaintiffs and Defendants, tho' they were never retained by either of
us; That they traduce, condemn, or acquit us, without any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec577.txt')">manner</a> of
Regard to our Reputations and good Names in the World. Your
Petitioners therefore (being thereunto encouraged by the favourable
Reception which you lately gave to our Kinsman _Blank_) do humbly
pray, that you will put an End to the Controversies which have been so
long depending between us your said Petitioners, and that our Enmity
may not endure from Generation to Generation; it being our Resolution
to live hereafter as it becometh Men of peaceable Dispositions.</p><p>_And your Petitioners (as in Duty bound) shall ever Pray, &c._</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
