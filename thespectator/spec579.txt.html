<p>No. 579.                 Wednesday, August 11, 1714.            Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Odora canum vis--'</p><p>Virg.</p><p>
In the Reign of King _Charles_ I., the Company of Stationers, into whose
Hands the Printing of the Bible is committed by Patent, made a very
remarkable _Erratum_ or Blunder in one of their Editions: For instead of
_Thou shalt not commit Adultery_, they printed off several thousands of
Copies with _Thou shalt commit Adultery_. Archbishop _Laud_, to punish
this their Negligence, laid a considerable Fine upon that Company in the
_Star-Chamber_.</p><p>By the Practice of the World, which prevails in this degenerate Age, I
am afraid that very many <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec579.txt')">young</a> Profligates, of both Sexes, are possessed
of this spurious Edition of the Bible, and observe the Commandment
according to that faulty Reading.</p><p>Adulterers, in the first Ages of the <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec579.txt')">Church</a>, were excommunicated for
ever, and unqualified all their Lives from bearing a Part in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec579.txt')">Christian</a>
Assemblies, notwithstanding they might seek it with Tears, and all the
Appearances of the most unfeigned Repentance.</p><p>I might here mention some ancient Laws among the Heathens which punished
this Crime with Death: and others of the same Kind, which are now in
Force among several Governments that have embraced the Reformed
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec579.txt')">Religion</a>. But because a Subject of this Nature may be too serious for my
ordinary Readers, who are very apt to throw by my Papers, when they are
not enlivened with something that is diverting or uncommon; I shall here
publish the Contents of a little Manuscript lately fallen into my Hands,
and which pretends to great Antiquity, tho' by Reason of some modern
Phrases and other Particulars in it, I can by no means allow it to be
genuine, but rather the Production of a Modern Sophist.</p><p>It is well known by the Learned, that there was a Temple upon Mount
_Ã†tna_ dedicated to _Vulcan_, which was guarded by <a name="topic11" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('11', 'spec579.txt')">Dogs</a> of so exquisite
a Smell, (say the Historians) that they could discern whether the
Persons who came thither were chast or otherwise. They used to meet and
faun upon such as were chast, caressing them as the Friends of their
Master _Vulcan;_ but flew at those who were polluted, and never ceased
barking at them till they had driven them from the Temple.</p><p>My Manuscript gives the following Account of these Dogs, and was
probably designed as a Comment upon this Story.</p><p>
'These Dogs were given to Vulcan by his Sister Diana, the Goddess of
Hunting and of Chastity, having bred them out of some of her Hounds, in
which she had observed this natural Instinct and Sagacity. It was
thought she did it in Spight to _Venus,_ who, upon her Return home,
always found her Husband in a good or bad Humour, according to the
Reception which she met with from his Dogs. They lived in the Temple
several Years, but were such snappish Curs that they frighted away most
of the Votaries. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec579.txt')">Women</a> of _Sicily_ made a solemn Deputation to the
Priest, by which they acquainted him, that they would not come up to the
Temple with their annual Offerings unless he muzzled his Mastiffs; and
at last comprimised the Matter with him, that the Offering should always
be brought by a Chorus of young Girls, who were none of them above seven
Years old. It was wonderful (says the Author) to see how different the
Treatment was which the Dogs gave to these little Misses, from that
which they had shown to their Mothers. It is said that the Prince of
_Syracuse_, having married a young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec579.txt')">Lady</a>, and being naturally of a
jealous Temper, made such an Interest with the Priests of this Temple,
that he procured a Whelp from them of this famous Breed. The young Puppy
was very troublesome to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec579.txt')">fair</a> Lady at first, insomuch that she
sollicited her Husband to send him away, but the good Man cut her short
with the old _Sicilian_ Proverb, _Love me love my Dog_. From which Time
she lived very peaceably with both of them. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec579.txt')">Ladies</a> of _Syracuse_
were very much annoyed with him, and several of very good Reputation
refused to come to Court till he was discarded. There were indeed some
of them that defied his Sagacity, but it was observed, though he did not
actually bite them, he would growle at them most confoundedly. To return
to the Dogs of the Temple: After they had lived here in great Repute for
several Years, it so happened, that as one of the Priests, who had been
making a charitable Visit to a Widow who lived on the Promontory of
_Lilybeum_, return'd home <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec579.txt')">pretty</a> late in the Evening, the Dogs flew at
him with so much Fury, that they would have worried him if his Brethren
had not come in to his Assistance: Upon which, says my Author, the Dogs
were all of them hanged, as having lost their original Instinct.</p><p>I cannot conclude this Paper without wishing, that we had some of this
Breed of Dogs in _Great Britain_, which would certainly do _Justice_, I
should say _Honour_, to the Ladies of our Country, and shew the World
the difference between Pagan Women and those who are instructed in
sounder Principles of Virtue and Religion.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
