<p>No. 581.                Monday, August 16, 1714.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Sunt bona, sunt quædam mediocria, sunt mala plura
Quæ legis.'</p><p>Mart.</p><p></p><p>I am at present sitting with a Heap of Letters before me, which I have
received under the Character of SPECTATOR; I have Complaints from
Lovers, Schemes from Projectors, Scandal from Ladies, Congratulations,
Compliments, and Advice in abundance.</p><p>I have not been thus long an Author, to be insensible of the natural
Fondness every Person must have for their own Productions; and I begin
to think I have treated my Correspondents a little too uncivilly in
Stringing them all together on a File, and letting them lye so long
unregarded. I shall therefore, for the future, think my self at least
obliged to take some Notice of such Letters as I receive, and may
possibly do it at the end of every Month.</p><p>In the mean time, I intend my present Paper as a short Answer to most of
those which have been already sent me.</p><p>The Publick however is not to expect I should let them into all my
Secrets; and though I appear abstruse to most <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec581.txt')">People</a>, it is sufficient
if I am understood by my particular Correspondents.</p><p>My Well-wisher _Van Nath_ is very arch, but not quite enough so to
appear in Print.</p><p>_Philadelphus_ will, in a little time, see his Query fully answered by a
Treatise which is now in the Press.</p><p>It was very improper at that time to comply with Mr. _G_.</p><p>Miss _Kitty_ must excuse me.</p><p>The Gentleman who sent me a Copy of Verses on his Mistress's Dancing, is
I believe too thoroughly in Love to compose correctly.</p><p>I have too great a Respect for both the Universities to praise one at
the Expence of the other.</p><p>_Tom Nimble_ is a very honest Fellow, and I desire him to present my
humble Service to his Cousin _Fill Bumper_.</p><p>I am obliged for the Letter upon Prejudice.</p><p>I may in due time animadvert on the Case of _Grace Grumble_.</p><p>The Petition of _P. S. granted_.</p><p>That of _Sarah Loveit, refused_.</p><p>The Papers of _A. S._ are returned.</p><p>I thank _Aristippus_ for his kind Invitation.</p><p>My <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec581.txt')">Friend</a> at _Woodstock_ is a bold Man, to undertake for all within Ten
Miles of him.</p><p>I am afraid the Entertainment of _Tom Turnover_ will hardly be relished
by the good Cities of _London_ and _Westminster_.</p><p>I must consider further of it, before I indulge _W. F._ in those
Freedoms he takes with the Ladies Stockings.</p><p>I am obliged to the ingenious Gentleman, who sent me an Ode on the
Subject of a late SPECTATOR, and shall take particular Notice of his
last Letter.</p><p>When the Lady who wrote me a Letter, dated _July_ the 20th, in relation
to some Passages in a _Lover_, will be more particular in her
Directions, I shall be so in my Answer.</p><p>The poor Gentleman, who fancies my Writings could reclaim an Husband who
can abuse such a Wife as he describes, has I am afraid too great an
Opinion of my Skill.</p><p>_Philanthropos_ is, I dare say, a very well-meaning Man, but a little
too prolix in his Compositions.</p><p>_Constantius_ himself must be the best Judge in the Affair he mentions.</p><p>The Letter dated from _Lincoln_ is received.</p><p>_Arethusa_ and her Friend may hear further from me.</p><p>_Celia_ is a little too hasty.</p><p>_Harriot_ is a good Girl, but must not Curtsie to Folks she does not
know.</p><p>I must ingeniously confess my Friend _Sampson Bentstaff_ has quite
puzzled me, and writ me a long Letter which I cannot comprehend one <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec581.txt')">Word</a>
of.</p><p>_Collidan_ must also explain what he means by his _Drigelling_.</p><p>I think it beneath my _Spectatorial_ Dignity, to concern my self in the
Affair of the boiled Dumpling.</p><p>I shall consult some _Litterati_ on the Project sent me for the
Discovery of the Longitude.</p><p>I know not how to conclude this Paper better, than by inserting a Couple
of Letters which are really genuine, and which I look upon to be two of
the smartest Pieces I have received from my Correspondents of either Sex.</p><p>
_Brother_ SPEC.</p><p>'While you are surveying every Object that falls in your way, I am
wholly taken up with one. Had that Sage, who demanded what Beauty was,
lived to see the dear Angel I love, he would not have asked such a
Question. Had another seen her, he would himself have loved the Person
in whom Heaven has made Virtue visible; and were you your self to be
in her ompany, you could never, with all your Loquacity, say enough of
her good Humour and Sense. I send you the Outlines of a Picture, which
I can no more finish than I can sufficiently admire the dear Original.
I am</p><p>_Your most Affectionate Brother,_
Constantio Spec.</p><p>
_Good Mr._ Pert,</p><p>'I will allow you nothing till you resolve me the following Question.
Pray what's the Reason that while you only talk now upon _Wednesdays_,
_Fridays_, and _Mondays_, you pretend to be a greater Tatler, than
when you spoke every Day as you formerly used to do? If this be your
plunging out of your Taciturnity, pray let the Length of your Speeches
compensate for the Scarceness of them.</p><p>_I am_,
_Good Mr_. Pert,
_Your Admirer, if you will be long enough for Me_,
Amanda Lovelength.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
