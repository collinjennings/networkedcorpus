<p>No. 582.                Wednesday, August 18, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Tenet insanabile multos
Scribendi Cacoethes--'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>There is a certain <a name="topic28" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('28', 'spec582.txt')">Distemper</a>, which is mentioned neither by _Galen_ nor
_Hippocrates_, nor to be met with in the _London Dispensary_. _Juvenal_,
in the Motto of my Paper, terms it a _Cacoethes_; which is a hard Word
for a Disease called in plain _English_, the _Itch of <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec582.txt')">Writing</a>_. This
_Cacoethes_ is as Epidemical as the Small-Pox, there being very few who
are not seized with it some time or other in their Lives. There is,
however, this Difference in these two Distempers, that the first, after
having indisposed you for a time, never returns again; whereas this I am
speaking of, when it is once got into the Blood, seldom comes out of it.
The _British_ Nation is very much afflicted with this Malady, and tho'
very many Remedies have been applied to Persons infected with it, few of
them have ever proved successful. Some have been cauterized with Satyrs
and Lampoons, but have received little or no Benefit from them; others
have had their Heads fastned for an Hour together between a Cleft Board,
which is made use of as a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('28', 'spec582.txt')">Cure</a> for the Disease when it appears in its
greatest Malignity. [1] There is indeed one <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec582.txt')">kind</a> of this Malady which
has been sometimes removed, like the Biting of a _Tarantula_, with the
sound of a musical Instrument, which is commonly known by the Name of a
Cat-Call. But if you have a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('28', 'spec582.txt')">Patient</a> of this kind under your Care, you
may assure your self there is no other way of recovering him
effectually, but by forbidding him the use of Pen, Ink and Paper.</p><p>But to drop the Allegory before I have tired it out, there is no Species
of Scriblers more offensive, and more incurable, than your Periodical
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec582.txt')">Writers</a>, whose Works return upon the Publick on certain Days and at
stated Times. We have not the Consolation in the Perusal of these
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec582.txt')">Authors</a>, which we find at the reading of all others, (namely) that we
are sure if we have but Patience, we may come to the End of their
Labours. I have often admired a humorous Saying of _Diogenes_, who
reading a dull <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec582.txt')">Author</a> to several of his Friends, when every one began to
be tired, finding he was almost come to a blank leaf at the End of it,
cried, _Courage, Lads, I see Land_. On the contrary, our Progress
through that kind of Writers I am now speaking of is never at an End.
One Day makes Work for another, we do not know when to promise our
selves Rest.</p><p>It is a melancholy thing to consider, that the Art of Printing, which
might be the greatest Blessing to Mankind, should prove detrimental to
us, and that it should be made use of to scatter Prejudice and Ignorance
through a People, instead of conveying to them Truth and Knowledge.</p><p>I was lately reading a very whimsical Treatise, entitled, _William
Ramsey's_ Vindication of Astrology. This profound Author, among many
mystical Passages, has the following one:</p><p>'The Absence of the Sun is not the Cause of Night, forasmuch as his
Light is so great that it may illuminate the Earth all over at once as
clear as broad Day, but there are tenebrificous and dark Stars, by
whose Influence Night is brought on, and which do ray out Darkness and
Obscurity upon the Earth, as the Sun does Light.'</p><p>I consider Writers in the same View this sage Astrologer does the
Heavenly Bodies. Some of them are Stars that scatter Light as others do
Darkness. I could mention several Authors who are tenebrificous Stars of
the first Magnitude, and point out a Knot of Gentlemen, who have been
dull in Consort, and may be looked upon as a dark Constellation. The
Nation has been a great while benighted with several of these
Antiluminaries. I suffered them to ray out their Darkness as long as I
was able to endure it, till at length I came to a Resolution of rising
upon them, and hope in a little time to drive them quite out of the
_British_ Hemisphere.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Put in the Pillory.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
