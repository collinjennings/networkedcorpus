<p>No. 585.               Wednesday, August 25, 1714.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Ipsi lætitia voces ad sidera jactant
Intonsi montes: ipsæ jam carmina rupes,
Ipsæ sonant arbusta--'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>_The Sequel of the Story of_ Shalum _and_ Hilpa.</p><p>The Letter inserted in my last had so good an Effect upon _Hilpa,_ that
she answered it in less than a Twelvemonth, after the following <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec585.txt')">Manner</a>.</p><p>
Hilpa, _Mistress of the Vallies, to_ Shalum, _Master of Mount_ Tirzah.</p><p>_In the 789th Year of the Creation._</p><p>'What have I to do with thee, O _Shalum?_ Thou praisest _Hilpa_'s
Beauty, but <a name="topic21" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec585.txt')">art</a> thou not secretly enamoured with the Verdure of her
Meadows? Art thou not more affected with the Prospect of her <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec585.txt')">green</a>
Vallies, than thou wouldest be with the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec585.txt')">Sight</a> of her Person? The
Lowings of my Herds, and the Bleatings of my Flocks, make a pleasant
Eccho in thy Mountains, and sound sweetly in thy Ears. What tho' I am
delighted with the Wavings of thy Forests, and those Breezes of
Perfumes which flow from the Top of _Tirzah:_ Are these like the
Riches of the Valley?</p><p>'I know thee, O _Shalum;_ thou art more wise and happy than any of the
Sons of Men. Thy Dwellings are among the Cedars; thou searchest out
the Diversity of Soils, thou understandest the Influences of the
Stars, and markest the Change of Seasons. Can a Woman appear lovely in
the Eyes of such a one? Disquiet me not, O _Shalum;_ let me alone,
that I may enjoy those goodly Possessions which are fallen to my Lot.
Win me not by thy enticing Words. May thy <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec585.txt')">Trees</a> increase and multiply;
mayest thou add Wood to Wood, and Shade to Shade; but tempt not
_Hilpa_ to destroy thy Solitude, and make thy Retirement populous.</p><p>The _Chinese_ say, that a little time afterwards she accepted of a Treat
in one of the neighbouring Hills to which _Shalum_ had invited her. This
Treat lasted for two Years, and is said to have cost _Shalum_ five
hundred Antelopes, two thousand Ostriches, and a thousand Tun of Milk;
but what most of all recommended it, was that Variety of delicious
Fruits and Pot-herbs, in which no Person then living could any way equal
_Shalum_.</p><p>He treated her in the Bower which he had planted amidst the Wood of
Nightingales. This Wood was made up of such Fruit-Trees and Plants as
are most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec585.txt')">agreeable</a> to the several Kinds of Singing Birds; so that it had
drawn into it all the Musick of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec585.txt')">Country</a>, and was filled from one End
of the Year to the other with the most agreeable Consort in Season.</p><p>He shewed her every Day some <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec585.txt')">beautiful</a> and surprising Scene in this new
Region of Woodlands; and as by this Means he had all the Opportunities
he could wish for of opening his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('21', 'spec585.txt')">Mind</a> to her, he succeeded so well, that
upon her Departure she made him a kind of Promise, and gave him her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec585.txt')">Word</a>
to return him a positive Answer in less than fifty Years.</p><p>She had not been long among her own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec585.txt')">People</a> in the Vallies, when she
received new Overtures, and at the same Time a most splendid Visit from
_Mishpach_, who was a mighty Man of old, and had built a great City,
which he called after his own Name. Every House was made for at least a
thousand Years, nay there were some that were leased out for three
Lives; so that the Quantity of Stone and Timber consumed in this
Building is scarce to be imagined by those who live in the present Age
of the World. This great Man entertained her with the Voice of musical
Instruments which had been lately invented, and danced before her to the
Sound of the Timbrel. He also presented her with several domestick
Utensils wrought in Brass and Iron, which had been newly found out for
the Conveniency of Life. In the mean time _Shalum_ grew very uneasie
with himself, and was sorely displeased at _Hilpa_ for the Reception
which she had given to _Mishpach_, insomuch that he never wrote to her
or spoke of her during a whole Revolution of _Saturn_; but finding that
this Intercourse went no further than a Visit, he again renewed his
Addresses to her, who during his long Silence is said very often to have
cast a wishing Eye upon Mount _Tirzah_.</p><p>Her Mind continued wavering about twenty Years longer between _Shalum_
and _Mishpach_; for tho' her Inclinations favoured the former, her
Interest pleaded very powerfully for the other. While her Heart was in
this unsettled Condition, the following Accident happened which
determined her Choice. A high Tower of Wood that stood in the City of
_Mishpach_ having caught Fire by a Flash of Lightning, in a few Days
reduced the whole Town to Ashes. _Mishpach_ resolved to rebuild the
Place whatever it should cost him; and having already destroyed all the
Timber of the Country, he was forced to have Recourse to _Shalum_, whose
Forests were now two hundred Years old. He purchased these <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec585.txt')">Woods</a> with so
many Herds of Cattle and Flocks of Sheep, and with such a vast Extent of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec585.txt')">Fields</a> and Pastures, that _Shalum_ was now grown more wealthy than
_Mishpach_; and therefore appeared so charming in the Eyes of _Zilpah's_
Daughter, that she no longer refused him in Marriage. On the Day in
which he brought her up into the Mountains he raised a most prodigious
Pile of Cedar and of every <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec585.txt')">sweet</a> smelling Wood, which reached above 300
Cubits in Height; He also cast into the Pile Bundles of Myrrh and
Sheaves of Spikenard, enriching it with every spicy Shrub, and making it
fat with the Gums of his Plantations. This was the Burnt-Offering which
_Shalum_ offered in the Day of his Espousals: The Smoke of it ascended
up to Heaven, and filled the whole Country with Incense and Perfume.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
