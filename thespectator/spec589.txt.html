<p>No. 589.                  Friday, September 3, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'Persequitur scelus ille suum: labefactaque tandem
Ictibus innumeris adductaque funibus arbor
Corruit.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>'I am so great an Admirer of <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec589.txt')">Trees</a>, that the Spot of Ground I have
chosen to build a small Seat upon, in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec589.txt')">Country</a>, is almost in the
midst of a large Wood. I was obliged, much against my Will, to cut
down several Trees, that I might have any such thing as a Walk in my
Gardens; but then I have taken Care to leave the Space, between every
Walk, as much a Wood as I found it. The Moment you turn either to the
Right or Left, you are in a Forest, where Nature presents you with a
much more <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec589.txt')">beautiful</a> Scene than could have been raised by Art.</p><p>'Instead of _Tulips_ or _Carnations_, I can shew you _Oakes_ in my
Gardens of four hundred Years standing, and a Knot of _Elms_ that
might shelter a Troop of Horse from the Rain.</p><p>'It is not without the utmost Indignation, that I observe several
prodigal young Heirs in the Neighbourhood, felling down the most
glorious Monuments of their Ancestors Industry, and ruining, in a Day,
the Product of Ages.</p><p>'I am mightily pleased with your Discourse upon Planting, which put me
upon looking into my Books to give you some Account of the Veneration
the Ancients had for Trees. There is an old Tradition, that _Abraham_
planted a _Cypress_, a _Pine_, and a _Cedar_, and that these three
incorporated into one Tree, which was cut down for the building of the
Temple of _Solomon_.</p><p>'_Isidorus_, who lived in the Reign of _Constantius_, assures us, that
he saw, even in his Time, that famous _Oak_ in the Plains of _MambrÈ_,
under which _Abraham_ is reported to have dwelt, and adds, that the
People looked upon it with a great Veneration, and preserved it as a
Sacred Tree.</p><p>'The Heathens still went farther, and regarded it as the highest Piece
of Sacrilege to injure certain Trees which they took to be protected
by some Deity. The Story of _Erisicthon_, the Grove of _Dodona_, and
that at _Delphi_, are all Instances of this Kind.</p><p>'If we consider the Machine in _<a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec589.txt')">Virgil</a>_, so much blamed by several
Criticks, in this Light, we shall hardly think it too violent.</p><p>'_Æneas_, when he built his Fleet, in order to sail for _Italy_, was
obliged to cut down the Grove on Mount _Ida_, which however he durst
not do till he had obtained leave from _Cybele_, to whom it was
dedicated. The Goddess could not but think her self obliged to protect
these Ships, which were made of Consecrated Timber, after a very
extraordinary Manner, and therefore desired _Jupiter_, that they might
not be obnoxious to the Power of Waves or Winds. _Jupiter_ would not
grant this, but promised her, that as many as came safe to _Italy_
should be transformed into Goddesses of the Sea; which the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec589.txt')">Poet</a> tells
us was accordingly executed.</p><p>'And now at length the number'd Hours were come,
Prefix'd by Fate's irrevocable Doom,
When the great Mother of the Gods was free
To save her Ships, and finish_ Jove's _Decree.
First, from the Quarter of the Morn, there sprung
A Light that sign'd the Heavens, and shot along:
Then from a Cloud, fring'd <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec589.txt')">round</a> with Golden Fires,
Were Timbrels heard, and_ Berecynthian _Quires:
And last a Voice, with more than Mortal Sounds,
Both Hosts in Arms oppos'd, with equal Horror wounds.
O_ Trojan _Race, your needless Aid forbear;
And know my Ships are my peculiar Care.
With greater Ease the bold_ Rutulian _may,
With hissing Brands, attempt to burn the Sea,
Than singe my sacred Pines. But you my Charge,
Loos'd from your crooked Anchors launch at large,
Exalted each a Nymph: Forsake the Sand,
And swim the Seas, at_ Cybele's _Command.
No sooner had the Goddess ceas'd to speak,
When lo, th' obedient Ships their Haulsers break;
And, strange to tell, like Dolphins in the Main,
They plunge their Prows, and dive, and spring again:
As many beauteous Maids the Billows sweep,
As rode before tall Vessels on the Deep.'</p><p>Dryden's Virg.</p><p>'The common Opinion concerning the Nymphs, whom the Ancients called
_Hamadryads_, is more to the Honour of Trees than any thing yet
mentioned. It was thought the Fate of these Nymphs had so near a
Dependance on some Trees, more especially Oaks, that they lived and
died together. For this Reason they were extremely grateful to such
Persons who preserved those Trees with which their Being subsisted.
_Apollonius_ tells us a very remarkable Story to this Purpose, with
which I shall conclude my Letter.</p><p>'A certain Man, called _Rhoecus_, observing an old Oak ready to fall,
and being moved with a sort of Compassion towards the Tree, ordered
his Servants to pour in fresh Earth at the Roots of it, and set it
upright. The _Hamadryad_ or Nymph who must necessarily have perished
with the Tree, appeared to him the next Day, and after having returned
him her Thanks, told him, she was ready to grant whatever he should
ask. As she was extreamly Beautiful, _Rhoecus_ desired he might be
entertained as her Lover. The _Hamadryad_, not much displeased with
the Request, promis'd to give him a Meeting, but commanded him for
some Days to abstain from the Embraces of all other Women, adding that
she would send a Bee to him, to let him know when he was to be Happy.
_Rhoecus_ was, it seems, too much addicted to Gaming, and happened to
be in a Run of ill Luck when the faithful Bee came buzzing about him;
so that instead of minding his kind Invitation, he had like to have
killed him for his Pains. The _Hamadryad_ was so provoked at her own
Disappointment, and the ill Usage of her Messenger, that she deprived
_Rhoecus_ of the Use of his Limbs. However, says the Story, he was not
so much a Criple, but he made a shift to cut down the Tree, and
consequently to fell his Mistress.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
