<p>No. 590.               Monday, September 6, 1714.               Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Assiduo labuntur tempora motu
Non secus ac flumen. Neque enim consistere flumen,
Nec levis hora potest: sed ut unda, impellitur unda,
Urgeturque prior venienti, urgetque priorem,
Tempora sic fugiunt pariter, pariterque sequuntur;
Et nova sunt semper. Nam quod fuit ante, relictum est;
Fitque quod haud fuerat: momentaque cuncta novantur.'</p><p>Ov. Met.</p><p></p><p>_The following Discourse comes from the same Hand with the Essays upon
Infinitude_ [1].</p><p>
We consider <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec590.txt')">infinite</a> Space as an Expansion without a Circumference: We
consider Eternity, or infinite Duration, as a Line that has neither a
Beginning nor an End. In our Speculations of infinite Space, we consider
that particular Place in which we exist, as a <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec590.txt')">kind</a> of Center to the
whole Expansion. In our Speculations of Eternity, we consider the Time
which is present to us as the Middle, which divides the whole Line into
two equal Parts. For this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec590.txt')">Reason</a>, many witty <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec590.txt')">Authors</a> compare the present
Time to an Isthmus or narrow Neck of Land, that rises in the midst of an
Ocean, immeasurably diffused on either Side of it.</p><p>Philosophy, and indeed common Sense, naturally throws Eternity under two
Divisions; which we may call in _English_, that Eternity which is past,
and that Eternity which is to come. The learned Terms of _Æternitas a
Parte ante_, and _Æternitas a Parte post_, may be more amusing to the
Reader, but can have no other Idea affixed to them than what is conveyed
to us by those <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec590.txt')">Words</a>, an Eternity that is past, and an Eternity that is
to come. Each of these Eternities is bounded at the one Extream; or, in
other Words, the former has an End, and the latter a Beginning.</p><p>Let us first of all consider that Eternity which is past, reserving that
which is to come for the Subject of another Paper. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec590.txt')">Nature</a> of this
Eternity is utterly inconceivable by the Mind of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec590.txt')">Man</a>: Our Reason
demonstrates to us that it _has been_, but at the same Time can frame no
Idea of it, but what is big with Absurdity and Contradiction. We can
have no other Conception of any Duration which is past, than that all of
it was once present; and whatever was once present, is at some certain
Distance from us, and whatever is at any certain Distance from us, be
the Distance never so remote, cannot be Eternity. The very Notion of any
Duration's being past, implies that it was once present; for the Idea of
being once present, is actually included in the Idea of its being past.
This therefore is a Depth not to be sounded by <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec590.txt')">human</a> Understanding. We
are sure that there has been an Eternity, and yet contradict our selves
when we measure this Eternity by any Notion which we can frame of it.</p><p>If we go to the Bottom of this Matter, we shall find, that the
Difficulties we meet with in our Conceptions of Eternity proceed from
this single Reason, That we can have no other Idea of any kind of
Duration, than that by which we our selves, and all other created
Beings, do exist; which is, a successive Duration made up of past,
present, and to come. There is nothing which exists after this Manner,
all the Parts of whose Existence were not once actually present, and
consequently may be reached by a certain Number of Years applied to it.
We may ascend as high as we please, and employ our Being to that
Eternity which is to come, in adding Millions of Years to Millions of
Years, and we can never come up to any Fountain-Head of Duration, to any
Beginning in Eternity: But at the same time we are sure, that whatever
was once present does lye within the Reach of Numbers, though perhaps we
can never be able to put enough of them together for that Purpose. We
may as well say, that any thing may be actually present in any Part of
infinite Space, which does not lye at a certain Distance from us, as
that any Part of infinite Duration was once actually present, and does
not also lye at some determined Distance from us. The Distance in both
Cases may be immeasurable and indefinite as to our Faculties, but our
Reason tells us that it cannot be so in it self. Here therefore is that
Difficulty which Human Understanding is not capable of surmounting. We
are sure that something must have existed from Eternity, and are at the
same Time unable to conceive, that any thing which exists, according to
our Notion of Existence, can have existed from Eternity.</p><p>It is hard for a Reader, who has not rolled this Thought in his own
Mind, to follow in such an abstracted Speculation; but I have been the
longer on it, because I think it is a demonstrative Argument of the
Being and Eternity of a God: And tho' there are many other
Demonstrations which lead us to this great Truth, I do not think we
ought to lay aside any Proofs in this Matter which the Light of Reason
has suggested to us, especially when it is such a one as has been urged
by Men famous for their Penetration and Force of Understanding, and
which appears altogether conclusive to those who will be at the Pains to
examine it.</p><p>Having thus considered that Eternity which is past, according to the
best Idea we can frame of it, I shall now draw up those several Articles
on this Subject which are dictated to us by the Light of Reason, and
which may be looked upon as the Creed of a Philosopher in this great
Point.</p><p>_First_, It is certain that no Being could have made it self; for if so,
it must have acted before it was, which is a Contradiction.</p><p>_Secondly_, That therefore some Being must have existed from all
Eternity.</p><p>_Thirdly_, That whatever exists after the manner of created Beings, or
according to any Notions which we have of Existence, could not have
existed from Eternity.</p><p>_Fourthly_, That this eternal Being must therefore be the great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec590.txt')">Author</a>
of Nature, _The Ancient of Days_, who, being at an infinite Distance in
his Perfections from all finite and created Beings, exists in a quite
different Manner from them, and in a Manner of which they can have no
Idea.</p><p>I know that several of the School-men, who would not be thought ignorant
of any thing, have pretended to explain the Manner of God's Existence,
by telling us, That he comprehends infinite Duration in every Moment;
That Eternity is with him a _Punctum stans_, a fixed Point; or, which is
as good Sense, an _Infinite Instance_; That nothing with Reference to
his Existence is either past or to come: To which the ingenious Mr.
_Cowley_ alludes in his Description of Heaven,</p><p>'Nothing is there to come, and nothing past,
But an Eternal NOW does always last.'</p><p>For my own Part, I look upon these Propositions as Words that have no
Ideas annexed to them; and think Men had better own their Ignorance than
advance Doctrines by which they mean nothing, and which indeed are
self-contradictory. We cannot be too modest in our Disquisitions, when
we meditate on Him who is environed with so much Glory and Perfection,
who is the Source of Being, the Fountain of all that Existence which we
and his whole Creation derive from him. Let us therefore with the utmost
Humility acknowledge, that as some Being must necessarily have existed
from Eternity, so this Being does exist after an incomprehensible
manner, since it is impossible for a Being to have existed from Eternity
after our Manner or Notions of Existence. Revelation confirms these
natural Dictates of Reason in the Accounts which it gives us of the
Divine Existence, where it tells us, that he is the same Yesterday,
To-day, and for Ever; that he is the _Alpha_ and _Omega_, the Beginning
and the Ending; that a thousand Years are with him as one Day, and one
Day as a Thousand Years; by which and the like Expressions, we are
taught, that his Existence, with Relation to Time or Duration, is
infinitely different from the Existence of any of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec590.txt')">Creatures</a>, and
consequently that it is impossible for us to frame any adequate
Conceptions of it.</p><p>In the first Revelation which he makes of his own Being, he entitles
himself, _I am that I am_; and when _Moses_ desires to know what Name he
shall give him in his Embassy to _Pharaoh_, he bids him say that _I am_
hath sent you. Our great Creator, by this Revelation of himself, does in
a manner exclude every thing else from a real Existence, and
distinguishes himself from his Creatures, as the only Being which truly
and really exists. The ancient Platonick Notion, which was drawn from
Speculations of Eternity, wonderfully agrees with this Revelation which
God has made of himself. There is nothing, say they, which in Reality
exists, whose Existence, as we call it, is pieced up of past, present,
and to come. Such a flitting and successive Existence is rather a Shadow
of Existence, and something which is like it, than Existence it self. He
only properly exists whose Existence is intirely present; that is, in
other Words, who exists in the most perfect Manner, and in such a Manner
as we have no Idea of.</p><p>I shall conclude this Speculation with one useful Inference. How can we
sufficiently prostrate our selves and fall down before our Maker, when
we consider that ineffable Goodness and Wisdom which contrived this
Existence for finite Natures? What must be the Overflowings of that good
Will, which prompted our Creator to adapt Existence to Beings, in whom
it is not necessary? Especially when we consider that he himself was
before him in the compleat Possession of Existence and of Happiness, and
in the full Enjoyment of Eternity. What Man can think of himself as
called out and separated from nothing, of his being made a conscious, a
reasonable and a happy Creature, in short, of being taken in as a Sharer
of Existence, and a kind of Partner in Eternity, without being swallowed
up in Wonder, in Praise, in Adoration! It is indeed a Thought too big
for the Mind of Man, and rather to be entertained in the Secrecy of
Devotion, and in the Silence of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec590.txt')">Soul</a>, than to be expressed by Words.
The Supreme Being has not given us Powers or Faculties sufficient to
extol and magnifie such unutterable Goodness.</p><p>It is however some Comfort to us, that we shall be always doing what we
shall be never able to do, and that a Work which cannot be finished,
will however be the Work of an Eternity.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: See Nos. 565, 571, 580, and 628.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
