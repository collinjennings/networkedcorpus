<p>No. 592.             Friday, September 10, 1714.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'--Studium sine divite Vena--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I look upon the <a name="topic42" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec592.txt')">Play</a>-house as a <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec592.txt')">World</a> within it self. They have lately
furnished the Middle Region of it with a new Sett of Meteors, in order
to give the Sublime to many modern Tragedies. I was there last Winter at
the first Rehearsal of the new Thunder [1], which is much more deep and
sonorous than any hitherto made use of. They have a _Salmoneus_ behind
the Scenes, who plays it off with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec592.txt')">great</a> Success. Their Lightnings are
made to flash more briskly than heretofore; their Clouds are also better
furbelow'd, and more voluminous; not to mention a violent Storm locked
up in a great Chest that is designed for the _Tempest_. They are also
provided with above a Dozen Showers of Snow, which, as I am informed,
are the Plays of many unsuccessful Poets artificially cut and shreaded
for that Use. Mr. _Rimer's Edgar_ is to fall in Snow at the next acting
of King _Lear_, in order to heighten, or rather to alleviate, the
Distress of that unfortunate Prince; and to serve by way of Decoration
to a Piece which that great Critick has written against.</p><p>I do not indeed wonder that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec592.txt')">Actors</a> should be such professed Enemies
to those among our Nation who are commonly known by the Name of
Criticks, since it is a Rule among these Gentlemen to fall upon a Play,
not because it is ill written, but because it takes. Several of them lay
it down as a Maxim, That whatever Dramatick Performance has a long Run,
must of Necessity be good for nothing; as though the first Precept in
<a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec592.txt')">Poetry</a> were _not to please_. Whether this Rule holds good or not, I
shall leave to the Determination of those who are better Judges than my
self: If it does, I am sure it tends very much to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec592.txt')">Honour</a> of those
Gentlemen who have established it; few of their Pieces having been
disgraced by a Run of three Days, and most of them being so exquisitely
written, that the Town would never give them more than one Night's
Hearing.</p><p>I have a great Esteem for a true Critick, such as _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec592.txt')">Aristotle</a>_ and
_Longinus_ among the _Greeks_, _Horace_ and _Quintilian_ among the
_Romans_, _Boileau_ and _Dacier_ among the _French_. But it is our
Misfortune, that some who set up for professed Criticks among us are so
stupid, that they do not know how to put ten <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec592.txt')">Words</a> together with
Elegance or common Propriety, and withal so illiterate, that they have
no Taste of the learned Languages, and therefore criticise upon old
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec592.txt')">Authors</a> only at second-hand. They judge of them by what others have
written, and not by any Notions they have of the Authors themselves. The
Words Unity, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec592.txt')">Action</a>, Sentiment, and Diction, pronounced with an Air of
Authority, give them a Figure among unlearned Readers, who are apt to
believe they are very deep, because they are unintelligible. The Ancient
Criticks are full of the Praises of their Contemporaries; they discover
Beauties which escaped the Observation of the Vulgar, and very often
find out Reasons for palliating and excusing such little Slips and
Oversights as were committed in the Writings of eminent Authors. On the
contrary, most of the Smatterers in Criticism who appear among us, make
it their Business to vilifie and depreciate every new Production that
gains Applause, to descry imaginary Blemishes, and to prove by
far-fetch'd Arguments, that what pass for Beauties in any celebrated
Piece are Faults and Errors. In short, the Writings of these Criticks
compared with those of the Ancients, are like the Works of the Sophists
compared with those of the old Philosophers.</p><p>Envy and Cavil are the natural Fruits of Laziness and Ignorance; which
was probably the Reason, that in the Heathen Mythology _Momus_ is said
to be the Son of _Nox_ and _Somnus_, of Darkness and Sleep. Idle Men,
who have not been at the Pains to accomplish or distinguish themselves,
are very apt to detract from others; as ignorant Men are very subject to
decry those Beauties in a celebrated Work which they have not Eyes to
discover. Many of our Sons of _Momus_, who dignify themselves by the
Name of Criticks, are the genuine Descendants of these two illustrious
Ancestors. They are often led into those numerous Absurdities, in which
they daily instruct the People, by not considering that, _1st_, There is
sometimes a greater Judgment shewn in deviating from the Rules of Art,
than in adhering to them; and, _2dly_, That there is more Beauty in the
Works of a great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec592.txt')">Genius</a> who is ignorant of all the Rules of Art, than in
the Works of a little Genius, who not only knows, but scrupulously
observes them.</p><p>First, We may often take Notice of Men who are perfectly acquainted with
all the Rules of good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec592.txt')">Writing</a>, and notwithstanding chuse to depart from
them on extraordinary Occasions. I could give Instances out of all the
Tragick <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec592.txt')">Writers</a> of Antiquity who have shewn their Judgment in this
Particular; and purposely receded from an established Rule of the Drama,
when it has made way for a much higher Beauty than the Observation of
such a Rule would have been. Those who have surveyed the noblest Pieces
of Architecture and Statuary both ancient and modern, know very well
that there are frequent Deviations from Art in the Works of the greatest
Masters, which have produced a much nobler Effect than a more accurate
and exact way of Proceeding could have done. This often arises from what
the _Italians_ call the _Gusto Grande_ in these Arts, which is what we
call the Sublime in Writing.</p><p>In the next Place, our Criticks do not seem sensible that there is more
Beauty in the Works of a great Genius who is ignorant of the Rules of
Art, than in those of a little Genius who knows and observes them. It is
of these Men of Genius that _Terence_ speaks, in Opposition to the
little artificial Cavillers of his Time;</p><p>'Quorum æmulari exoptat negligentiam
Potiùs, quàm istorum obscuram diligentiam.'</p><p>A Critick may have the same Consolation in the ill Success of his Play,
as Dr. _South_ tells us a Physician has at the Death of a Patient, That
he was killed _secundum artem_. Our inimitable _Shakespear_ is a
Stumbling-Block to the whole Tribe of these rigid Criticks. Who would
not rather read one of his Plays, where there is not a single Rule of
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('42', 'spec592.txt')">Stage</a> observed, than any Production of a modern Critick, where there
is not one of them violated? _Shakespear_ was indeed born with all the
Seeds of Poetry, and may be compared to the Stone in _Pyrrhus's_ Ring,
which, as _Pliny_ tells us, had the Figure of _Apollo_ and the Nine
Muses in the Veins of it, produced by the spontaneous Hand of Nature,
without any Help from Art.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: John Dennis's invention, of which he said with exultation,
