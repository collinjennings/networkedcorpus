<p>No. 593.                Monday, September 13, 1714.             Byrom.</p><p></p><p>'Quale per incertam Lunam sub luce maligna
Est iter in Sylvis:--'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>My dreaming Correspondent, Mr. _Shadow_, has sent me a second Letter,
with several curious Observations on <a name="topic45" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec593.txt')">Dreams</a> in general, and the Method
to render <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec593.txt')">Sleep</a> improving: An Extract of his Letter will not, I presume,
be disagreeable to my Readers.</p><p>
'Since we have so little Time to spare, that none of it may be lost, I
see no Reason why we should neglect to examine those imaginary Scenes
we are presented with in Sleep, only because they have less Reality in
them than our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec593.txt')">waking</a> Meditations. A Traveller would bring his Judgment
in Question who should despise the Directions of his Map for want of
real Roads in it, because here stands a _Dott_ instead of a Town, or a
_Cypher_ instead of a City, and it must be a long Day's Journey to
travel thro' two or three Inches. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec593.txt')">Fancy</a> in Dreams gives us much such
another Landskip of Life as that does of Countries, and tho' its
Appearances may seem strangely jumbled together, we may often observe
such Traces and Footsteps of noble Thoughts, as, if carefully pursued,
might lead us into a proper Path of <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec593.txt')">Action</a>. There is so much Rapture
and Extasie in our fancied Bliss, and something so dismal and shocking
in our fancied Misery, that tho' the Inactivity of the Body has given
Occasion for calling Sleep the Image of _Death_, the Briskness of the
Fancy affords us a strong Intimation of something within us that can
never die.</p><p>'I have wondered, that _Alexander_ the Great, who came into the World
sufficiently dreamt of by his Parents, and had himself a tolerable
Knack at dreaming, should often say, that</p><p>
'Sleep was one thing which made him sensible he was Mortal.'</p><p>I who have not such <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec593.txt')">Fields</a> of Action in the Daytime to divert my
Attention from this Matter, plainly perceive, that in those Operations
of the Mind, while the Body is at rest, there is a certain Vastness of
Conception very suitable to the Capacity, and demonstrative of the
Force of that Divine Part in our Composition which will last for ever.
Neither do I much doubt but had we a true Account of the Wonders the
Hero last mentioned performed in his Sleep, his conquering this little
Globe would hardly be worth mentioning. I may affirm, without Vanity,
that when I compare several <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec593.txt')">Actions</a> in _Quintus Curtius_ with some
others in my own Noctuary, I appear the greater Hero of the two.</p><p>I shall close this Subject with observing, that while we are <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec593.txt')">awake</a> we
are at Liberty to fix our Thoughts on what we please, but in Sleep we
have not the Command of them. The Ideas which strike the Fancy, arise
in us without our Choice, either from the Occurrences of the Day past,
the Temper we lye down in, or it may be the Direction of some superior
Being.</p><p>It is certain the Imagination may be so differently affected in Sleep,
that our Actions of the Day might be either rewarded or punished with
a little Age of Happiness or Misery. St. _Austin_ was of Opinion, that
if in _Paradise_ there was the same Vicissitude of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec593.txt')">sleeping</a> and waking
as in the present World, the Dreams of its Inhabitants would be very
happy.</p><p>And so far at present our Dreams are in our Power, that they are
generally conformable to our waking Thoughts, so that it is not
impossible to convey our selves to a Consort of Musick, the
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec593.txt')">Conversation</a> of Distant Friends, or any other Entertainment which has
been before lodged in the Mind.</p><p>My Readers, by applying these Hints will find the Necessity of making
a _good Day_ of it, if they heartily wish themselves a good Night.</p><p>I have often consider'd _Marcia's_ Prayer, and _Lucius's_ Account of
_Cato_, in this Light.</p><p>
Marc.   O ye immortal Powers, that guard the Just,
Watch <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec593.txt')">round</a> his Couch, and soften his Repose,
Banish his Sorrows, and becalm his Soul
With easie Dreams; remember all his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec593.txt')">Virtues</a>;
And shew Mankind that Goodness is your Care.</p><p>Luc.    <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec593.txt')">Sweet</a> are the Slumbers of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec593.txt')">virtuous</a> Man!
O Marcia, I have seen thy Godlike Father:
Some Pow'r invisible supports his Soul,
And bears it up in all its wonted Greatness.
A kind refreshing Sleep is fall'n upon him:
I saw him stretcht at Ease, his Fancy lost
In pleasing Dreams; as I drew near his Couch,
He smil'd, and cry'd, CÃ¦sar, thou canst not hurt me.</p><p>
Mr. _Shadow_ acquaints me in a Postscript, that he has no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec593.txt')">manner</a> of
Title to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec593.txt')">Vision</a> which succeeded his first Letter; but adds, that as
the Gentleman who wrote it Dreams very sensibly, he shall be glad to
meet him some Night or other, under the great Elm Tree, by which
_Virgil_ has given us a fine Metaphorical Image of Sleep, in order to
turn over a few of the Leaves together, and oblige the Publick with an
Account of the Dreams that lie under them.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
