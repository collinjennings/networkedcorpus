<p>No. 594.                 Wednesday, September 15, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Absentem qui rodit amicum,
Qui non defendit, alio culpante; solutos
Qui captat risus hominum, famamque dicacis,
Fingere qui non visa potest, commissa tacere
Qui nequit, hic niger est: hunc tu Romane caveto.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Were all the Vexations of Life put together, we should find that a great
Part of them proceed from those Calumnies and Reproaches which we spread
abroad concerning one another.</p><p>There is scarce a Man living who is not, in some Degree, <a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec594.txt')">guilty</a> of this
Offence; tho', at the same time, however we treat one another, it must
be confessed, that we all consent in speaking <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec594.txt')">ill</a> of the Persons who are
notorious for this Practice. It generally takes its Rise either from an
Ill-will to Mankind, a private Inclination to make our selves esteemed,
an Ostentation of Wit, a Vanity of being thought in the Secrets of the
World, or from a Desire of gratifying any of these Dispositions of Mind
in those Persons with whom we converse.</p><p>The Publisher of Scandal is more or less odious to Mankind, and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec594.txt')">criminal</a>
in himself, as he is influenced by any one or more of the foregoing
Motives. But whatever may be the Occasion of spreading these false
Reports, he ought to consider, that the Effect of them is equally
prejudicial and pernicious to the Person at whom they are aimed. The
Injury is the same, tho' the Principle from whence it proceeds may be
different.</p><p>As every one looks upon himself with too much Indulgence, when he passes
a Judgment on his own Thoughts or <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec594.txt')">Actions</a>, and as very few would be
thought guilty of this abominable Proceeding, which is so universally
practised, and, at the same time, so universally blamed, I shall lay
down three Rules by which I would have a Man examine and search into his
own Heart, before he stands acquitted to himself of that evil
Disposition of Mind which I am here mentioning.</p><p>_First_ of all, Let him consider whether he does not take Delight in
hearing the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec594.txt')">Faults</a> of others.</p><p>_Secondly_, Whether he is not too apt to believe such little blackning
Accounts, and more inclined to be credulous on the uncharitable than
on the good-natured Side.</p><p>_Thirdly_, Whether he is not ready to spread and propagate such
Reports as tend to the Disreputation of another. These are the several
Steps by which this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec594.txt')">Vice</a> proceeds, and grows up into Slander and
Defamation.</p><p>In the first Place, A Man who takes delight in hearing the Faults of
others, shows sufficiently that he has a true Relish of Scandal, and
consequently the Seeds of this Vice within him. If his mind is gratified
with hearing the Reproaches [which [1]] are cast on others, he will find
the same Pleasure in relating them, and be the more apt to do it, as he
will naturally imagine every one he converses with is delighted in the
same <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec594.txt')">manner</a> with himself. A Man should endeavour therefore to wear out
of his Mind this criminal Curiosity, which is perpetually heightened and
inflamed by listening to such Stories as tend to the Disreputation of
others.</p><p>In the second Place, a Man should consult his own Heart, whether he be
not apt to _believe_ such little blackening Accounts, and more enclined
to be credulous on the uncharitable, than on the good-natured Side.</p><p>Such a Credulity is very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec594.txt')">vicious</a> in it self, and generally arises from a
Man's Consciousness of his own <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec594.txt')">secret</a> Corruptions. It is a pretty Saying
of _Thales_, Falshood is just as far distant from Truth, as the Ears are
from the Eyes. [2] By which he would intimate, that a wise Man should
not easily give Credit to the Reports of Actions which he has not seen.
I shall, under this Head, mention two or three remarkable Rules to be
observed by the Members of the celebrated Abbey _de la Trape_, as they
are Published in a little _French_ Book. [3]</p><p>The Fathers are there ordered, never to give an Ear to any Accounts of
Base or Criminal Actions; to turn off all such Discourse if possible;
but in Case they hear any thing of this Nature so well attested that
they cannot disbelieve it, they are then to suppose, that the criminal
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec594.txt')">Action</a> may have proceeded from a good Intention in him who is guilty of
it. This is perhaps carrying Charity to an Extravagance, but it is
certainly much more Laudable, than to suppose, as the ill-natured part
of the World does, that indifferent, and even Good Actions, proceed from
bad Principles and wrong Intentions.</p><p>In the third Place, a Man should examine his Heart, whether he does not
find in it a secret Inclination to propagate such Reports, as tend to
the Disreputation of another.</p><p>When the Disease of the Mind, which I have hitherto been speaking of,
arises to this Degree of Malignity it discovers its self in its worst
Symptoms, and is in danger of becoming incurable. I need not therefore
insist upon the Guilt in this last Particular, which every one cannot
but disapprove, who is not void of Humanity, or even common Discretion.
I shall only add, that whatever Pleasure any Man may take in spreading
Whispers of this Nature, he will find an infinitely greater Satisfaction
in conquering the Temptation he is under, by letting the Secret die
within his own Breast.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: [that]]</p><p>
