<p>No. 595.                 Friday, September 17, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Non ut placidis coeant immitia, non ut
Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus agni--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>If ordinary <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec595.txt')">Authors</a> would condescend to write as they think, they would
at least be allow'd the Praise of being intelligible. But they really
take Pains to be ridiculous; and, by the studied Ornaments of Style,
perfectly disguise the little Sense they aim at. There is a Grievance of
this Sort in the Common-wealth of Letters, which I have for some time
resolved to redress, and accordingly I have set this Day apart for
Justice. What I mean is, the _Mixture of inconsistent Metaphors_, which
is a Fault but too often found in learned <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec595.txt')">Writers</a>, but in all the
unlearned without Exception.</p><p>In order to set this Matter in a clear Light to every Reader, I shall in
the first Place observe, that a Metaphor is a Simile in one <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec595.txt')">Word</a>, which
serves to convey the Thoughts of the Mind under Resemblances and Images
which affect the Senses. There is not any thing in the World, which may
not be compared to several Things, if considered in several distinct
Lights; or, in other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec595.txt')">Words</a>, the same thing may be expressed by different
Metaphors. But the Mischief is, that an unskilful <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec595.txt')">Author</a> shall run these
Metaphors so absurdly into one another, that there shall be no Simile,
no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec595.txt')">agreeable</a> Picture, no apt Resemblance, but Confusion, Obscurity, and
Noise. Thus I have known a Hero compared to a Thunderbolt, a Lion, and
the Sea; all and each of them proper Metaphors for impetuosity, Courage
or Force. But by bad Management it hath so happened, that the
Thunder-bolt hath overflowed its Banks; the Lion hath been darted
through the Skies, and the Billows have rolled out of the _Libyan_
Desart.</p><p>The Absurdity in this Instance is obvious. And yet every time that
clashing Metaphors are put together, this Fault is committed more or
less. It hath already been said, that Metaphors are Images of things
which affect the Senses. An Image therefore, taken from what acts upon
the Sight, cannot, without Violence, be applied to the Hearing; and so
of the rest. It is no less an impropriety to make any Being in Nature or
Art to do things in its Metaphorical State, which it could not do in its
Original. I shall illustrate what I have said by an Instance which I
have read more than once in Controversial Writers. _The heavy Lashes_,
saith a celebrated Author, _that have dropped from your Pen_, &c. I
suppose this Gentleman having frequently heard of _Gall dropping from a
Pen_, and _being lashed in a Satyr_, he was resolved to have them both
at any Rate, and so uttered this compleat Piece of Nonsense. It will
most effectually discover the Absurdity of these monstrous Unions, if we
will suppose these Metaphors or Images actually Painted. Imagine then a
Hand holding a Pen, and several Lashes of Whip-cord falling from it, and
you have the true Representation of this sort of Eloquence. I believe,
by this very Rule, a Reader may be able to judge of the Union of all
Metaphors whatsoever, and determine which are Homogeneous and which
Heterogeneous: or to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec595.txt')">speak</a> more plainly, which are Consistent, and which
Inconsistent.</p><p>There is yet one Evil more which I must take notice of, and that is the
running of Metaphors into tedious Allegories; which, though an Error on
the better Hand, causes Confusion as much as the other. This becomes
abominable, when the Lustre of one Word leads a Writer out of his Road,
and makes him wander from his Subject for a Page together. I remember a
young Fellow, of this Turn, who having said by Chance that his Mistress
had a _World_ of Charms, thereupon took Occasion to consider her as one
possessed of Frigid and Torrid Zones, and pursued her from the one Pole
to the other. I shall conclude this Paper with a Letter written in that
enormous Style, which I hope my Reader hath by this time set his Heart
against. The Epistle hath heretofore received great Applause; but after
what hath been said, let any Man commend it if he dare.</p><p>
_SIR,_</p><p>'After the many heavy _Lashes_ that have fallen from your _Pen_, you
may justly expect in return all the _Load_ that my _Ink_ can lay upon
your Shoulders. You have _Quartered_ all the foul _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec595.txt')">Language</a>_ upon me,
that could be _raked_ out of the Air of _Billingsgate_, without
knowing who I am, or whether I deserved to be _Cupped_ and _Scarified_
at this rate. I tell you once for all, turn your _Eyes_ where you
please, you shall never _Smell_ me out. Do you think that the
_Panicks_, which you _sow_ about the Parish, will ever _build_ a
Monument to your Glory? No, Sir, you may _Fight_ these Battles as long
as you will, but when you come to _Ballance_ the Account you will find
that you have been _Fishing_ in troubled Waters, and that an _Ignis
fatuus_ hath bewildered you, and that indeed you have _built_ upon a
sandy Foundation, and brought your _Hogs_ to a fair Market.</p><p>_I am, SIR,</p><p>Yours, &c._</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
