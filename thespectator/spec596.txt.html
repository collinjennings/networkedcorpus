<p>No. 596.                 Monday, September 20, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'Molle meum levibus Cor est violabile Telis.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>The Case of my Correspondent who sends me the following Letter has
somewhat in it so very whimsical, that I know not how to entertain my
Readers better than by laying it before them.</p><p>
_SIR,_</p><p>'I am fully convinced that there is not upon Earth a more impertinent
Creature than an importunate <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec596.txt')">Lover</a>: We are daily complaining of the
Severity of our Fate, to <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec596.txt')">People</a> who are wholly unconcerned in it; and
hourly improving a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec596.txt')">Passion</a>, which we would persuade the World is the
Torment of our Lives. Notwithstanding this Reflection, Sir, I cannot
forbear acquainting you with my own Case. You must know then, Sir,
that even from my Childhood, the most prevailing Inclination I could
perceive in my self, was a strong Desire to be in Favour with the <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec596.txt')">Fair</a>
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec596.txt')">Sex</a>. I am at present in the one and twentieth Year of my Age, and
should have made Choice of a She Bed-fellow many Years since, had not
my Father, who has a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec596.txt')">pretty</a> good Estate of his own getting, and passes
in the World for a prudent Man, being pleased to lay it down as a
Maxim, That nothing spoils a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec596.txt')">young</a> Fellow's Fortune so much as
marrying early; and that no Man ought to think of Wedlock 'till six
and twenty. Knowing his Sentiments upon this Head, I thought it in
vain to apply my self to <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec596.txt')">Women</a> of Condition, who expect Settlements;
so that all my Amours have hitherto been with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec596.txt')">Ladies</a> who had no
Fortunes: But I know not how to give you so good an Idea of me, as by
laying before you the History of my Life.</p><p>'I can very well remember, that at my School-mistresses, whenever we
broke up, I was always for joining my self with the Miss who _Lay in_,
and was constantly one of the first to make a Party in the Play of
_<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec596.txt')">Husband</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec596.txt')">Wife</a>_. This Passion for being well with the Females still
increased as I advanced in Years. At the Dancing-School I contracted
so many Quarrels by struggling with my Fellow-Scholars for the Partner
I liked best, that upon a Ball Night, before our Mothers made their
Appearance, I was usually up to the Nose in Blood. My Father, like a
discreet Man, soon removed me from this Stage of Softness to a School
of Discipline, where I learnt _Latin and Greek_. I underwent several
Severities in this Place, 'till it was thought convenient to send me
to the University; though, to confess the Truth, I should not have
arrived so early at that Seat of Learning, but from the Discovery of
an Intrigue between me and my Master's House-Keeper; upon whom I had
employed my Rhetorick so effectually, that, though she was a very
elderly <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec596.txt')">Lady</a>, I had almost brought her to consent to marry me. Upon my
Arrival at _Oxford_, I found Logick so dry, that, instead of giving
Attention to the Dead, I soon fell to addressing the Living. My first
Amour was with a pretty Girl whom I shall <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec596.txt')">call</a> _Parthenope_: Her
Mother sold Ale by the Town-Wall. Being often caught there by the
Proctor, I was forced at last, that my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec596.txt')">Mistress</a>'s Reputation might
receive no Blemish, to confess my Addresses were honourable. Upon this
I was immediately sent Home; but _Parthenope_ soon after marrying a
Shoe-maker, I was again suffered to return. My next Affair was with my
Taylor's Daughter, who deserted me for the sake of a young Barber.
Upon my complaining to one of my particular Friends of this
Misfortune, the cruel Wagg made a meer Jest of my Calamity, and asked
me with a Smile, _Where the_ Needle _should turn but to the_ Pole? [1]
After this I was deeply in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec596.txt')">Love</a> with a Milliner, and at last with my
Bed-maker, upon which I was sent away, or in the University Phrase,
_Rusticated_ for ever.</p><p>'Upon my coming home, I settled to my Studies so heartily, and
contracted so great a Reservedness by being kept from the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec596.txt')">Company</a> I
most affected, that my Father thought he might venture me at the
_Temple_.</p><p>'Within a Week after my Arrival I began to shine again, and became
enamour'd with a mighty pretty Creature, who had every thing but Mony
to recommend her. Having frequent Opportunities of uttering all the
soft things which an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec596.txt')">Heart</a> formed for Love could inspire me with, I
soon gained her Consent to treat of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec596.txt')">Marriage</a>; but unfortunately for us
all, in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec596.txt')">Absence</a> of my Charmer I usually talked the same Language
to her elder Sister, who is also very pretty. Now I assure you, Mr.
SPECTATOR, this did not proceed from any real Affection I had
conceived for her; but being a perfect Stranger to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec596.txt')">Conversation</a> of
Men, and strongly addicted to associate with the Women, I knew no
other Language but that of Love. I should however be very much obliged
to you, if you could free me from the Perplexity I am at present in. I
have sent <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec596.txt')">Word</a> to my old Gentleman in the Country, that I am
desperately in Love with the younger Sister! and her Father, who knew
no better, poor Man! acquainted him by the same Post, that I had for
some time made my Addresses to the Elder. Upon this old Testy sends me
up Word, that he has heard so much of my Exploits, that he intends
immediately to order me to the _South-Sea_. Sir, I have occasionally
talked so much of dying, that I begin to think there is not much in
it; and if the old Squire persists in his Design, I do hereby give him
Notice that I am providing my self with proper Instruments for the
Destruction of despairing <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec596.txt')">Lovers</a>; let him therefore look to it, and
consider that by his Obstinacy he may himself lose the Son of his
Strength, the World an hopeful Lawyer, my Mistress a passionate Lover,
and you, Mr. SPECTATOR,</p><p>_Your constant Admirer_,</p><p>Jeremy Lovemore.</p><p>_Middle-Temple_,</p><p>_Sept._ 18.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Sign of a Barber's shop.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
