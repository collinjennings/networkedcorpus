<p>No. 597.             Wednesday, September 22, 1714.             Byrom.</p><p></p><p>'--Metis sine Pondere ludit--'</p><p>Petr.</p><p></p><p>Since I received my <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec597.txt')">Friend</a> _Shadow's_ Letter, several of my
Correspondents have been pleased to send me an Account how they have
been employed in <a name="topic45" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec597.txt')">Sleep</a>, and what notable Adventures they have been
engaged in during that Moonshine in the Brain. I shall lay before my
Readers an Abridgment of some few of their Extravagancies, in hopes that
they will in Time accustom themselves to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec597.txt')">dream</a> a little more to the
Purpose.</p><p>One who styles himself _Gladio_, complains heavily that his Fair One
charges him with Inconstancy, and does not use him with half the
Kindness which the Sincerity of his Passion may demand; the said
_Gladio_ having by Valour and Stratagem put to Death Tyrants,
Inchanters, Monsters, Knights, &c. without Number, and exposed himself
to all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec597.txt')">manner</a> of Dangers for her Sake and Safety. He desires in his
Postscript to know, whether, from a constant Success in them, he may not
promise himself to succeed in her Esteem at last.</p><p>Another who is very prolix in his Narrative writes me <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec597.txt')">Word</a>, that having
sent a Venture beyond Sea, he took Occasion one Night to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec597.txt')">fancy</a> himself
gone along with it, and grown on a sudden the richest Man in all the
_Indies_. Having been there about a Year or two, a Gust of Wind that
forced open his Casement blew him over to his native Country again,
where awaking at Six a Clock, and the Change of the Air not agreeing
with him, he turned to his Left Side in order to a second Voyage: but
e'er he could get on Shipboard, was unfortunately apprehended for
stealing a Horse, try'd and condemn'd for the Fact, and in a fair way of
being executed, if some Body stepping hastily into his Chamber had not
brought him a Reprieve. This Fellow too wants Mr. _Shadow's_ Advice,
who, I dare say, would bid him be content to rise after his first Nap,
and learn to be satisfied as soon as Nature is.</p><p>The next is a publick-spirited Gentleman, who tells me, That on the
Second of September at Night the whole City was on Fire, and would
certainly have been reduced to Ashes again by this Time, if he had not
flown over it with the _New River_ on his Back, and happily extinguished
the Flames before they had prevailed too far. He would be informed
whether he has not a Right to petition the Lord Mayor and Alderman for a
Reward.</p><p>A Letter dated September the Ninth acquaints me, That the Writer being
resolved to try his <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec597.txt')">Fortune</a>, had fasted all that Day; and that he might
be sure of dreaming upon something at Night, procured an handsome Slice
of Bride-Cake, which he placed very conveniently under his Pillow. In
the Morning his Memory happen'd to fail him, and he could recollect
nothing but an odd Fancy that he had eaten his Cake; which being found
upon Search reduced to a few Crums, he is resolved to remember more of
his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec597.txt')">Dreams</a> another Time, believing from this that there may possibly be
somewhat of Truth in them.</p><p>I have received numerous Complaints from several delicious Dreamers,
desiring me to invent some Method of silencing those noisy Slaves, whose
Occupations lead them to take their early Rounds about the City in a
Morning, doing a deal of Mischief; and working strange Confusion in the
Affairs of its Inhabitants. Several Monarchs have done me the Honour to
acquaint me, how often they have been shook from their respective
Thrones by the rattling of a Coach or the rumbling of a Wheel-barrow.
And many private Gentlemen, I find, have been baulk'd of vast Estates by
Fellows not worth Three-pence. A fair Lady was just upon the Point of
being married to a young, handsome, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec597.txt')">rich</a>, ingenious Nobleman, when an
impertinent Tinker passing by, forbid the Banns; and an hopeful Youth,
who had been newly advanced to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec597.txt')">great</a> Honour and Preferment, was forced
by a neighbouring Cobler to resign all for an old Song. It has been
represented to me, that those inconsiderable Rascals do nothing but go
about dissolving of Marriages and spoiling of Fortunes, impoverishing
rich and ruining great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec597.txt')">People</a>, interrupting Beauties in the midst of
their Conquests, and Generals in the Course of their Victories. A
boisterous Peripatetick hardly goes through a Street without <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec597.txt')">waking</a> half
a Dozen Kings and Princes to open their Shops or clean Shoes, frequently
transforming Sceptres into Paring-Shovels, and Proclamations into Bills.
I have by me a Letter from a young Statesman, who in five or six Hours
came to be Emperor of _Europe_, after which he made <a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec597.txt')">War</a> upon the Great
Turk, routed him Horse and Foot, and was crowned Lord of the Universe in
_Constantinople_: the Conclusion of all his Successes is, that on the
12th Instant, about Seven in the Morning, his Imperial Majesty was
deposed by a Chimney--Sweeper.</p><p>On the other hand, I have Epistolary Testimonies of Gratitude from many
miserable People, who owe to this clamorous Tribe frequent Deliverances
from great Misfortunes. A Small-coalman, [1] by waking of one of these
distressed Gentlemen, saved him from ten Years Imprisonment. An honest
Watchman bidding aloud Good-morrow to another, freed him from the Malice
of many potent Enemies, and brought all their Designs against him to
nothing. A certain Valetudinarian confesses he has often been cured of a
sore Throat by the Hoarseness of a Carman, and relieved from a Fit of
the Gout by the Sound of _old Shoes_. A noisy Puppy that plagued a sober
Gentleman all Night long with his Impertinence, was silenced by a
Cinder-Wench with a Word speaking.</p><p>Instead therefore of suppressing this Order of Mortals, I would propose
it to my Readers to make the best Advantage of their Morning
Salutations. A famous _Macedonian_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec597.txt')">Prince</a>, for fear of forgetting
himself in the midst of his good Fortune, had a Youth to wait on him
every Morning, and bid him remember that he was a Man. A Citizen who is
waked by one of these Criers, may regard him as a kind of Remembrancer,
come to admonish him that it is time to return to the Circumstances he
has overlooked all the Night-time, to leave off fancying himself what he
is not, and prepare to act suitably to the Condition he is really placed
in.</p><p>People may dream on as long as they please, but I shall take no Notice
of any Imaginary Adventures that do not happen while the Sun is on this
Side of the Horizon. For which Reason I stifle _Fritilla's_ Dream at
Church last _Sunday_, who while the rest of the Audience were enjoying
the Benefit of an excellent Discourse, was losing her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec597.txt')">Money</a> and Jewels
to a Gentleman at Play, till after a strange Run of ill Luck she was
reduced to pawn three lovely pretty Children for her last Stake. When
she had thrown them away her Companion went off, discovering himself by
his usual Tokens, a cloven Foot and a strong Smell of Brimstone; which
last proved only a Bottle of Spirits, which a good old Lady applied to
her Nose, to put her in a Condition of hearing the Preacher's third Head
concerning Time.</p><p>If a Man has no Mind to pass abruptly from his imagined to his real
Circumstances, he may employ himself a while in that new kind of
Observation which my Onicrocritical Correspondent has directed him to
make of himself. Pursuing the Imagination through all its
Extravagancies, whether in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec597.txt')">Sleeping</a> or Waking, is no improper Method of
correcting and bringing it to act in Subordinancy to Reason, so as to be
delighted only with such Objects as will affect it with Pleasure, when
it is never so cool and sedate.</p><p></p><p>
