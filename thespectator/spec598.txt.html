<p>No. 598.              Friday, September 24, 1714.             Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Jamne igitur laudas, quod de sapientibus alter
Ridebat, quoties a limine moverat unum
Protuleratque pedem: flebat contrarius alter?'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>Mankind may be divided into the <a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec598.txt')">Merry</a> and the Serious, who, both of
them, make a very good Figure in the Species, so long as they keep their
respective Humours from degenerating into the neighbouring Extreme;
there being a natural Tendency in the one to a melancholy Moroseness,
and in the other to a fantastick Levity.</p><p>The merry Part of the World are very amiable, whilst they diffuse a
Chearfulness through <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec598.txt')">Conversation</a> at proper Seasons and on proper
Occasions; but, on the contrary, a great Grievance to Society, when they
infect every Discourse with insipid <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec598.txt')">Mirth</a>, and turn into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec598.txt')">Ridicule</a> such
Subjects as are not suited to it. For though <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec598.txt')">Laughter</a> is looked upon by
the Philosophers as the Property of Reason, the Excess of it has been
always considered as the Mark of Folly.</p><p>On the other Side, Seriousness has its Beauty whilst it is attended with
Chearfulness and Humanity, and does not come in unseasonably to pall the
good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec598.txt')">Humour</a> of those with whom we converse.</p><p>These two Sets of Men, notwithstanding they each of them shine in their
respective Characters, are apt to bear a natural Aversion and Antipathy
to one another.</p><p>What is more usual, than to hear Men of serious Tempers and austere
Morals, enlarging upon the Vanities and Follies of the young and gay
Part of the Species; whilst they look with a kind of Horror upon such
Pomps and Diversions as are innocent in themselves, and only culpable
when they draw the Mind too much?</p><p>I could not but smile upon reading a Passage in the Account which Mr.
_Baxter_ gives of his own Life, wherein he represents it as a great
Blessing, that in his Youth he very narrowly escaped getting a Place at
Court.</p><p>It must indeed be confessed that Levity of Tamper takes a Man off his
Guard, and opens a Pass to his Soul for any Temptation that assaults it.
It favours all the Approaches of Vice, and weakens all the Resistance of
Virtue. For which Reason a renowned Statesman in Queen _Elizabeth's_
Days, after having retir'd from Court and publick Business, in order to
give himself up to the Duties of Religion; when any of his old Friends
used to visit him, had still this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec598.txt')">Word</a> of Advice in his Mouth, _Be
serious._</p><p>An eminent _Italian_ Author of this Cast of Mind, speaking of the great
Advantage of a serious and composed Temper, wishes very gravely, that
for the Benefit of Mankind he had _Trophonius's_ Cave in his Possession;
which, says he, would contribute more to the Reformation of Manners than
all the Work-houses and Bridewells in _Europe_.</p><p>We have a very particular Description of this Cave in _Pausanias_, who
tells us, that it was made in the Form of a huge Oven, and had many
particular Circumstances, which disposed the Person who was in it to be
more pensive and thoughtful than ordinary; insomuch that no Man was ever
observed to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec598.txt')">laugh</a> all his Life after, who had once made his Entry into
this Cave. It was usual in those Times, when any one carried a more than
ordinary Gloominess in his Features, to tell him that he looked like one
just come out of _Trophonius's_ Cave.</p><p>On the other hand, Writers of a more merry Complexion have been no less
severe on the opposite Party; and have had one Advantage above them,
that they have attacked them with more Turns of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec598.txt')">Wit</a> and Humour.</p><p>After all, if a Man's Temper were at his own Disposal, I think he would
not chuse to be of either of these Parties; since the most perfect
Character is that which is formed out of both of them. A Man would
neither chuse to be a Hermit nor a Buffoon: Humane Nature is not so
miserable, as that we should be always melancholy; nor so happy, as that
we should be always merry. In a Word, a Man should not live as if there
was no God in the World; nor, at the same Time, as if there were no Men
in it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
