<p>No. 599.                 Monday, September 27, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Ubique
Luctus, ubique pavor--'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>It has been my Custom, as I grow old, to allow my self in some little
Indulgencies which I never took in my Youth. Among others is that of an
Afternoon's Napp, which I fell into in the Fifty fifth Year of my Age,
and have continued for the three Years last past. By this means I enjoy
a double Morning, and rise twice a-day fresh to my Speculations. It
happens very luckily for me, that some of my Dreams have proved
instructive to my Countrymen, so that I may be said to sleep, as well as
to wake, for the Good of the Publick. I was Yesterday meditating on the
Account with which I have already entertained my Readers concerning the
Cave of _Trophonius_. I was no sooner fallen into my usual Slumber, but
I dreamt that this Cave was put into my Possession, and that I gave
publick Notice of its Virtue, inviting every one to it, who had a mind
to be a serious Man for the remaining Part of his Life. Great Multitudes
immediately resorted to me. The first who made the Experiment was a
_<a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec599.txt')">Merry</a>-Andrew_, who was put into my Hands by a neighbouring Justice of
Peace, in order to reclaim him from that profligate kind of Life. Poor
Pickle-herring had not taken above one Turn in it, when he came out of
the Cave, like a Hermit from his Cell, with a penitential Look, and a
most rueful <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec599.txt')">Countenance</a>. I then put in a <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec599.txt')">young</a> laughing Fop, and,
watching for his Return, asked him, with a Smile, how he liked the
Place? He replied, Pr'ythee <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec599.txt')">Friend</a> be not impertinent; and stalked by me
as grave as a Judge. A Citizen then desired me to give free Ingress and
Egress to his Wife, who was dressed in the gayest coloured Ribbons I had
ever seen. She went in with a Flirt of her Fan and a smirking
Countenance, but came out with a Severity of a Vestal, and throwing from
her several <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec599.txt')">Female</a> Gugaws, told me with a Sigh, that she resolved to go
into deep Mourning, and to wear Black all the rest of her Life. As I had
many Coquets recommended to me by their Parents, their Husbands, and
their Lovers, I let them in all at once, desiring them to divert
themselves together as well as they could. Upon their emerging again
into Day-light, you would have fancied my Cave to have been a Nunnery,
and that you had seen a solemn Procession of Religious marching out, one
behind another, in the most profound Silence and the most exemplary
Decency. As I was very much delighted with so edifying a Sight, there
came towards me a great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec599.txt')">Company</a> of Males and Females laughing, singing,
and dancing, in such a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec599.txt')">manner</a> that I could hear them a great while
before I saw them. Upon my asking their Leader, what brought them
thither? they told me all at once, that they were _French_ Protestants
lately arrived in _Great-Britain_, and that finding themselves of too
Gay a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec599.txt')">Humour</a> for my Country, they applyed themselves to me in order to
compose them for _British_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec599.txt')">Conversation</a>. I told them, that to oblige
them I would soon spoil their <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec599.txt')">Mirth</a>; upon which I admitted a whole Shole
of them, who, after having taken a Survey of the Place, came out in a
very good Order, and with Looks entirely _English_. I afterwards put in
a _Dutch_ Man, who had a great Fancy to see the _Kelder_, as he called
it, but I could not observe that it had made any manner of Alteration in
him.</p><p>A Comedian who had gained great Reputation in Parts of Humour, told me,
that he had a mighty Mind to act _Alexander_ the Great, and fancied that
he should succeed very well in it, if he could strike two or three
laughing Features out of his Face: He tried the Experiment, but
contracted so very solid a Look by it, that I am afraid he will be fit
for no Part hereafter but a _Timon_ of _Athens_, or a Mute in the
_Funeral_.</p><p>I then clapt up an empty fantastic Citizen, in order to qualifie him for
an Alderman. He was succeeded by a young Rake of the _Middle-Temple_,
who was brought to me by his Grandmother; but to her great Sorrow and
Surprize, he came out a _Quaker_. Seeing my self surrounded with a Body
of _Free-thinkers_, and Scoffers at Religion, who were making themselves
merry at the sober Looks and thoughtful Brows of those who had been in
the Cave; I thrust them all in, one after another, and locked the Door
upon 'em. Upon my opening it, they all looked, as if they had been
frighted out of their Wits, and were marching away with Ropes in their
Hands to a Wood that was within Sight of the Place. I found they were
not able to bear themselves in their first serious Thoughts; but knowing
these would quickly bring them to a better Frame of Mind, I gave them
into the Custody of their Friends 'till that happy Change was wrought in
them.</p><p>The last that was brought to me was a young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec599.txt')">Woman</a>, who at the first
Sight of my short Face fell into an immoderate fit of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec599.txt')">Laughter</a>, and was
forced to hold her Sides all the while her Mother was speaking to me.
Upon this I interrupted the old <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec599.txt')">Lady</a>, and taking her Daughter by the
Hand, Madam, said I, be pleased to retire into my Closet, while your
Mother tells me your Case. I then put her into the Mouth of the Cave,
when the Mother, after having begg'd Pardon for the Girl's Rudeness,
told me, that she often treated her Father and the gravest of her
Relations in the same manner; that she would sit giggling and laughing
with her Companions from one End of a Tragedy to the other; nay, that
she would sometimes burst out in the Middle of a Sermon, and set the
whole Congregation a staring at her. The Mother was going on, when the
young Lady came out of the Cave to us with a composed Countenance, and a
low Curtsie. She was a Girl of such exuberant Mirth, that her Visit to
_Trophonius_ only reduced her to a more than ordinary Decency of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec599.txt')">Behaviour</a>, and made a very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec599.txt')">pretty</a> Prude of her. After having performed
innumerable Cures, I looked about me with great Satisfaction, and saw
all my Patients walking by themselves in a very Pensive and musing
Posture, so that the whole Place seem'd covered with Philosophers. I was
at length resolv'd to go into the Cave my self, and see what it was that
had produced such wonderful Effects upon the Company; but as I was
stooping at the Entrance, the Door being something low, I gave such a
Nodd in my Chair, that I awaked. After having recovered my self from my
first Startle, I was very well pleas'd at the Accident which had
befallen me, as not knowing but a little Stay in the Place might have
spoiled my SPECTATORS.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
