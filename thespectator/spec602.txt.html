<p>No. 602.                 Monday, October 4, 1714               Budgell.</p><p></p><p>'--Facit hoc illos Hyacinthos--'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>The following Letter comes from a Gentleman, who, I find, is very
dilgent in making his Observations, which I think too material not to be
communicated to the Publick.</p><p>
SIR,</p><p>'In order to execute the Office of Love-Casuist to _Great Britain_,
with which I take my self to be invested by your Paper of September 8,
[1] I shall make some further Observations upon the two Sexes in
general, beginning with that which always ought to have the upper
Hand. After having observed with much Curiosity the Accomplishments
which are apt to captivate <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec602.txt')">female</a> Hearts, I find that there is no
Person so irresistable as one who is a Man of Importance, provided it
be in Matters of no Consequence. One who makes himself talked of, tho'
it be for the particular Cock of his <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec602.txt')">Hat</a>, or for prating aloud in the
Boxes at a Play, is in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec602.txt')">fair</a> way of being a Favourite. I have known a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec602.txt')">young</a> Fellow make his Fortune by knocking down a Constable; and may
venture to say, tho' it may seem a Paradox, that many a Fair One has
died by a Duel in which both the Combatants have survived.</p><p>About three Winters ago I took Notice of a young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec602.txt')">Lady</a> at the Theatre,
who convceived of a Passion for a notorious Rake that headed a Party
of Cat-calls; and am credibly informed, that the Emperor of the
Mohocks married a rich Widow within three Weeks after having rendered
himself formidable in the Cities of _London_ and _Westminster_.
Scowring and breaking Windows have done frequent Execution upon the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec602.txt')">Sex</a>; but there is no Sett of these Male Charmers who make their way
more successfully, than those who have gained themselves a Name for
Intrigue, and have ruined the greatest Number of Reputations. There is
a strange Curiosity in the female World to be acquainted with the dear
Man who has been loved by others, and to know what it is that makes
him so <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec602.txt')">agreeable</a>. His Reputation does more than half his Business.
Every one that is ambitious of being a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec602.txt')">Woman</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec602.txt')">Fashion</a>, looks out for
Opportunities of being in his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec602.txt')">Company</a>; so that to use the old Proverb,
When his Name is up he may lie a-Bed.</p><p>'I was very sensible of the great Advantage of being a Man of
Importance upon these Occasions on the Day of the King's Entry, when I
was seated in a Balcony behind a Cluster of very <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec602.txt')">pretty</a> Country
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec602.txt')">Ladies</a>, who had one of these showy Gentlemen in the midst of them. The
first Trick I caught him at was bowing to several Persons of Quality
whom he did not know; nay, he had the Impudence to hem at a Blue
Garter who had a finer Equipage than ordinary, and seemed a little
concerned at the Impertinent Huzzas of the Mob, that hindered his
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec602.txt')">Friend</a> from taking Notice of him. There was indeed one who pull'd off
his Hat to him, and upon the Ladies asking who it was, he told them,
it was a Foreign Minister that he had been very merry with the Night
before; whereas in Truth, it was the City Common Hunt.</p><p>'He was never at a Loss when he was asked any Person's Name, tho' he
seldom knew any one under a Peer. He found Dukes and Earls among the
Aldermen, very good-natured Fellows among the Privy-Counsellors, with
two or three agreeable old Rakes among the Bishops and Judges.</p><p>'In short, I collected from his whole Discourse, that he was
acquainted with every Body, and knew no Body. At the same Time, I am
mistaken if he did not that Day make more Advances in the Affections
of his Mistress, who sat near him, than he could have done in half a
Year's Courtship.</p><p>'_Ovid_ has finely touched this Method of making Love, which I shall
here give my Reader in Mr. _Dryden's_ Translation.</p><p>Page the Eleventh.</p><p>'Thus Love in Theatres did first improve,
And Theatres are still the Scene of Love:
Nor shun the Chariots, and the Coursers Race;
The Circus is no inconvenient Place.
Nor Need is there of talking on the Hand,
Nor Nods, nor Sighs, which Lovers understand;
But boldly next the Fair your Seat provide,
Close as you can to hers, and Side by Side:
Pleas'd or unpleas'd, no Matter; crowding sit;
For so the Laws of publick Shows permit.
Then find Occasion to begin Discourse,
Enquire whose Chariot this, and whose that Horse;
To whatsoever Side she is inclin'd,
Suit all your Inclinations to her Mind;
Like what she likes, from thence your Court begin,
And whom she favours, wish that he may win.'</p><p>Again, Page the Sixteenth.</p><p>'O when will come the Day, by Heav'n design'd,
When thou, the best and fairest of Mankind,
Drawn by white Horses, shall in Triumph ride,
With conquer'd Slaves attending on thy Side;
Slaves, that no longer can be safe in flight,
O glorious Object! O surprizing Sight!
O Day of publick Joy, too good to end in Night!
On such a Day, if thou, and next to thee
Some <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec602.txt')">Beauty</a> sits, the Spectacle to see;
If she enquire the Names of conquer'd Kings,
Of Mountains, Rivers, and their hidden Springs;
Answer to all thou knowest; and, if Need be,
Of Things unknown seem to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec602.txt')">speak</a> knowingly:
This is_ Euphrates, _crown'd with Reeds; and there
Flows the swift_ Tigris, _with his Sea-green hair,
Invent new Names of Things unknown before;
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec602.txt')">Call</a> this_ Armenia, _that, the_ Caspian _Shore:
Call this a_ Mede, _and that a_ Parthian _Youth;
Talk probably; no Matter for the Truth.'</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: No. 591]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
