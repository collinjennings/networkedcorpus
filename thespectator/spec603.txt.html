<p>No. 603.              Wednesday, October 6, 1714.               Byrom.</p><p></p><p>'Ducite ab Urbe Domum, mea Carmina, ducite Daphnim.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>The following Copy of Verses comes from one of my Correspondents, and
has something in it so Original, that I do not much doubt but it will
divert my Readers [1].</p><p>
I.      My Time, O ye Muses, was happily spent,
When_ Phebe _went with me wherever I went;
Ten thousand <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec603.txt')">sweet</a> Pleasures I felt in my Breast:
Sure never fond Shepherd like_ Colin _was blest!
But now she is gone, and has left me behind,
What a marvellous Change on a sudden I find?
When things were as fine as could possibly be,
I thought 'twas the Spring; but alas! it was she.</p><p>
II.     With such a Companion, to tend a few Sheep,
To rise up and play, or to lye down and sleep:
I was so good-humour'd, so chearful and gay,
My <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec603.txt')">Heart</a> was as light as a Feather all Day.
But now I so cross and so peevish am grown;
So strangely uneasie as ever was known.
My Fair one is gone, and my Joys are all drown'd,
And my Heart--I am sure it weighs more than a Pound.</p><p>
III.    The Fountain that wont to run sweetly along,
And dance to soft Murmurs the Pebbles among,
Thou know'st, little Cupid, if_ Phebe _was there,
'Twas Pleasure to look at, 'twas Musick to hear:
But now she is absent, I walk by its Side,
And still as it murmurs do nothing but chide,
Must you be so chearful, while I go in Pain?
Peace there with your Bubbling, and hear me complain.</p><p>
IV.     When my Lambkins around me would oftentimes play,
And when_ Phebe _and I were as joyful as they,
How pleasant their Sporting, how happy the Time,
When Spring, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec603.txt')">Love</a> and Beauty were all in their Prime?
But now in their Frolicks when by me they pass,
I fling at their Fleeces an handful of Grass;
Be still then, I cry, for it makes me quite mad,
To see you so merry, while I am so sad.</p><p>
V.      My Dog I was ever well pleased to see
Come wagging his Tail to my Fair one and me;
And_ Phebe _was pleas'd too, and to my Dog said,
Come hither, poor Fellow; and patted his Head.
But now, when he's fawning, I with a sour Look
Cry, Sirrah; and give him a Blow with my Crook:
And I'll give him another; for why should not_ Tray
_Be as dull as his Master, when_ Phebe's _away?</p><p>
VI.     When walking with_ Phebe, _what Sights have I seen?
How fair was the Flower, how fresh was the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec603.txt')">Green</a>?
What a lovely appearance the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec603.txt')">Trees</a> and the Shade,
The Corn-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec603.txt')">fields</a> and Hedges, and ev'ry thing made?
But now she has left me, tho' all are still there,
They none of 'em now so delightful appear:
'Twas nought but the Magick, I find, of her Eyes,
Made so many <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec603.txt')">beautiful</a> Prospects arise.</p><p>
VII.    Sweet Musick went with us both all the Wood thro',
The Lark, Linnet, Throstle, and Nightingale too;
Winds over us whisper'd, Flocks by us did bleat,
And chirp went the Grasshopper under our Feet.
But now she is absent, tho' still they sing on,
The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec603.txt')">Woods</a> are but lonely, the Melody's gone:
Her Voice in the Consort, as now I have found,
Gave ev'ry thing else its <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec603.txt')">agreeable</a> Sound.</p><p>
VIII.   Rose, what is become of thy delicate Hue?
And where is the Violet's beautiful Blue?
Does ought of its Sweetness the Blossom beguile,
That Meadow, those Dasies, why do they not smile?
Ah! Rivals, I see what it was that you drest
And made your selves fine for; a Place in her Breast:
You put on your Colours to pleasure her Eye,
To be pluckt by her Hand, on her Bosom to die.</p><p>
IX.     How slowly Time creeps, till my_ Phebe _return!
While amidst the soft Zephyr's cold Breezes I burn;
Methinks if I knew whereabouts he would tread,
I could breathe on his Wings, and 'twould melt down the Lead.
Fly swifter, ye Minutes, bring hither my Dear,
And rest so much longer for't when she is here.
Ah_ Colin! _old Time is full of Delay,
Nor will budge one Foot faster for all thou canst say.</p><p>
X.      Will no pitying Power that hears me complain,
Or cure my Disquiet, or soften my Pain?
To be cur'd, thou must_, Colin, _thy <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec603.txt')">Passion</a> remove;
But what Swain is so silly to live without Love?
No, Deity, bid the dear Nymph to return,
For ne'er was poor Shepherd so sadly forlorn.
Ah! What shall I do? I shall die with Despair;
Take heed, all ye Swains, how ye love one so fair.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: It is said that John Byrom wrote these verses in honour of
