<p>No. 604.                  Friday, October 8, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'Tu ne qu√¶sieris (scire nefas) quem mihi, quem tibi,
Finem Dii dederint, Leuconoe; nec Babylonios
Tentaris numeros--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>The Desire of knowing future Events is one of the strongest Inclinations
in the Mind of <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec604.txt')">Man</a>. Indeed an Ability of foreseeing probable Accidents
is what, in the Language of Men, is called Wisdom and Prudence: But, not
satisfied with the Light that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec604.txt')">Reason</a> holds out, Mankind hath endeavoured
to penetrate more compendiously into Futurity. Magick, Oracles, Omens,
lucky Hours, and the various Arts of Superstition, owe their Rise to
this powerful Cause. As this Principle is founded in Self-Love, every
Man is sure to be sollicitous in the first Place about his own <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec604.txt')">Fortune</a>,
the Course of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec604.txt')">Life</a>, and the Time and <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec604.txt')">Manner</a> of his <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec604.txt')">Death</a>.</p><p>If we consider that we are free Agents, we shall discover the Absurdity
of Enquiries. One of our <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec604.txt')">Actions</a>, which we might have performed or
neglected, is the Cause of another that succeeds it, and so the whole
Chain of Life is link'd together. Pain, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec604.txt')">Poverty</a>, or Infamy, are the
natural Product of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec604.txt')">vicious</a> and imprudent Acts; as the contrary Blessings
are of good ones; so that we cannot suppose our Lot to be determined
without Impiety. A <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec604.txt')">great</a> Enhancement of Pleasure arises from its being
unexpected; and Pain is doubled by being foreseen. Upon all these, and
several other Accounts, we ought to rest satisfied in this Portion
bestowed on us; to adore the Hand that hath fitted every Thing to our
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec604.txt')">Nature</a>, and hath not more display'd his Goodness in our Knowledge than
in our Ignorance.</p><p>It is not unworthy Observation, that superstitious Enquiries into future
Events prevail more or less, in proportion to the Improvement of liberal
Arts and useful Knowledge in the several Parts of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec604.txt')">World</a>. Accordingly
we find, that magical Incantations remain in _Lapland_, in the more
remote Parts of _Scotland_ they have their second Sight, and several of
our own Countrymen see abundance of Fairies. In _Asia_ this Credulity is
strong; and the greatest Part of refined Learning there consists in the
Knowledge of Amulets, Talismans, occult Numbers, and the like.</p><p>While I was at _Grand Cairo_, I fell into the Acquaintance of a
good-natured Mussulman, who promised me many good Offices, which he
designed to do me when he became the Prime Minister, which was a Fortune
bestowed on his Imagination by a Doctor very deep in the curious
Sciences. At his repeated Sollicitations I went to learn my Destiny of
this wonderful Sage. For a small Sum I had his Promise, but was requir'd
to wait in a dark Apartment till he had run thro' the preparatory
Ceremonies. Having a strong Propensity, even then, to Dreaming, I took a
Nap upon the Sofa where I was placed, and had the following <a name="topic45" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec604.txt')">Vision</a>, the
Particulars whereof I picked up the other Day among my Papers.</p><p>I found my self in an unbounded Plain, where <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec604.txt')">methought</a> the whole World,
in several Habits and with different Tongues, was assembled. The
Multitude glided swiftly along, and I found in my self a strong
Inclination to mingle in the Train. My Eyes quickly singled out some of
the most splendid Figures. Several in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec604.txt')">rich</a> Caftans and glittering
Turbans bustled through the Throng, and trampled over the Bodies of
those they threw down; till to my great Surprize I found that the great
Pace they went only hastened them to a Scaffold or a Bowstring. Many
beautiful Damsels on the other Side moved forward with great Gaiety;
some danced till they fell all along; and others painted their Faces
till they lost their Noses. A Tribe of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec604.txt')">Creatures</a> with busie Looks
falling into a Fit of Laughter at the Misfortunes of the unhappy Ladies,
I turn'd my Eyes upon them. They were each of them filling his Pockets
with Gold and Jewels, and when there was no Room left for more, these
Wretches looking round with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec604.txt')">Fear</a> and Horror, pined away before my Face
with Famine and Discontent.</p><p>This Prospect of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec604.txt')">human</a> Misery struck me dumb for some Miles. Then it was
that, to disburthen my Mind, I took Pen and Ink, and did every Thing
that hath since happen'd under my Office of SPECTATOR. While I was
employing my self for the Good of Mankind, I was surpriz'd to meet with
very unsuitable Returns from my Fellow-Creatures. Never was <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec604.txt')">poor</a> Author
so beset with Pamphleteers, who sometimes marched directly against me,
but oftner shot at me from strong Bulwarks, or rose up suddenly in
Ambush. They were of all Characters and Capacities, some with Ensigns of
Dignity, and others in Liveries; but what most surpriz'd me, was to see
two or three in black Gowns among my Enemies. It was no small Trouble to
me, sometimes to have a Man come up to me with an angry Face, and
reproach me for having lampooned him, when I had never seen or heard of
him in my Life. With the Ladies it was otherwise: Many became my Enemies
for not being particularly pointed out; as there were others who
resented the Satyr which they imagined I had directed against them. My
great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec604.txt')">Comfort</a> was in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec604.txt')">Company</a> of half a Dozen Friends, who, I found
since, were the Club which I have so often mentioned in my Papers. I
laughed often at _Sir Roger_ in my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec604.txt')">Sleep</a>, and was the more diverted with
_Will Honeycomb's_ Gallantries, (when we afterwards became acquainted)
because I had foreseen his Marriage with a Farmer's Daughter. The Regret
which arose in my Mind upon the Death of my Companions, my Anxieties for
the Publick, and the many Calamities still fleeting before my Eyes, made
me repent my Curiosity; when the Magician entered the Room, and awakened
me, by telling me (when it was too late) that he was just going to
begin.</p><p>_N. B._ I have only deliver'd the Prophecy of that Part of my Life which
is past, it being inconvenient to divulge the second Part 'till a more
proper Opportunity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
