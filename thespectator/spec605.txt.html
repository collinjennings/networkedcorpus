<p>No. 605.               Monday, October 11, 1714.              Budgell.</p><p></p><p>'Exuerint sylvestrem animum, cultuque frequenti
In quascunque voces artes, haud tarda sequentur.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>Having perused the following Letter, and finding it to run upon the
Subject of <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec605.txt')">Love</a>, I referred it to the Learned _Casuist_, whom I have
retained in my Service for Speculations of that Kind. He return'd it to
me the next Morning with his Report annexed to it, with both of which I
shall here present my Reader.</p><p>
_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Finding that you have Entertained an useful Person in your Service in
quality of _Love-Casuist_, [1] I apply my self to you, under a very
<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec605.txt')">great</a> Difficulty, that hath for some Months perplexed me. I have a
Couple of humble Servants, one of which I have no Aversion to; the
other I think of very kindly. The first hath the Reputation of a Man
of good Sense, and is one of those <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec605.txt')">People</a> that your Sex are apt to
Value. My Spark is reckoned a Coxcomb among the Men, but is a
Favourite of the Ladies. If I marry the Man of Worth, as they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec605.txt')">call</a>
him, I shall oblige my Parents and improve my Fortune; but with my
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec605.txt')">dear</a> Beau I promise my self Happiness, altho' not a Jointure. Now I
would ask you, whether I should consent to lead my Life with a Man
that I have only no Objection to, or with him against whom all
Objections to me appear frivolous. I am determined to follow the
_Casuist's_ Advice, and I dare say he will not put me upon so serious
a thing as Matrimony, contrary to my Inclination.'</p><p>I am, &c.</p><p>_Fanny Fickle_.</p><p>_P.S._ 'I forgot to tell you, that the pretty Gentleman is the most
complaisant Creature in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec605.txt')">World</a>, and is always of my Mind; but the
other, forsooth, fancies he hath as much Wit as my self, slights my
Lap-Dog, and hath the Insolence to contradict me when he thinks I am
not in the Right. About half an Hour ago, he maintained to my Face,
that a Patch always implies a Pimple.'</p><p>
As I look upon it to be my Duty rather to side with the Parents than the
Daughter, I shall propose some Considerations to my Gentle Querist,
which may encline her to comply with those, under whose Direction she
is: And at the same time, convince her, that it is not impossible but
she may, in time, have a true Affection for him who is, at present,
indifferent to her: Or, to use the old Family Maxim, that _If she
marries first, Love will come after_.</p><p>The only Objection, that she seems to insinuate against the Gentleman
proposed to her, is his want of Complaisance, which, I perceive, she is
very willing to return. Now, I can discover from this very Circumstance,
that she and her Lover, whatever they may think of it, are very good
Friends in their Hearts. It is difficult to determine, whether Love
delights more in giving Pleasure or Pain. Let Miss _Fickle_ ask her own
Heart, if she doth not take a Secret Pride in making this Man of good
Sense look very silly. Hath she ever been better pleas'd, than when her
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec605.txt')">Behaviour</a> hath made her Lover ready to hang himself? Or doth she ever
rejoice more, than when she thinks she hath driven him to the very Brink
of a purling Stream? Let her consider, at the same time, that it is not
impossible but her Lover may have discovered her Tricks, and hath a Mind
to give her as good as she brings. I remember a handsome young Baggage
that treated a hopeful _Greek_ of my Acquaintance, just come from
_Oxford_, as if he had been a _Barbarian_. The first Week, after she had
fixed him, she took a Pinch of Snuff out of his Rival's Box, and
apparently touched the Enemy's little Finger. She became a profest Enemy
to the Arts and Sciences, and scarce ever wrote a Letter to him without
wilfully mis-spelling his Name. The young Scholar, to be even with her,
railed at _Coquettes_ as soon as he had got the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec605.txt')">Word</a>; and did not want
Parts to turn into Ridicule her Men of Wit and Pleasure of the Town.
After having irritated one another for the Space of five Months, she
made an Assignation with him fourscore Miles from _London_. But as he
was very well acquainted with her Pranks, he took a Journey the quite
contrary Way. Accordingly they met, quarrell'd, and in a few Days were
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec605.txt')">Married</a>. Their former Hostilities are now the Subject of their Mirth,
being content at present with that Part of Love only which bestows
Pleasure.</p><p><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec605.txt')">Women</a>, who have been married some time, not having it in their Heads to
draw after them a numerous Train of Followers, find their Satisfaction
in the Possession of one Man's Heart. I know very well, that Ladies in
their Bloom desire to be excused in this Particular. But when Time hath
worn out their natural Vanity and taught them Discretion, their Fondness
settles on its proper Object. And it is probably for this Reason, that
among <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec605.txt')">Husbands</a>, you will find more that are fond of Women beyond their
Prime, than of those who are actually in the Insolence of Beauty. My
Reader will apply the same Observation to the other Sex.</p><p>I need not insist upon the Necessity of their pursuing one common
Interest, and their united Care, for their Children; but shall only
observe, by the Way, that married Persons are both more warm in their
Love, and more hearty in their Hatred, than any others whatsoever.
Mutual Favours and Obligations, which may be supposed to be greater here
than in any other State, naturally beget an Intense Affection in
generous Minds. As, on the contrary, Persons who have bestowed such
Favours, have a particular Bitterness in their Resentments, when they
think themselves ill treated by those of whom they have deserved so
much.</p><p>Besides, Miss _Fickle_ may consider, that as there are often many Faults
conceal'd before <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec605.txt')">Marriage</a>, so there are sometimes many Virtues
unobserv'd.</p><p>To this we may add the great Efficacy of Custom, and constant
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec605.txt')">Conversation</a>, to produce a mutual Friendship and Benevolence in two
Persons. It is a nice Reflection, which I have heard a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec605.txt')">Friend</a> of mine
make, that you may be sure a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec605.txt')">Woman</a> loves a Man, when she uses his
Expressions, tells his Stories, or imitates his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec605.txt')">Manner</a>. This gives a
secret Delight; for Imitation is a kind of artless Flattery, and
mightily favours the powerful Principle of Self-love. It is certain,
that married Persons, who are possest with a mutual Esteem, not only
catch the Air and way of Talk from one another, but fall into the same
Traces of thinking and liking. Nay, some have carried the Remark so far
as to assert, that the Features of Man and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec605.txt')">Wife</a> grow, in time, to
resemble one another. Let my fair Correspondent therefore consider, that
the Gentleman recommended will have a good deal of her own Face in two
or three Years; which she must not expect from the Beau, who is too full
of his dear self to copy after another. And I dare appeal to her own
Judgment, if that Person will not be the handsomest, that is the most
like her self.</p><p>We have a remarkable Instance to our present Purpose in the History of
King _Edgar_, which I shall here relate, and leave it with my fair
Correspondent to be applied to her self.</p><p>This great Monarch, who is so famous in _British_ Story, fell in Love,
as he made his Progress through his Kingdom, with a certain Duke's
Daughter who lived near _Winchester_, and was the most celebrated Beauty
of the Age. His Importunities and the Violence of his Passion were so
great, that the Mother of the young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec605.txt')">Lady</a> promised him to bring her
Daughter to his Bed the next Night, though in her Heart she abhorr'd so
infamous an Office. It was no sooner dark than she convey'd into his
Room a young Maid of no disagreeable Figure, who was one of her
Attendants, and did not want Address to improve the Opportunity for the
Advancement of her Fortune. She made so good use of her Time, that when
she offered to rise a little before Day, the King could by no means
think of parting with her. So that finding herself under a Necessity of
discovering who she was, she did it in so handsome a Manner, that his
Majesty was exceeding gracious to her, and took her ever after under his
Protection; insomuch that our Chronicles tell us he carried her along
with him, made her his first Minister of State, and continued true to
her alone, 'till his Marriage with the beautiful _Elfrida_.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: See Nos. 591, 602, 614, 623, 625.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
