<p>No. 606.                Wednesday, October 13, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--longum cantu solata laborem
Arguto Conjux percurrit pectine Telas.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I have a couple of Nieces under my Direction, who so often run
gadding abroad, that I don't know where to have them. Their <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec606.txt')">Dress</a>,
their Tea, and their Visits take up all their Time, and they go to Bed
as tired with doing nothing, as I am after quilting a whole
Under-<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec606.txt')">Petticoat</a>. The only time they are not idle, is while they read
your SPECTATORS; which being dedicated to the Interests of Virtue, I
desire you to recommend the long neglected Art of Needle-work. Those
Hours which in this Age are thrown away in Dress, Play, Visits, and
the like, were employ'd, in my time, in writing out Receipts, or
working Beds, Chairs, and Hangings for the Family. For my Part, I have
ply'd my Needle these fifty Years, and by my good Will would never
have it out of my Hand. It grieves my Heart to see a couple of proud
idle Flirts sipping their Tea, for a whole Afternoon, in a Room hung
<a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec606.txt')">round</a> with the Industry of their <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec606.txt')">Great</a> Grandmother. Pray, Sir, take
the laudable Mystery of Embroidery into your serious Consideration,
and as you have a great deal of the Virtue of the last Age in you,
continue your Endeavours to reform the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec606.txt')">present</a>.'</p><p>_I am_, &c.</p><p>
In Obedience to the Commands of my venerable Correspondent, I have duly
weigh'd this important Subject, and promise my self, from the Arguments
here laid down, that all the fine <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec606.txt')">Ladies</a> of _England_ will be ready, as
soon as their Mourning is over, [1] to appear covered with the Work of
their own Hands.</p><p>What a delightful Entertainment must it be to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec606.txt')">Fair</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec606.txt')">Sex</a>, whom their
native Modesty, and the Tenderness of Men towards them, exempts from
Publick Business, to pass their Hours in imitating Fruits and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec606.txt')">Flowers</a>,
and transplanting all the Beauties of Nature into their own Dress, or
raising a new Creation in their Closets and Apartments. How pleasing is
the Amusement of walking among the Shades and Groves planted by
themselves, in surveying Heroes slain by their Needle, or little Cupids
which they have brought into the World without Pain!</p><p>This is, methinks, the most proper way wherein a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec606.txt')">Lady</a> can shew a fine
Genius, and I cannot forbear wishing, that several Writers of that Sex
had chosen to apply themselves rather to Tapestry than Rhime. Your
Pastoral Poetesses may vent their Fancy in Rural Landskips, and place
despairing Shepherds under silken Willows, or drown them in a Stream of
Mohair. The Heroick Writers may work up Battles as successfully, and
inflame them with Gold or stain them with Crimson. Even those who have
only a Turn to a Song or an Epigram, may put many valuable Stitches into
a Purse, and crowd a thousand Graces into a Pair of Garters.</p><p>If I may, without breach of good Manners, imagine that any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec606.txt')">pretty</a>
Creature is void of Genius, and would perform her Part herein but very
awkardly, I must nevertheless insist upon her working, if it be only to
keep her out of Harm's way.</p><p>Another Argument for busying good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec606.txt')">Women</a> in Works of Fancy, is, because
it takes them off from Scandal, the usual Attendant of Tea-Tables, and
all other unactive Scenes of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec606.txt')">Life</a>. While they are forming their Birds
and Beasts, their Neighbours will be allowed to be the Fathers of their
own Children: And _Whig_ and _Tory_ will be but seldom mentioned, where
the great Dispute is, whether Blue or Red is the more proper Colour. How
much greater Glory would _Sophronia_ do the General, if she would chuse
rather to work the Battle of _Blenheim_ in Tapestry, than signalize her
self with so much Vehemence against those who are _Frenchmen_ in their
Hearts.</p><p>A Third Reason that I shall mention, is the Profit that is brought to
the Family where these pretty Arts are encouraged. It is manifest that
this way of Life not only keeps fair Ladies from running out into
Expences, but is at the same time an actual Improvement. How memorable
would that Matron be, who should have it Inscribed upon her Monument,
'that she Wrought out the whole Bible in Tapestry, and died in a good
old Age, after having covered three hundred Yards of Wall in the
Mansion-House.'</p><p>The Premises being consider'd, I humbly submit the following Proposals
to all Mothers in _Great Britain_.</p><p>I. That no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec606.txt')">young</a> Virgin whatsoever be allow'd to receive the Addresses
of her first Lover, but in a Suit of her own Embroidering.</p><p>II. That before every fresh Servant, she be oblig'd to appear with a
new Stomacher at the least.</p><p>III. That no one be actually <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec606.txt')">married</a>, till she hath the Child-bed
Pillows, &c. ready Stitched, as likewise the Mantle for the Boy quite
finished.</p><p>These Laws, if I mistake not, would effectually restore the decay'd Art
of Needle-work, and make the Virgins of _Great Britain_ exceedingly
Nimble-finger'd in their Business.</p><p>There is a memorable Custom of the _Grecian_ Ladies in this particular,
preserv'd in _<a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec606.txt')">Homer</a>_, which I hope will have a very good Effect with my
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec606.txt')">Country</a>-women. A Widow in Ancient Times could not, without Indecency,
receive a second <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec606.txt')">Husband</a>, till she had Woven a Shrowd for her deceased
Lord, or the next of Kin to him. Accordingly, the Chaste _Penelope_
having, as she thought, lost _Ulysses_ at Sea, she employed her time in
preparing a Winding-sheet for _Laertes_, the Father of her Husband. The
Story of her Web being very Famous, and yet not sufficiently known in
its several Circumstances, I shall give it to my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec606.txt')">Reader</a>, as _Homer_
makes one of her Wooers relate it.</p><p>'<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec606.txt')">Sweet</a> Hope she gave to every Youth apart,
With well-taught Looks, and a deceitful Heart:
A Web she wove of many a slender Twine,
Of curious Texture, and perplext Design;
My Youths, she cry'd, my Lord but newly dead,
Forbear a while to court my widow'd Bed,
'Till I have wov'n, as solemn Vows require,
This Web, a Shrowd for <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec606.txt')">poor</a>_ Ulysses' _Sire.
His Limbs, when Fate the Hero's Soul demands,
Shall claim this Labour of his Daughter's Hands:
Lest all the Dames of Greece my Name despise,
While the great King without a Covering lies.</p><p>Thus she. Nor did my Friends mistrust the Guile.
All Day she sped the long laborious Toil:
But when the burning Lamps supply'd the Sun,
Each Night unravell'd what the Day begun.
Three live-long Summers did the Fraud prevail.
The Fourth her Maidens told th' amazing Tale.
These Eyes beheld, as close I took my Stand,
The backward Labours of her faithless Hand:
'Till watch'd at length, and press'd on every Side,
Her Task she ended, and commenc'd a Bride.'</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Public Mourning for Q. Anne, who died Aug. 1, 1714.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
