<p>No. 608.               Monday, October 18, 1714.           Addison. [1]</p><p></p><p>'--Perjuria ridet Amantum--'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'According to my Promise, I herewith transmit to you a List of several
Persons, who from time to time demanded the _Flitch of Bacon_ of Sir
_Philip de Somervile_ and his Descendants; as it is preserved in an
ancient Manuscript under the Title of _The Register of
Whichenovre-Hall, and of the Bacon Flitch there maintained_.</p><p>'In the Beginning of this Record is recited the Law or Institution in
Form, as it is already printed in your last Paper: To which are added
Two By-Laws, as a Comment upon the General Law, the Substance whereof
is, that the <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec608.txt')">Wife</a> shall take the same Oath as the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec608.txt')">Husband</a>, _mutatis
mutandis_; and that the Judges shall, as they think meet, interrogate
or cross-examine the Witnesses. After this proceeds the Register in
<a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec608.txt')">Manner</a> following.</p><p>'Aubry de Falstaff, _Son of Sir_ John Falstaff, _Kt. with Dame_ Maude
_his Wife, were the first that demanded the Bacon, he having bribed
twain of his Father's Companions to swear falsly in his Behoof whereby
he gained the Flitch: But he and his said Wife falling immediately
into a Dispute how the said Bacon should be dressed, it was by Order
of the Judges taken from him, and hung up again in the Hall._</p><p>'Alison _the Wife of_ Stephen Freckle, _brought her said Husband along
with her, and set forth the good Conditions and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec608.txt')">Behaviour</a> of her
Consort, adding withal that she doubted not but he was ready to attest
the like of her, his Wife; whereupon he, the said_ Stephen, _shaking
his Head, she turned short upon him, and gave him a Box on the Ear_.</p><p>'Philip de Waverland, _having laid his Hand upon the Book, when the
Clause_, Were I sole and she sole, _was rehearsed, found a secret
Compunction rising in his Mind, and stole it off again_.</p><p>'Richard de Loveless, _who was a Courtier, and a very wellbred Man,
being observed to hesitate at the Words_ after our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec608.txt')">Marriage</a>, _was
thereupon required to explain himself. He reply'd, by talking very
largely of his exact Complaisance while he was a Lover; and alledg'd,
that he had not in the least disobliged his Wife for a Year and a Day_
before _Marriage, which he hoped was the same Thing_.</p><p>'Rejected.</p><p>'Joceline Jolly, _Esq., making it appear by unquestionable Testimony,
That he and his Wife had presented full and entire Affection for the
Space of the first Month, commonly called the_ Honey-Moon; _he had in
Consideration thereof one Rasher bestowed upon him_.</p><p>'After this, says the Record, many Years passed over before any
Demandant appeared at _Whichenovre-Hall_; insomuch that one would have
thought that the whole Country were turned _Jews_, so little was their
Affection to the Flitch of Bacon.</p><p>'The next Couple enrolled had like to have carried it, if one of the
Witnesses had not deposed, That dining on a _Sunday_ with the
Demandant, whose Wife had sate below the Squire's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec608.txt')">Lady</a> at Church, she
the said Wife dropped some Expressions, as if she thought her Husband
deserved to be knighted; to which he returned a passionate _Pish_! The
Judges taking the Premises into Consideration, declared the aforesaid
Behaviour to imply an unwarrantable Ambition in the Wife, and Anger in
the Husband.</p><p>'It is recorded as a sufficient Disqualification of a certain Wife,
that speaking of her Husband, she said, _God forgive him_.</p><p>'It is likewise remarkable, that a Couple were rejected upon the
Deposition of one of their Neighbours, that the Lady had once told her
Husband, that _it was her Duty to obey_; to which he replied, _Oh! my
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec608.txt')">Dear</a>, you are never in the wrong_.</p><p>'The violent Passion of one Lady for her Lap-Dog; the turning away of
the old House-Maid by another; a Tavern-Bill torn by the Wife, and a
Taylor's by the Husband; a Quarrel about the Kissing-Crust; spoiling
of Dinners, and coming in late of Nights; are so many several Articles
which occasioned the Reprobation of some Scores of Demandants, whose
Names are recorded in the aforesaid Register.</p><p>'Without enumerating other particular Persons, I shall content my self
with observing, that the Sentence pronounced against one _Gervase
Poacher_ is, that _he might have had Bacon to his Eggs, if he had not
heretofore scolded his Wife when they were over boiled_. And the
Deposition against _Dorothy Dolittle_ runs in these Words; _That she
had so far usuped the Dominion of the Coalfire, (the Stirring whereof
her Husband claimed to himself) that by her good Will she never would
suffer the Poker out of her Hand._</p><p>'I find but two Couples, in this first Century, that were successful:
The first, was a Sea-Captain and his Wife, who since the Day of their
Marriage, had not seen one another till the Day of the Claim. The
Second, was an honest Pair in the Neighbourhood; The Husband was a Man
of plain good Sense, and a peaceable Temper; the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec608.txt')">Woman</a> was dumb.'</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Lord Macaulay, in a letter published p. 1433 ... of Mr.
Bohn's edition of Lowndes's 'Bibliographer's Manual', calls this paper
'undoubtedly Addison's, and one of his best,' although not claimed,
because he could not own it without admitting what Lord Macaulay rightly
considered quite as obvious, his authorship of No. 623. Addison wrote,
evidently, some other of these unappropriated papers.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
