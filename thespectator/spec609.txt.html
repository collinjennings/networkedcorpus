<p>No. 609.               Wednesday, October 20, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Farrago libelli--'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I have for some Time desired to appear in your Paper, and have
therefore chosen a Day [1] to steal into the SPECTATOR, when I take it
for granted you will not have many spare Minutes for Speculations of
your own. As I was the other Day walking with an honest
Country-Gentleman, he very often was expressing his Astonishment to
see the Town so mightily crowded with Doctors of Divinity: Upon which
I told him he was very much mistaken if he took all those Gentlemen he
saw in Scarfs to be Persons of that Dignity; for, that a young Divine,
after his first Degree in the University, usually comes hither only to
show himself; and on that Occasion is apt to think he is but half
equipp'd with a Gown and Cassock for his publick Appearance, if he
hath not the additional Ornament of a Scarf of the first Magnitude to
intitle him to the Appellation of Doctor from his Landlady and the Boy
at _Childs_. Now since I know that this Piece of Garniture is looked
upon as a Mark of Vanity or Affectation, as it is made use of among
some of the little spruce Adventurers of the Town, I should be glad if
you would give it a Place among those Extravagancies you have justly
exposed in several of your Papers: being very well assured that the
main Body of the Clergy, both in the Country and the Universities, who
are almost to a Man untainted with it, would be very well pleased to
see this Venerable Foppery well exposed. When my Patron did me the
<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec609.txt')">Honour</a> to take me into his Family, (for I must own my self of this
Order) he was pleased to say he took me as a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec609.txt')">Friend</a> and Companion; and
whether he looked upon the Scarf like the Lace and Shoulder-knot of a
Footman, as a Badge of Servitude and Dependance, I do not know, but he
was so kind as to leave my wearing of it to my own Discretion; and not
having any just Title to it from my Degrees, I am content to be
without the Ornament. The Privileges of our Nobility to keep a certain
Number of Chaplains are undisputed, though perhaps not one in ten of
those reverend Gentlemen have any Relation to the noble Families their
Scarfs belong to; the Right generally of creating all Chaplains except
the Domestick, where there is one, being nothing more than the
Perquisite of a Steward's Place, who, if he happens to out-live any
considerable Number of his noble Masters, shall probably, at one and
the same Time, have fifty Chaplains, all in their proper
Accoutrements, of his own Creation; though perhaps there hath been
neither Grace nor Prayer said in the Family since the Introduction of
the first Coronet.'</p><p>_I am_, &c.</p><p>
_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I wish you would write a Philosophical Paper about Natural
Antipathies, with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec609.txt')">Word</a> or two concerning the Strength of
Imagination. I can give you a List upon the first Notice, of a
Rational _China_ Cup, of an Egg that walks upon two Legs, and a Quart
Pot that sings like a Nightingale. There is in my Neighbourhood a very
pretty prattling Shoulder of Veal, that squawls out at the Sight of a
Knife. Then as for Natural Antipathies, I know a General Officer who
was never conquered but by a smother'd Rabbit; and a Wife that
domineers over her Husband by the Help of a Breast of Mutton. A Story
that relates to my self on this Subject may be thought not
unentertaining, especially when I assure you that it is literally
true. I had long made Love to a Lady, in the Possession of whom I am
now the happiest of Mankind, whose Hand I shou'd have gained with much
Difficulty without the Assistance of a Cat. You must know then, that
my most dangerous Rival had so strong an Aversion to this Species,
that he infallibly swooned away at the Sight of that harmless
Creature. My Friend Mrs. _Lucy_, her Maid, having a greater <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec609.txt')">Respect</a>
for me and my Purse than she had for my Rival, always took Care to pin
the Tail of a Cat under the Gown of her Mistress, whenever she knew of
his coming; which had such an Effect, that every Time he entred the
Room, he looked more like one of the Figures in Mrs. _Salmon's_
Wax-work, than a desirable Lover. In short, he grew Sick of her
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec609.txt')">Company</a>; which the young Lady taking Notice of, (who no more knew why,
than he did) she sent me a Challenge to meet her in _Lincoln's-Inn_
Chappel, which I joyfully accepted, and have (amongst other Pleasures)
the Satisfaction of being praised by her for my Stratagem, I am, &c.'</p><p>_From the Hoop_.</p><p>Tom. Nimble.</p><p>
_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'The Virgins of _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec609.txt')">Great</a> Britain_ are very much oblig'd to you for
putting them upon such tedious Drudgeries in Needlework as were fit
only for the _Hilpa's_ and the _Nilpa's_ that lived before the Flood.
Here's a stir indeed with your Histories in Embroidery, your Groves
with Shades of Silk and Streams of Mohair! I would have you to know,
that I hope to kill a hundred Lovers before the best Housewife in
_England_ can stitch out a Battel, and do not fear but to provide Boys
and Girls much faster than your Disciples can embroider them. I love
Birds and Beasts as well as you, but am content to fancy them when
they are really made. What do you think of Gilt Leather for Furniture?
There's your pretty Hangings for a Chamber; [2] and what is more, our
own Country is the only Place in _Europe_ where Work of that kind is
tolerably done. Without minding your musty Lessons: I am this Minute
going to _Paul's_ Church-Yard to bespeak a Skreen and a Set of
Hangings; and am resolved to encourage the Manufacture of my Country.'</p><p>_Yours_,</p><p>CLEORA.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Oct. 20, 1714, was the day of the Coronation of George I.]</p><p>

Illi mors gravis incubat,

Ignotus moritur sibi.'</p><p>Seneca.</p><p></p><p>I have often wondered that the _Jews_ should contrive such a worthless
Greatness for the Deliverer whom they expected, as to <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec609.txt')">dress</a> him up in
external Pomp and Pageantry, and represent him to their Imagination, as
making Havock amongst his Creatures, and acted with the poor <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec609.txt')">Ambition</a> of
a _CÃ¦sar_ or an _Alexander_. How much more illustrious doth he appear in
his real Character, when considered as the Author of universal
Benevolence among Men, as refining our Passions, exalting our Nature,
giving us vast Ideas of Immortality, and teaching us a Contempt of that
little showy Grandeur, wherein the _Jews_ made the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec609.txt')">Glory</a> of their
Messiah to consist!</p><p>_Nothing_ (says _Longinus_) _can be Great, the Contempt of which is
Great_. The Possession of Wealth and Riches cannot give a Man a Title to
Greatness, because it is looked upon as a Greatness of Mind, to contemn
these Gifts of Fortune, and to be above the Desire of them. I have
therefore been inclined to think, that there are greater Men who lie
concealed among the Species, than those who come out, and draw upon
themselves the Eyes and Admiration of Mankind. _Virgil_ would never have
been heard of, had not his Domestick Misfortunes driven him out of his
Obscurity, and brought him to _Rome_.</p><p>If we suppose that there are Spirits or Angels who look into the Ways of
Men, as it is highly probable there are, both from Reason and
Revelation; how different are the Notions which they entertain of us,
from those which we are apt to form of one another? Were they to give us
in their Catalogue of such Worthies as are now living, how different
would it be from that, which any of our own Species would draw up?</p><p>We are dazled with the Splendour of Titles, the Ostentation of Learning,
the Noise of Victories; They, on the contrary, see the Philosopher in
the Cottage, who possesses his Soul in Patience and Thankfulness, under
the Pressure of what little Minds <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec609.txt')">call</a> Poverty and Distress. They do not
look for great Men at the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec609.txt')">Head</a> of Armies, or among the Pomps of a Court,
but often find them out in Shades and Solitudes, in the private Walks
and By-paths of Life. The Evening's Walk of a wise Man is more
illustrious in their Sight, than the March of a General at the Head of a
hundred thousand Men. A Contemplation of God's Works; a voluntary Act of
Justice to our own Detriment; a generous Concern for the Good of
Mankind; Tears that are shed in Silence for the Misery of others; a
private Desire or Resentment broken and subdued; in short, an unfeigned
Exercise of Humility, or any other Virtue; are such Actions as are
glorious in their Sight, and denominate Men great and reputable. The
most famous among us are often looked upon with Pity, with Contempt, or
with Indignation; while those who are most obscure among their own
Species, are regarded with Love, with Approbation and Esteem.</p><p>The Moral of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec609.txt')">present</a> Speculation amounts to this, That we should not
be led away by the Censures and Applauses of Men, but consider the
Figure that every Person will make, at that Time when Wisdom shall be
justified of her Children, and nothing pass for Great or Illustrious,
which is not an Ornament and Perfection to humane Nature.</p><p>The Story of _Gyges_ the rich _Lydian_ Monarch, is a memorable Instance
to our present Purpose. The Oracle being asked by _Gyges_, who was the
happiest Man, replied _AglaÂ¸s_. _Gyges_, who expected to have heard
himself named on this Occasion, was much surprized, and very curious to
know who this _AglaÂ¸s_ should be. After much Enquiry he was found to be
an obscure Countryman, who employ'd all his Time in cultivating a
Garden, and a few Acres of Land about his House.</p><p>_Cowley's_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec609.txt')">agreeable</a> Relation of this Story shall close this Day's
Speculation.</p><p>'Thus_ AglaÂ¸s _(a Man unknown to Men,
But the Gods knew, and therefore lov'd him then)
Thus liv'd obscurely then without a Name,_
AglaÂ¸s, _now consign'd t' eternal <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec609.txt')">Fame</a>.
For _Gyges_, the rich King, wicked and great,
Presum'd at wise_ Apollo's Delphick_ Seat,
Presum'd to ask, Oh thou, the whole <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec609.txt')">World</a>'s Eye,
See'st thou a Man that happier is than I?
The God, who scorned to flatter Man, reply'd,
_AglaÂ¸s _happier is. But _Gyges_ cry'd,
In a proud Rage, Who can that_ AglaÂ¸s_ be?
We've heard as yet of no such King as he.
And true it was, through the whole Earth around,
No King of such a Name was to be found.
Is some old _Hero_ of that Name alive,
Who his high Race does from the Gods derive?
Is it some mighty Gen'ral, that has done
Wonders in Fight, and God-like Honours won?
Is it some Man of endless Wealth? said he:
None, none of these; who can this AglaÂ¸s be?
After long Search, and vain Enquiries past,
In an obscure_ Arcadian _Vale at last,
(Th'_ Arcadian _Life has always shady been)
Near_ Sopho's _Town (which he but once had seen)
This_ AglaÂ¸s, _who Monarchs Envy drew,
Whose Happiness the Gods stood Witness to,
This mighty_ AglaÂ¸s _was lab'ring found,
With his own Hands, in his own little Ground.</p><p>So, gracious God, (if it may lawful be,
Among those foolish Gods to mention thee)
So let me act, on such a private Stage,
The last dull Scenes of my declining Age;
After long Toils and Voyages in vain,
This quiet Port let my toss'd Vessel gain;
Of heav'nly Rest, this Earnest to me lend,
Let my Life sleep, and learn to love her End.'</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
