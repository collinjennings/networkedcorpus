<p>No. 611.                  Monday, October 25, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'Perfide! sed duris genuit te cautibus horrens
Caucasus, Hircanæque admórunt ubera tigres.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>I am willing to postpone every thing, to do any the least Service for
the Deserving and Unfortunate. Accordingly I have caused the following
Letter to be inserted in my Paper the Moment that it came to my Hands,
without altering one Tittle in an Account which the <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec611.txt')">Lady</a> relates so
handsomely her self.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I flatter my self, you will not only pity, but, if possible, redress
a Misfortune my self and several others of my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec611.txt')">Sex</a> lie under. I hope
you will not be offended, nor think I mean by this to justifie my own
imprudent Conduct, or expect You should. No! I am sensible how
severely, in some of your former Papers, you have reproved Persons
<a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec611.txt')">guilty</a> of the like Mismanagements. I was scarce Sixteen, and, I may
say without Vanity, Handsome, when courted by a false perjured Man;
who, upon Promise of Marriage, rendered me the most unhappy of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec611.txt')">Women</a>.
After he had deluded me from my Parents, who were <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec611.txt')">People</a> of very good
Fashion, in less than three Months he left me. My Parents would not
see, nor hear from me; and had it not been for a Servant, who had
lived in our Family, I must certainly have perished for want of Bread.
However, it pleased Providence, in a very short time, to alter my
miserable Condition. A Gentleman saw me, liked me, and married me. My
Parents were reconciled; and I might be as happy in the Change of my
Condition, as I was before miserable, but for some things, that you
shall know, which are insupportable to me; and I am sure you have so
much Honour and Compassion as to let those Persons know, in some of
your Papers, how much they are in the wrong. I have been married near
five Years, and do not know that in all that time I ever went abroad
without my Husband's Leave and Approbation. I am obliged, through the
Importunities  of several of my Relations, to go abroad oftner than
suits my Temper. Then it is, I labour under insupportable Agonies.
That Man, or rather Monster, haunts every Place I go to. Base Villain!
By reason I will not admit his nauseous wicked Visits and
Appointments, he strives all the ways he can to ruin me. He left me
destitute of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec611.txt')">Friend</a> or Money, nor ever thought me worth enquiring
after, till he unfortunately happened to see me in a Front Box,
sparkling with Jewels. Then his Passion returned. Then the Hypocrite
pretended to be a Penitent. Then he practised all those Arts that
helped before to undo me. I am not to be deceived a second time by
him. I hate and abhor his odious Passion; and, as he plainly perceives
it, either out of Spight or Diversion, he makes it his Business to
expose me. I never fail seeing him in all publick <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec611.txt')">Company</a>, where he is
always most industriously spightful. He hath, in short, told all his
Acquaintance of our unhappy Affair, they tell theirs; so that it is no
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec611.txt')">Secret</a> among his Companions, which are numerous. They, to whom he
tells it, think they have a Title to be very familiar. If they bow to
me, and I out of good Manners return it, then I am pester'd with
Freedoms that are no ways <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec611.txt')">agreeable</a> to my self or Company. If I turn
my Eyes from them, or seem displeased, they sower upon it, and whisper
the next Person; he his next; 'till I have at last the Eyes of the
whole Company upon me. Nay, they report abominable Falshoods, under
that mistaken Notion, _She that will grant Favours to one Man, will to
a hundred_. I beg you will let those who are guilty, know, how
ungenerous this way of Proceeding is. I am sure he will know himself
the Person aim'd at, and perhaps put a stop to the Insolence of
others. Cursed is the Fate of unhappy Women! that Men may boast and
glory in those things that we must think of with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec611.txt')">Shame</a> and Horror! You
have the Art of making such odious Customs appear detestable. For my
Sake, and I am sure, for the Sake of several others, who dare not own
it, but, like me, lie under the same Misfortunes, make it as infamous
for a Man to boast of Favours, or expose our Sex, as it is to take the
Lie or a Box on the Ear, and not resent it.'
_Your Constant Reader,
and Admirer,_
LESBIA.</p><p>P. S. 'I am the more Impatient under this Misfortune, having receiv'd
fresh Provocation, last Wednesday, in the Abbey.'</p><p>
I entirely agree with the amiable and unfortunate _LESBIA_, that an
Insult upon a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec611.txt')">Woman</a> in her Circumstances, is as infamous in a Man, as a
tame <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec611.txt')">Behaviour</a> when the Lie or a Buffet is given; which Truth, I shall
beg leave of her to illustrate by the following Observation.</p><p>It is a Mark of Cowardice passively to forbear resenting an Affront, the
Resenting of which would lead a Man into Danger; it is no less a Sign of
Cowardice to affront a Creature, that hath not Power to avenge it self.
Whatever Name therefore this ungenerous Man may bestow on the helpless
Lady he hath injur'd, I shall not scruple to give him in return for it,
the Appellation of _Coward_.</p><p>A Man, that can so far descend from his Dignity, as to strike a Lady,
can never recover his Reputation with either Sex, because no Provocation
is thought strong enough to justifie such Treatment from the Powerful
towards the Weak. In the Circumstances, in which poor _LESBIA_ is
situated, she can appeal to no Man whatsoever to avenge an Insult, more
grievous than a Blow. If she could open her Mouth, the base Man knows,
that a Husband, a Brother, a generous Friend would die to see her
righted.</p><p>A generous Mind, however enrag'd against an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec611.txt')">Enemy</a>, feels its Resentments
sink and vanish away, when the Object of its Wrath falls into its Power.
An estranged Friend, filled with Jealousie and Discontent towards a
Bosom-Acquaintance, is apt to overflow with Tenderness and Remorse, when
a Creature, that was once dear to him, undergoes any Misfortune. What
Name then shall we give to his Ingratitude, (who forgetting the Favours
he sollicited with Eagerness, and receiv'd with Rapture) can insult the
Miseries that he himself caused, and make Sport with the Pain to which
he owes his greatest Pleasure? There is but one Being in the Creation
whose Province it is to practise upon the Imbecillities of frail
Creatures, and triumph in the Woes which his own Artifices brought
about; and we well know, those who follow his Example, will receive his
Reward.</p><p>Leaving my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec611.txt')">fair</a> Correspondent to the Direction of her own Wisdom and
Modesty; and her Enemy, and his mean Accomplices, to the Compunction of
their own Hearts; I shall conclude this Paper with a memorable Instance
of Revenge, taken by a _Spanish_ Lady upon a guilty Lover, which may
serve to show what violent Effects are wrought by the most tender
Passion, when sower'd into Hatred; and may deter the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec611.txt')">Young</a> and unwary
from unlawful Love. The Story, however Romantick it may appear, I have
heard affirmed for a Truth.</p><p>Not many Years ago an _English_ Gentleman, who in a Rencounter by Night
in the Streets of _Madrid_ had the Misfortune to kill his Man, fled into
a Church-Porch for Sanctuary. Leaning against the Door, he was surprized
to find it open, and a glimmering Light in the Church. He had the
Courage to advance towards the Light; but was terribly startled at the
sight of a Woman in White who ascended from a Grave with a bloody Knife
in her Hand. The Phantome marched up to him, and asked him what he did
there. He told her the Truth, without reserve, believing that he had met
a Ghost: Upon which, she spoke to him in the following <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec611.txt')">Manner</a>.
'Stranger, thou art in my Power: I am a Murderer as thou art. Know then,
that I am a Nun of a noble Family. A base perjur'd Man undid me, and
boasted of it. I soon had him dispatched; but not content with the
Murder, I have brib'd the Sexton to let me enter his Grave, and have now
pluck'd out his False <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec611.txt')">Heart</a> from his Body; and thus I use a Traitor's
Heart.' At these Words she tore it in Pieces, and trampled it under her
Feet.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
