<p>No. 612.                 Wednesday, October 27, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'Murranum hic atavos et avorum antiqua sonantem
Nomina per regesque actum genus omne Latinos,
Præcipitem scopulo, atque ingentis turbine saxi
Excutit, effunditque solo.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>It is highly laudable to pay <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec612.txt')">Respect</a> to Men who are descended from
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec612.txt')">worthy</a> Ancestors, not only out of Gratitude to those who have done Good
to Mankind, but as it is an Encouragement to others to follow their
Example. But this is an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec612.txt')">Honour</a> to be receiv'd, not demanded, by the
Descendants of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec612.txt')">great</a> Men; and they who are apt to remind us of their
Ancestors, only put us upon making Comparisons to their own
Disadvantage.</p><p>There is some Pretence for boasting of Wit, Beauty, Strength or Wealth,
because the Communication of them may give Pleasure or Profit to others;
but we can have no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec612.txt')">Merit</a>, nor ought we to claim any Respect, because our
Fathers acted well, whether we would or no.</p><p>The following Letter ridicules the Folly I have mentioned, in a new,
and, I think, not disagreeable Light.</p><p>
_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Were the Genealogy of every <a name="topic49" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec612.txt')">Family</a> preserved, there would probably be
no Man valued or despis'd on Account of his Birth. There is scarce a
Beggar in the Streets, who would not find himself lineally descended
from some great Man; nor any one of the highest Title, who would not
discover several base and indigent Persons among his Ancestors. It
would be a pleasant Entertainment to see one Pedigree of Men appear
together, under the same Characters they bore when they acted their
respective Parts among the Living. Suppose therefore a Gentleman, full
of his illustrious Family, should, in the same manner as _Virgil_
makes _Æneas_ look over his Descendants, see the whole Line of his
Progenitors pass in a Review before his Eyes, and with how many
varying Passions would he behold Shepherds and Soldiers, Statesmen and
Artificers, Princes and Beggars, walk in the Procession of five
thousand Years! How would his Heart sink or flutter at the several
Sports of Fortune in a Scene so diversified with Rags and Purple,
Handicraft Tools and Scepters, Ensigns of Dignity and Emblems of
Disgrace; and how would his Fears and Apprehensions, his Transports
and Mortifications, succeed one another, as the Line of his Genealogy
appear'd bright or obscure?</p><p>'In most of the Pedigrees hung up in old Mansion Houses, you are sure
to find the first in the Catalogue a great Statesman, or a Soldier
with an honourable Commission. The Honest Artificer that begot him,
and all his frugal Ancestors before him, are torn off from the Top of
the Register; and you are not left to imagine, that the noble Founder
of the Family ever had a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec612.txt')">Father</a>. Were we to trace many boasted Lines
farther backwards, we should lose them in a Mob of Tradesmen, or a
Crowd of Rusticks, without hope of seeing them emerge again: Not
unlike the old _Appian_ Way, which after having run many Miles in
Length, loses it self in a Bog.</p><p>'I lately made a Visit to an old <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec612.txt')">Country</a> Gentleman, who is very far
gone in this sort of _Family Madness_. I found him in his Study
perusing an old Register of his Family, which he had just then
discover'd, as it was branched out in the Form of a Tree, upon a Skin
of Parchment. Having the Honour to have some of his Blood in my Veins,
he permitted me to cast my Eye over the Boughs of this venerable
Plant; and asked my Advice in the Reforming of some of the superfluous
Branches.</p><p>'We passed slightly over three or four of our immediate Fore-fathers,
whom we knew by Tradition, but were soon stopped by an Alderman of
_London_, who, I perceived, made my Kinsman's Heart go pit-a-pat. His
Confusion increased when he found the Alderman's Father to be a
Grasier; but he recovered his Fright upon seeing _Justice of the
Quorum_ at the end of his Titles. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec612.txt')">Things</a> went on pretty well, as we
threw our Eyes occasionally over the Tree, when unfortunately he
perceived a <a name="topic41" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('41', 'spec612.txt')">Merchant</a>-Tailor perched on a Bough, who was said greatly
to have encreased the Estate; he was just a going to cut him off, if
he had not seen _Gent._ after the Name of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('49', 'spec612.txt')">Son</a>; who was recorded to
have mortgaged one of the Manors his honest Father had purchased. A
Weaver, who was burnt for his Religion in the Reign of Queen _Mary_,
was pruned away without Mercy; as was likewise a Yeoman, who died of a
Fall from his own Cart. But great was our Triumph in one of the Blood
who was beheaded for High-Treason; which nevertheless was not a little
allayed by another of our Ancestors, who was hanged for stealing
Sheep. The Expectations of my good Cousin were wonderfully raised by a
Match into the Family of a Knight, but unfortunately for us this
Branch proved Barren: On the other hand _Margery_ the Milk-maid being
twined <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec612.txt')">round</a> a Bough, it flourished out into so many Shoots, and bent
with so much Fruit, that the old Gentleman was quite out of
Countenance. To comfort me, under this Disgrace, he singled out a
Branch ten times more fruitful than the other, which, he told me, he
valued more than any in the Tree, and bad me be of good Comfort. This
enormous Bough was a Graft out of a _Welsh_ Heiress, with so many
_Ap's_ upon it that it might have made a little Grove by it self. From
the Trunk of the Pedigree, which was chiefly composed of Labourers and
Shepherds, arose a huge Sprout of Farmers; this was branched out into
Yeomen; and ended in a Sheriff of the County, who was Knighted for his
good Service to the Crown, in bringing up an Address. Several of the
Names that seemed to disparage the Family, being looked upon as
Mistakes, were lopped off as rotten or withered; as, on the contrary,
no small Number appearing without any Titles, my Cousin, to supply the
Defects of the Manuscript, added _Esq_; at the End of each of them.</p><p>'This Tree so pruned, dressed, and cultivated, was, within few Days,
transplanted into a large Sheet of Vellum and placed in the great
Hall, where it attracts the Veneration of his Tenants every _Sunday_
Morning, while they wait till his Worship is ready to go to Church;
wondering that a Man who had so many Fathers before him, should not be
made a [Knight,] [1] or at least a Justice of the Peace.'</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Lord,]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
