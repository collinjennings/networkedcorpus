<p>No. 613.               Friday, October 29, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Studiis florentem ignobilis oti--'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>It is reckoned a Piece of Ill-breeding for one Man to engross the whole
Talk to himself. For this Reason, since I keep three Visiting-Days in
the Week, I am content now and then to let my Friends put in a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec613.txt')">Word</a>.
There are several Advantages hereby accruing both to my Readers and my
self. As first, Young and modest Writers have an Opportunity of getting
into Print: Again, The Town enjoys the Pleasure of Variety; and
Posterity will see the Humour of the present Age, by the help of these
little Lights into private and domestick Life. The Benefits I receive
from thence, are such as these: I gain more Time for future
Speculations; pick up Hints which I improve for the publick Good; give
Advice; redress Grievances; and, by leaving commodious Spaces between
the several Letters that I print, furnish out a _Spectator_ with little
Labour and <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec613.txt')">great</a> Ostentation.</p><p>
_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'I was mightily pleased with your Speculation of _Friday_. Your
Sentiments are Noble, and the whole worked up in such a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec613.txt')">manner</a>, as
cannot but strike upon every Reader. But give me leave to make this
Remark: That while you write so Pathetically on Contentment, and a
retired Life, you sooth the Passion of Melancholy, and depress the
Mind from Actions truly Glorious. Titles and Honours are the Reward of
Virtue: We therefore ought to be affected with them: And tho' light
Minds are too much puffed up with exterior Pomp, yet I cannot see why
it is not as truly Philosophical, to admire the glowing Ruby, or the
sparkling Green of an Emerald, as the fainter and less permanent
Beauties of a Rose or a Myrtle. If there are Men of extraordinary
Capacities who lye concealed from the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec613.txt')">World</a>, I should impute it to
them as a Blot in their Character, did not I believe it owing to the
Meanness of their Fortune rather than of their Spirit. _Cowley_, who
tells the Story of _Agla¸s_ with so much Pleasure, was no Stranger to
Courts, nor insensible of Praise.</p><p>'What shall I do to be for ever known,
And make the Age to come my own?'</p><p>was the Result of a laudable <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec613.txt')">Ambition</a>. It was not till after frequent
Disappointments, that he termed himself the Melancholy _Cowley_; and
he praised Solitude, when he despair'd of shining in a Court. The Soul
of Man is an active Principle. He therefore, who withdraws himself
from the Scene before he has play'd his Part, ought to be hissed off
the Stage, and cannot be deemed Virtuous, because he refuses to answer
his End. I must own I am fired with an honest Ambition to imitate
every illustrious Example. The Battles of _Blenheim_ and _Ramillies_
have more than once made me wish my self a Soldier. And when I have
seen those Actions so nobly celebrated by our Poets, I have secretly
aspir'd to be one of that distinguished Class. But in vain I wish, in
vain I pant with the Desire of Action. I am chained down in Obscurity,
and the only Pleasure I can take is in seeing so many brighter
Genius's join their friendly Lights, to add to the Splendor of the
Throne. Farewel then dear _Spec_, and believe me to be with great
Emulation, and no Envy,'</p><p>_Your profess'd Admirer_,</p><p>Will. Hopeless.</p><p>
_Middle-Temple, October_ 26, 1714.</p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>'Tho' you have formerly made _Eloquence_ the Subject of one or more of
your Papers, I do not remember that you ever consider'd it as
possessed by a Set of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec613.txt')">People</a>, who are so far from making
_Quintilian's_ Rules their Practice, that, I dare say for them, they
never heard of such an Author, and yet are no less Masters of it than
_Tully_ or _Demosthenes_ among the Ancients, or whom you please
amongst the Moderns. The Persons I am speaking of are our common
Beggars about this Town; and that what I say is true, I appeal to any
Man who has a Heart one Degree softer than a Stone. As for my part,
who don't pretend to more Humanity than my Neighbours, I have
oftentimes gone from my Chambers with Money in my Pocket, and returned
to them not only Pennyless, but destitute of a Farthing, without
bestowing of it any other way than on these seeming Objects of Pity.
In short, I have seen more Eloquence in a _Look_ from one of these
despicable Creatures, than in the _Eye_ of the fairest _She_ I ever
saw, yet no one is a greater Admirer of that Sex than my self. What I
have to desire of you is, to lay down some Directions in order to
guard against these powerful Orators, or else I know nothing to the
contrary but I must my self be forced to leave the Profession of the
Law, and endeavour to get the Qualifications necessary to that more
profitable one of Begging. But in which soever of these two Capacities
I shine, I shall always desire to be your constant Reader, and ever
will be'</p><p>_Your most humble Servant_,</p><p>J. B.</p><p>
_SIR_,</p><p>'Upon Reading a _Spectator_ last Week, where Mrs. _Fanny Fickle_
submitted the Choice of a Lover for Life to your decisive
Determination, and imagining I might claim the Favour of your Advice
in an Affair of the like, but much more difficult Nature, I called for
Pen and Ink, in order to draw the Characters of Seven Humble Servants,
whom I have equally encouraged for some time. But alas! while I was
reflecting on the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec613.txt')">agreeable</a> Subject, and contriving an advantageous
Description of the dear Person I was most inclined to favour, I
happened to look into my Glass. The sight of the Small-Pox, out of
which I am just recovered, tormented me at once with the loss of my
captivating Arts and my Captives. The Confusion I was in, on this
unhappy, unseasonable Discovery, is inexpressible. Believe me, Sir, I
was so taken up with the Thoughts of your fair Correspondent's Case,
and so intent on my own Design, that I fancied myself as Triumphant in
my Conquests as ever.</p><p>'Now, Sir, finding I was incapacitated to Amuse my self on that
pleasing Subject, I resolved to apply my self to you, or your
Casuistical Agent, for Advice in my present Circumstances. I am
sensible the Tincture of my Skin, and the Regularity of my Features,
which the Malice of my late Illness has altered, are irrecoverable;
yet don't despair, but that Loss, by your Assistance, may in some
measure be reparable, if you'll please to propose a way for the
Recovery of one only of my Fugitives.</p><p>'One of them is in a more particular Manner beholden to me than the
rest; he for some private Reasons being desirous to be a Lover
incognito, always addressed me with _Billet-Doux_, which I was so
careful of in my Sickness, that I secured the Key of my Love-Magazine
under my Head, and hearing a noise of opening a Lock in my Chamber,
indangered my Life by getting out of Bed, to prevent, if it had been
attempted, the Discovery of that Amour.</p><p>'I have formerly made use of all those Artifices, which our Sex daily
practises over yours, to draw, as it were undesignedly, the eyes of a
whole Congregation to my Pew; I have taken a Pride in the number of
Admirers at my Afternoon LevÈe; but am now quite another Creature. I
think, could I regain the attractive Influence I once had, if I had a
Legion of Suitors, I should never be ambitious of Entertaining more
than one. I have almost contracted an Antipathy to the trifling
Discourses of Impertinent Lovers, though I must needs own, I have
thought it very odd of late, to hear Gentlemen, instead of their usual
Complacencies, fall into Disputes before me of Politicks, or else
weary me with the tedious Repetition of how thankful I ought to be,
and satisfied with my Recovery out of so dangerous a Distemper: This,
though I am very sensible of the Blessing, yet I cannot but dislike,
because such Advice from them rather seems to Insult than Comfort me,
and reminds me too much of what I was; which melancholy Consideration
I cannot yet perfectly surmount, but hope your Sentiments on this Head
will make it supportable.</p><p>'To shew you what a Value I have for your Dictates, these are to
certify the Persons concern'd, that unless one of them returns to his
Colours, (if I may so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec613.txt')">call</a> them now) before the Winter is over, I'll
voluntarily confine my self to a Retirement, where I'll punish them
all with my Needle. I'll be reveng'd on them by deciphering them on a
Carpet, humbly begging Admittance, my self scornfully refusing it: If
you disapprove of this, as favouring too much of Malice, be pleased to
acquaint me with a Draught you like better, and it shall be faithfully
performed'</p><p>_By the Unfortunate_</p><p>Monimia.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
