<p>No. 614.                   Monday, November 1, 1712.</p><p></p><p>'Si mihi non animo fixum, immotumque sederet,
Ne cui me vinclo vellem sociare jugali,
Postquam primus amor deceptam morte fefellit;
Si non pertæsum thalami, tedæque fuisset:
Huic uni forsan potui succumbere culpæ.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>The following Account hath been transmitted to me by the <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec614.txt')">Love</a> Casuist.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'Having, in some former Papers, taken Care of the two States of
Virginity and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec614.txt')">Marriage</a>, and being willing that all People should be
served in their Turn; I this Day drew out my Drawer of Widows, where I
met with several Cases, to each whereof I have returned satisfactory
Answers by the Post. The Cases are as follow:</p><p>'_Q._ Whether _Amoret_ be bound by a Promise of Marriage to
_Philander_, made during her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec614.txt')">Husband</a>'s Life?</p><p>'_Q._ Whether _Sempronia_, having faithfully given a Promise to two
several Persons during the last Sickness of her Husband, is not
thereby left at Liberty to chase which of them she pleases, or to
reject them both for the sake of a new Lover?</p><p>'_Cleora_ asks me, Whether she be obliged to continue single,
according to a Vow made to her Husband at the time of his presenting
her with a Diamond Necklace; she being informed by a very pretty young
Fellow of a good Conscience, that such Vows are in their Nature
sinful?</p><p>'Another enquires, Whether she hath not the Right of Widowhood, to
dispose of her self to a Gentleman of great Merit, who presses very
hard; her Husband being irrecoverably gone in a Consumption?</p><p>'An unreasonable Creature hath the Confidence to ask, Whether it be
proper for her to marry a Man who is younger than her eldest Son?</p><p>'A scrupulous well-spoken Matron, who gives me a great many good
Words, only doubts, Whether she is not obliged in Conscience to shut
up her two marriageable Daughters, till such time as she hath
comfortably disposed of her self?</p><p>'_Sophronia_, who seems by her Phrase and Spelling to be a Person of
Condition, sets forth, That whereas she hath a great Estate, and is
but a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec614.txt')">Woman</a>, she desires to be informed, whether she would not do
prudently to marry _Camillus_, a very idle tall young Fellow, who hath
no Fortune of his own, and consequently hath nothing else to do but to
manage hers.'</p><p>
Before I speak of Widows, I cannot but observe one thing, which I do not
know how to account for; a Widow is always more sought after, than an
old Maid of the same Age. It is common enough among ordinary People, for
a stale Virgin to set up a Shop in a Place where she is not known; where
the large Thumb Ring, supposed to be given her by her Husband, quickly
recommends her to some wealthy Neighbour, who takes a Liking to the
jolly Widow, that would have overlooked the venerable Spinster.</p><p>The Truth of it is, if we look into this Sett of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec614.txt')">Women</a>, we find,
according to the different Characters or Circumstances wherein they are
left, that Widows may be divided into those who raise Love, and those
who raise Compassion.</p><p>But not to ramble from this Subject, there are two Things in which
consists chiefly the Glory of a Widow; The Love of her deceased Husband,
and the Care of her Children: To which may be added a third arising out
of the former, Such a prudent Conduct as may do Honour to both.</p><p>A Widow possessed of all these three Qualities, makes not only a
virtuous but a sublime Character.</p><p>There is something so great and so generous in this State of Life, when
it is accompanied with all its Virtues, that it is the Subject of one of
the finest among our modern Tragedies in the Person of _Andromache_; and
hath met with an universal and deserved Applause, when introduced upon
our _English_ Stage by Mr. _Philips_.</p><p>The most memorable Widow in History is Queen _Artemisia_, who not only
erected the famous _Mausoleum_, but drank up the Ashes of her dead Lord;
thereby enclosing them in a nobler Monument than that which she had
built, though deservedly esteemed one of the Wonders of Architecture.</p><p>This last <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec614.txt')">Lady</a> seems to have had a better Title to a second Husband than
any I have read of, since not one Dust of her First was remaining. Our
modern Heroines might think a Husband a very bitter Draught, and would
have good Reason to complain, if they might not accept of a second
Partner, till they had taken such a troublesome Method of losing the
Memory of the first.</p><p>I shall add to these illustrious Examples out of ancient Story, a
remarkable instance of the Delicacy of our Ancestors in Relation to the
State of Widowhood, as I find it recorded in _Cowell's_ Interpreter.
_At_ East _and_ West-Enborne, _in the County of_ Berks, _if a Customary
Tenant die, the Widow shall have what the Law calls her_ Free-Bench _in
all his Copy-hold Lands_, dum sola & casta fuerit; _that is_, while she
lives single and chaste; _but if she commit Incontinency, she forfeits
her Estate: Yet if she will come into the Court riding backward upon a
Black Ram, with his Tail in her Hand, and say the Words following, the
Steward is bound by the Custom to re-admit her to her_ Free-Bench. [1]</p><p>'Here I am,
Riding upon a Black Ram,
Like a Whore as I am;
And, for my_ Crincum Crancum,
_Have lost my_ Bincum Bancum;
And, for my Tail's Game,
Have done this worldly Shame;
Therefore, I pray you Mr. Steward, let me have my Land again.'</p><p>The like Custom there is in the Manor of _Torre_ in _Devonshire_, and
other Parts of the _West_.</p><p>It is not impossible but I may in a little Time present you with a
Register of _Berkshire_ Ladies and other Western Dames, who rode
publickly upon this Occasion; and I hope the Town will be entertained
with a Cavalcade of Widows.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Frank Bank or Free bench are copyhold lands which the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec614.txt')">wife</a>,
being <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec614.txt')">married</a> a spinster, had after her husband's death for dower.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
