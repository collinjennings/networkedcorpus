<p>No. 615.                 Wednesday, November 3, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Qui Deorum
Muneribus sapienter uti,
Duramque callet pauperiem pati,
Pejusque letho flagitium timet:
Non ille pro caris amicis
Aut patriâ timidus perire.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>It must be owned that <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec615.txt')">Fear</a> is a very powerful Passion, since it is
esteemed one of the greatest of Virtues to subdue it. It being implanted
in us for our Preservation, it is no Wonder it sticks close to us, as
long as we have any thing we are willing to preserve. But as Life, and
all its Enjoyments, would be scarce worth the keeping, if we were under
a perpetual Dread of losing them; it is the Business of Religion and
Philosophy to free us from all unnecessary Anxieties, and direct our
Fear to its proper Object.</p><p>If we consider the Painfulness of this Passion, and the violent Effects
it produces, we shall see how dangerous it is to give way to it upon
slight Occasions. Some have frightened themselves into Madness, others
have given up their Lives to these Apprehensions. The Story of a Man who
grew grey in the Space of one Night's Anxiety is very famous;</p><p>'O! Nox, quam longa es, quæ facis una Senem.'</p><p>These Apprehensions, if they proceed from a Consciousness of Guilt, are
the sad Warnings of Reason; and may excite our Pity, but admit of no
Remedy. When the Hand of the Almighty is visibly lifted against the
Impious, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec615.txt')">Heart</a> of mortal Man cannot withstand him. We have this
Passion sublimely represented in the Punishment of the _Egyptians_,
tormented with the Plague of Darkness, in the _Apocryphal_ Book. of
_Wisdom_ ascribed to _Solomon_.</p><p>'For when unrighteous Men thought to oppress the holy Nation; they
being shut up in their Houses, the Prisoners of Darkness, and fetter'd
with the Bonds of a long Night, lay here exiled from the eternal
Providence. For while they supposed to lye hid in their secret Sins,
they were scattered under a dark Veil of Forgetfulness, being horribly
astonished and troubled with strange Apparitions--For Wickedness,
condemned by her own Witness, is very timorous, and being oppressed
with Conscience, always forecasteth grievous <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec615.txt')">things</a>. For Fear is
nothing else but a betraying of the Succours which Reason
offereth--For the whole <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec615.txt')">World</a> shined with clear Light, and none were
hindered in their Labour. Over them only was spread a heavy Night, an
Image of that Darkness which should afterwards receive them; but yet
were they unto themselves more grievous than the Darkness.' [1]</p><p>To Fear, so justly grounded, no Remedy can be proposed; but a Man (who
hath no <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec615.txt')">great</a> Guilt hanging upon his Mind, who walks in the plain Path
of Justice and Integrity, and yet either by natural Complection, or
confirmed Prejudices, or Neglect of serious Reflection, suffers himself
to be moved by this abject and unmanly Passion) would do well to
consider, That there is nothing which deserves his Fear, but that
beneficent Being who is his Friend, his Protector, his Father. Were this
one Thought strongly fixed in the Mind, what Calamity would be dreadful?
What Load can Infamy lay upon us when we are sure of the Approbation of
him, who will repay the Disgrace of a Moment with the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec615.txt')">Glory</a> of Eternity?
What Sharpness is there in Pain and Diseases, when they only hasten us
on to the Pleasures that will never fade? What sting is in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec615.txt')">Death</a>, when
we are assured that it is only the Beginning of Life? A Man who lives
so, as not to fear to die, is inconsistent with himself, if he delivers
himself up to any incidental Anxiety.</p><p>The Intrepidity of a just good Man is so nobly set forth by _Horace_,
that it cannot be too often repeated.</p><p>'The Man resolved and steady to his Trust,
Inflexible to Ill, and obstinately just,
May the rude Rabble's Insolence despise,
Their senseless Clamours and tumultuous Cries;
The Tyrant's Fierceness he beguiles,
And the stern Brow, and the harsh Voice defies,
And with superior Greatness smiles.</p><p>Not the rough Whirlwind, that deforms_
Adria's _black Gulf, and vexes it with Storms,
The stubborn Virtue of his Soul can move;
Not the Red Arm of angry Jove,
That flings the Thunder from the Sky,
And gives it Rage to roar, and Strength to fly.</p><p>Should the whole Frame of Nature round him break,
In Ruin and Confusion hurl'd,
He, unconcerned, would hear the mighty Crack,
And Stand secure amidst a falling World.' [2]</p><p>The Vanity of Fear may be yet farther illustrated, if we reflect,</p><p>_First_, What we fear may not come to pass. No human Scheme can be so
accurately projected, but some little Circumstance intervening may spoil
it. He, who directs the Heart of Man at his Pleasure, and understands
the Thoughts long before, may by ten thousand Accidents, or an immediate
Change in the Inclinations of Men, disconcert the most subtle Project,
and turn it to the Benefit of his own Servants.</p><p>In the next Place we should consider, though the Evil we imagine should
come to pass, it may be much more supportable than it appeared to be. As
there is no prosperous State of Life without its Calamities, so there is
no Adversity without its Benefits, Ask the Great and Powerful, if they
do not feel the Pangs of Envy and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec615.txt')">Ambition</a>. Enquire of the Poor and
Needy, if they have not tasted the Sweets of Quiet and Contentment. Even
under the Pains of Body; the Infidelity of Friends; or the
Misconstructions put upon our laudable Actions, our Minds (when for some
Time accustomed to these Pressures) are sensible of secret Flowings of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec615.txt')">Comfort</a>, the present Reward of a pious Resignation. The Evils of this
Life appear like Rocks and Precipices, rugged and barren at a Distance,
but at our nearer Approach, we find little fruitful Spots, and
refreshing Springs, mixed with the Harshness and Deformities of Nature.</p><p>In the last Place, we may comfort our selves with this Consideration;
that, as the Thing feared may not reach us, so we may not reach what we
fear: Our Lives may not extend to that dreadful Point which we have in
View. He who knows all our Failings, and will not suffer us to be
tempted beyond our Strength, is often pleased in his tender Severity, to
separate the Soul from its Body and Miseries together.</p><p>If we look forward to him for Help, we shall never be in Danger of
falling down those Precipices which our Imagination is apt to create.
Like those who walk upon a Line, if we keep our Eye fixed upon one
Point, we may step forward securely; whereas an imprudent or cowardly
Glance on either Side will infallibly destroy us.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Wisd. xvii. _passim_.]</p><p>
