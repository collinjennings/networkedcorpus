<p>No. 616.                 Friday, November 5, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'Qui bellus homo est, Cotta, pusillus homo est.'</p><p>Martial.</p><p></p><p>_Cicero_ hath observed, that a <a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec616.txt')">Jest</a> is never uttered with a better
Grace, than when it is accompanied with a serious <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec616.txt')">Countenance</a>. When a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec616.txt')">pleasant</a> Thought plays in the Features, before it discovers it self in
<a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec616.txt')">Words</a>, it raises too great an Expectation, and loses the Advantage of
giving Surprize. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec616.txt')">Wit</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec616.txt')">Humour</a> are no less poorly recommended by a
Levity of Phrase, and that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec616.txt')">kind</a> of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec616.txt')">Language</a> which may be distinguished
by the Name of _Cant_. <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec616.txt')">Ridicule</a> is never more strong, than when it is
concealed in Gravity. True Humour lies in the Thought, and arises from
the Representation of Images in odd Circumstances, and uncommon Lights.
A pleasant Thought strikes us by the Force of its natural Beauty; and
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec616.txt')">Mirth</a> of it is generally rather palled, than heightened by that
ridiculous Phraseology, which is so much in <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec616.txt')">Fashion</a> among the Pretenders
to Humour and Pleasantry. This Tribe of Men are like our Mountebanks;
they make a Man a Wit, by putting him in a fantastick Habit.</p><p>Our little Burlesque <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec616.txt')">Authors</a>, who are the Delight of ordinary Readers,
generally abound in these pert Phrases, which have in them more Vivacity
than Wit.</p><p>I lately saw an Instance of this kind of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec616.txt')">Writing</a>, which gave me so
lively an Idea of it, that I could not forbear begging a Copy of the
Letter from the Gentleman who shew'd it to me. It is written by a
Country Wit, upon the Occasion of the Rejoycings on the Day of the
King's Coronation.</p><p>
_Dear_ Jack, (_Past two a Clock and a frosty Morning_.) [1]</p><p>I have just left the Right Worshipful and his Myrmidons about a
Sneaker of Five Gallons. The whole Magistracy was pretty well
disguised before I gave 'em the Slip. Our <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec616.txt')">Friend</a> the Alderman was half
Seas over before the Bonfire was out. We had with us the Attorney, and
two or three other bright Fellows. The Doctor plays least in Sight.</p><p>At Nine a Clock in the Evening we set Fire to the Whore of _Babylon_.
The Devil acted his Part to a Miracle. He has made his Fortune by it.
We equip'd the young Dog with a Tester a-piece. Honest old _Brown_ of
_England_ was very drunk, and showed his Loyalty to the Tune of a
hundred Rockets. The Mob drank the King's Health, on their
Marrow-bones, in Mother _Day's_ Double. They whip'd us half a dozen
Hogsheads. Poor _Tom Tyler_ had like to have been demolished with the
End of a Sky-Rocket, that fell upon the Bridge of his Nose as he was
drinking the King's Health, and spoiled his Tip. The Mob were very
loyal 'till about Midnight, when they grew a little mutinous for more
Liquor. They had like to have dumfounded the Justice; but his Clerk
came in to his Assistance, and took them all down in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec616.txt')">Black</a> and White.</p><p>When I had been huzza'd out of my Seven Senses, I made a Visit to the
Women, who were guzzling very comfortably. Mrs. Mayoress clip'd the
King's _English_. Clack was the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec616.txt')">Word</a>.</p><p>I forgot to tell thee, that every one of the Posse had his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec616.txt')">Hat</a> cocked
with a Distich: The Senators sent us down a Cargo of Ribbon and Metre
for the Occasion.</p><p>Sir _Richard_ to shew his Zeal for the Protestant Religion, is at the
Expence of a Tar-Barrel and a Ball. I peeped into the Knight's great
Hall, and saw a very pretty Bevy of Spinsters. My dear Relict was
amongst them, and ambled in a Country-Dance as notably as the best of
'em.</p><p>May all his Majesty's liege Subjects love him as well as his good
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec616.txt')">People</a> of this his ancient Borough. Adieu.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: (Two in the Morning is the Word, old Boy.)]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
