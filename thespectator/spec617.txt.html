<p>No. 617.                 Monday, November 8, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'Torva Mimalloneis implerunt cornua bombis,
Et raptum vitulo caput ablatura superbo
Bassaris, et lyncem Mænas flexura corymbis,
Evion ingeminat reparabilis adsonat Echo.'</p><p>Persius.</p><p></p><p>There are two Extreams in the Stile of <a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec617.txt')">Humour</a>, one of which consists in
the Use of that little pert Phraseology which I took Notice of in my
last Paper; the other in the Affectation of strained and pompous
Expressions, fetched from the learned Languages. The first savours too
much of the Town; the other of the College.</p><p>As nothing illustrates better than Example, I shall here present my
Reader with a Letter of Pedantick Humour, which was written by a young
Gentleman of the University to his Friend; on the same Occasion, and
from the same Place, as the lively Epistle published in my last
_Spectator_.</p><p>
_Dear Chum_,</p><p>'It is now the third Watch of the Night, the greatest Part of which I
have spent <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec617.txt')">round</a> a capacious Bowl of _China_, filled with the choicest
Products of both the _Indies_. I was placed at a quadrangular Table,
diametrically opposite to the Mace-bearer. The Visage of that
venerable Herald was, according to Custom, most gloriously illuminated
on this joyful occasion. The Mayor and Aldermen, those Pillars of our
Constitution, began to totter; and if any one at the Board could have
so far articulated, as to have demanded intelligibly a Reinforcement
of Liquor, the whole Assembly had been by this time extended under the
Table.</p><p>'The Celebration of this Night's Solemnity was opened by the
Obstreperous Joy of Drummers, who, with their Parchment Thunder, gave
a signal for the Appearance of the Mob under their several Classes and
Denominations. They were quickly joined by the melodious Clank of
Marrow-bone and Cleaver, whilst a Chorus of Bells filled up the
Consort. A Pyramid of Stack-Faggots cheared the Hearts of the Populace
with the Promise of a Blaze: The Guns had no sooner uttered the
Prologue, but the Heavens were brightned with artificial Meteors, and
Stars of our own making; and all the _High-street_ lighted up from one
End to another, with a Galaxy of Candles. We collected a Largess for
the Multitude, who tippled Eleemosynary till they grew exceeding
Vociferous. There was a Paste-board Pontiff with a little swarthy
Dæmon at his Elbow, who, by his diabolical Whispers and Insinuations
tempted his Holiness into the Fire, and then left him to shift for
himself. The Mobile were very sarcastick with their Clubs, and gave
the old Gentleman several Thumps upon his triple Head-piece. _Tom
Tyler's_ Phiz is something damaged by the Fall of a Rocket, which hath
almost spoiled the Gnomon of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec617.txt')">Countenance</a>. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec617.txt')">Mirth</a> of the Commons
grew so very outragious, that it found Work for our Friend of the
_Quorum_, who, by the help of his _Amanuensis_, took down all their
Names and their Crimes, with a Design to produce his Manuscript at the
next Quarter-Sessions, _&c. &c. &c_.</p><p>'I shall subjoin to the foregoing Piece of a Letter, the following
Copy of Verses translated from an Italian Poet, who was the
_Cleveland_ of his Age, and had Multitudes of Admirers. The Subject is
an Accident that happened under the Reign of Pope _Leo_, when a
Firework, that had been prepared upon the Castle of St. _Angelo_,
begun to play before its Time, being kindled by a Flash of Lightning.
The <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec617.txt')">Author</a> hath written his Poem [1] in the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec617.txt')">kind</a> of Style, as
that I have already exemplified in Prose. Every Line in it is a
Riddle, and the Reader must be forced to consider it twice or thrice,
before he will know that the _Cynick's_ Tenement is a _<a name="topic28" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('28', 'spec617.txt')">Tub</a>_, and
_Bacchus_ his Cast-coat a _Hogs-head_, &c.</p><p>' 'Twas Night, and Heav'n, a_ Cyclops, _all the Day,
An Argus now did countless Eyes display;
In ev'ry Window_ Rome _her Joy declares,
All bright, and studded with terrestrial Stars.
A blazing Chain of Lights her Roofs entwines.
And round her Neck the mingled Lustre shines,
The_ Cynick's _rowling Tenement conspires,
With_ Bacchus _his Cast-coat, to feed the Fires.</p><p>The Pile, still big with undiscover'd Shows,
The_ Tuscan _Pile did last its Freight disclose,
Where the proud Tops of_ Rome's _new_ Ætna _rise,
Whence Giants sally, and invade the Skies.</p><p>Whilst now the Multitude expect the Time,
And their tir'd Eyes the lofty Mountain climb,
A thousand Iron Mouths their Voices try,
And thunder out a dreadful Harmony;
In treble Notes the small Artill'ry plays,
The deep-mouth'd Cannon bellows in the Bass.
The lab'ring Pile now heaves; and having giv'n
Proofs of its Travail sighs in Flames to Heav'n.</p><p>The Clouds invelop'd Heav'n from Human Sight,
Quench'd every Star, and put out ev'ry Light;
Now Real Thunder grumbles in the Skies,
And in disdainful Murmurs_ Rome _defies;
Nor doth its answer'd Challenge_ Rome _decline;
But whilst both Parties in full Consort join,
While Heav'n and Earth in Rival Peals resound,
The doubtful Cracks the Hearer's Sense confound;
Whether the Claps of Thunderbolts they hear,
Or else the Burst of Canon wounds their Ear;
Whether Clouds raged by struggling Metals rent,
Or struggling Clouds in_ Roman _Metals pent.
But O, my Muse, the whole Adventure tell,
As ev'ry Accident in order fell.</p><p>Tall Groves of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec617.txt')">Trees</a> the_ Hadrian _Tow'r surround,
Fictitious Trees with Paper Garlands crown'd,
These know no Spring, but when their Bodies sprout
In Fire, and shoot their gilded Blossoms out;
When blazing Leaves appear above their Head,
And into branching Flames their Bodies spread.
Whilst real Thunder splits the Firmament,
And Heav'n's whole Roof in one vast Cleft is rent,
The three-fork'd Tongue amidst the Rupture lolls,
Then drops and on the Airy Turret falls.
The Trees now kindle, and the Garland burns,
And thousand Thunderbolts for one returns.
Brigades of burning Archers upward fly,
Bright Spears and shining Spear-men mount on high,
Flash in the Clouds, and glitter in the Sky.
A Seven-fold Shield of Spheres doth Heav'n defend,
And back again the blunted Weapons send;
Unwillingly they fall, and dropping down,
Pour out their Souls, their sulph'rous Souls, and groan.</p><p>With Joy, great Sir, we viewed this pompous Show,
While Heaven, that sate Spectator still 'till now,
It self turn'd Actor, proud to Pleasure you.
And so 'tis fit, when_ Leo's _fires appear,
That Heav'n it self should turn an Engineer;
That Heav'n it self should all its Wonders show,
And Orbs above consent with Orbs below.'</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Translated from the Latin in Strada's Prolusions.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
