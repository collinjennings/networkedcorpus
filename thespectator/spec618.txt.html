<p>No. 618.              Wednesday, November 10, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Neque enim concludere versum
Dixeris esse satis: neque siquis scribat, uti nos,
Sermoni propiora, putes hunc esse Poetam.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>You having, in your two last _Spectators_, given the Town a couple of
Remarkable Letters, in very different Styles: I take this Opportunity
to offer to you some Remarks upon the _Epistolary_ way of <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec618.txt')">writing</a> in
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec618.txt')">Verse</a>. This is a _Species_ of <a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec618.txt')">Poetry</a> by it self; and has not so much
as been hinted at in any of the Arts of Poetry, that have ever fallen
into my Hands: Neither has it in any Age, or any Nation, been so much
cultivated, as the other several Kinds of Poesie. A Man of _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec618.txt')">Genius</a>_
may, if he pleases, write Letters in Verse upon all <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec618.txt')">manner</a> of
Subjects, that are capable of being embellished with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec618.txt')">Wit</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec618.txt')">Language</a>,
and may render them new and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec618.txt')">agreeable</a> by giving the proper Turn to
them. But in speaking, at present, of _Epistolary Poetry_, I would be
understood to mean only such Writings in this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec618.txt')">Kind</a>, as have been in
Use amongst the Ancients, and have been copied from them by some
Moderns. These may be reduced into two _Classes_: In the one I shall
range Love-Letters, Letters of Friendship, and Letters upon mournful
Occasions: In the other I shall place such Epistles in Verse, as may
properly be called Familiar, Critical, and Moral; to which may be
added Letters of Mirth and Humour. _Ovid_ for the first, and _Horace_
for the Latter, are the best Originals we have left.</p><p>'He that is ambitious of succeeding in the _Ovidian_ way, should first
examine his Heart well, and feel whether his Passions (especially
those of the gentler Kind) play easie, since it is not his Wit, but
the Delicacy and Tenderness of his Sentiments, that will affect his
Readers. His Versification likewise should be soft, and all his
Numbers flowing and querulous.</p><p>'The Qualifications requisite for writing Epistles, after the Model
given us by _Horace_, are of a quite different Nature. He that would
excel in this kind must have a good Fund of strong Masculine Sense: To
this there must be joined a thorough Knowledge of Mankind, together
with an Insight into the Business, and the prevailing Humours of the
Age. Our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec618.txt')">Author</a> must have his Mind well seasoned with the finest
Precepts of Morality, and be filled with nice Reflections upon the
bright and the dark sides of human Life: He must be a Master of
refined Raillery, and understand the Delicacies, as well as the
Absurdities of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec618.txt')">Conversation</a>. He must have a lively Turn of Wit, with
an easie and concise manner of Expression; Every thing he says, must
be in a free and disengaged manner. He must be guilty of nothing that
betrays the Air of a Recluse, but appear a Man of the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec618.txt')">World</a>
throughout. His Illustrations, his Comparisons, and the greatest part
of his Images must be drawn from common Life. Strokes of Satyr and
Criticism, as well as Panegyrick, judiciously thrown in (and as it
were by the by) give a wonderful Life and Ornament to Compositions of
this kind. But let our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec618.txt')">Poet</a>, while he writes Epistles, though never so
familiar, still remember that he writes in Verse, and must for that
reason have a more than ordinary care not to fall into Prose, and a
vulgar Diction, excepting where the Nature and Humour of the Thing
does necessarily require it. In this Point _Horace_ hath been thought
by some Criticks to be sometimes careless, as well as too negligent of
his Versification; of which he seems to have been sensible himself.</p><p>'All I have to add is, that both these Manners of Writing may be made
as entertaining, in their Way, as any other Species of Poetry, if
undertaken by Persons duly qualify'd; and the latter sort may be
managed so as to become in a peculiar manner Instructive. _I am, &ct_.'</p><p>
I shall add an Observation or two to the Remarks of my ingenious
Correspondent, and, in the First place, take Notice, that Subjects of
the most sublime Nature are often treated in the Epistolary way with
Advantage, as in the famous Epistle of _Horace_ to _Augustus_. The Poet
surprizes us with his Pomp, and seems rather betrayed into his Subject,
than to have aimed at it by Design: He appears like the Visit of a King
_Incognito_, with a mixture of Familiarity, and Grandeur. In Works of
this kind, when the Dignity of the Subject hurries the Poet into
Descriptions and Sentiments, seemingly unpremeditated, by a sort of
Inspiration; it is usual for him to recollect himself, and fall back
gracefully into the natural Stile of a Letter.</p><p>I might here mention an Epistolary <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec618.txt')">Poem</a>, just published by Mr. _Eusden_
on the King's Accession to the Throne: Wherein, amongst many other noble
and beautiful Strokes of Poetry, his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec618.txt')">Reader</a> may see this Rule very
happily observed.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
