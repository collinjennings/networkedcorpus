<p>No. 619.               Friday, November 12, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--dura
Exerce imperia, et ramos compesce fluentes.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>I have often thought, that if the several Letters, which are written to
me under the Character of SPECTATOR, and which I have not made use of,
were published in a Volume, they would not be an unentertaining
Collection. The Variety of the Subjects, Styles, Sentiments, and
Informations, which are transmitted to me, would lead a very curious, or
very idle Reader, insensibly along, through a great many Pages. I know
some Authors, who would pick up a _Secret History_ out of such
Materials, and make a Bookseller an Alderman by the Copy. [1] I shall
therefore carefully preserve the Original Papers in a Room set apart for
that Purpose, to the end that they may be of Service to Posterity; but
shall at present content my self, with owning the Receipt of several
Letters, lately come to my Hands, the Authors whereof are impatient for
an Answer.</p><p>_CHARISSA_, whose Letter is dated from _Cornhill_, desires to be eased
in some Scruples relating to the Skill of Astrologers. _Referred to the
Dumb Man for an Answer._</p><p>_J. C_. who proposes a <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec619.txt')">Love</a>-Case, as he calls it, to the Love-Casuist,
is hereby desir'd to <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec619.txt')">speak</a> of it to the Minister of the Parish; it being
a Case of Conscience.</p><p>The poor young Lady, whose Letter is dated _October 26_, who complains
of a harsh Guardian, and an unkind Brother, can only have my good
Wishes, unless she pleases to be more particular.</p><p>The Petition of a certain Gentleman, whose Name I have forgot, famous
for renewing the Curls of decayed Perriwigs, is referred to _the Censor
of small Wares_.</p><p>The Remonstrance of _T. C._ against the Profanation of the Sabbath by
Barbers, Shoe-cleaners, _&c._ had better be offer'd to _the Society of
Reformers_.</p><p>A learned and laborious Treatise upon the Art of Fencing, _returned to
the Author_.</p><p>To the Gentleman of _Oxford_, who desires me to insert a Copy of _Latin_
Verses which were denied a Place in the University Book. Answer.
_Nonumque prematur in annum_.</p><p>To my learned Correspondent who writes against Master's Gowns, and Poke
Sleeves, with a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec619.txt')">Word</a> in Defence of large Scarves. Answer. _I resolve not
to raise Animosities amongst the Clergy_.</p><p>To the Lady, who writes with Rage against one of her own Sex, upon the
Account of Party Warmth. Answer. _Is not the Lady she writes against
reckoned Handsome_?</p><p>I desire _Tom Truelove_, (who sends me a Sonnet upon his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec619.txt')">Mistress</a>, with
a desire to print it immediately) to consider, that it is long since I
was in Love.</p><p>I shall answer a very profound Letter from my old <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec619.txt')">Friend</a> the
Upholsterer, who is still inquisitive whether the King of _Sweden_ be
living or dead, by whispering him in the Ear, _That I believe he is
alive_.</p><p>Let Mr. _Dapperwit_ consider, _What is that long Story of the Cuckoldom
to me_?</p><p>At the earnest Desire of _Monimia's_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec619.txt')">Lover</a>, who declares himself very
penitent, he is recorded in my Paper by the Name of _The Faithful_
Castalio.</p><p>The Petition of _Charles Cocksure_, which the Petitioner styles _very
reasonable--Rejected_.</p><p>The Memorial of _Philander_, which he desires may be dispatched out of
Hand, _Postponed_.</p><p>I desire _S. R._ not to repeat the Expression _under the Sun_ so often
in his next Letter.</p><p>The Letter of _P. S._ who desires either to have it printed entire, or
committed to the Flames. _Not to be printed entire_.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Charles Lillie published, in 1725, 'Original and Genuine
Letters sent 'to the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_ during the time those
Works were publishing, none of which have been before printed.']</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
