<p>No. 621.                 Wednesday, November 17, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--postquam se lumine puro
Implevit, stellasque vagas miratur et Astra
Fixa Polis, vidit quanta sub nocte jaceret
Nostra dies, risitque sui ludibria--'</p><p>Lucan.</p><p></p><p>The following Letter having in it some Observations out of the common
Road, I shall make it the Entertainment of this Day.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'The common Topicks against the Pride of <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec621.txt')">Man</a> which are laboured by
florid and declamatory Writers, are taken from the Baseness of his
Original, the Imperfections of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec621.txt')">Nature</a>, or the short Duration of
those Goods in which he makes his Boast. Though it be true that we can
have nothing in us that ought to raise our Vanity, yet a Consciousness
of our own <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec621.txt')">Merit</a> may be sometimes laudable. The Folly therefore lyes
here: We are apt to pride our selves in worthless, or perhaps shameful
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec621.txt')">Things</a>; and, on the other hand, count that disgraceful which is our
truest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec621.txt')">Glory</a>.</p><p>'Hence it is, that the Lovers of Praise take wrong Measures to attain
it. Would a vain Man consult his own Heart, he would find that if
others knew his Weaknesses as well as he himself doth, he could not
have the Impudence to expect the publick Esteem. Pride therefore flows
from want of Reflection, and Ignorance of our selves. Knowledge and
Humility come upon us together.</p><p>'The proper way to make an Estimate of our selves, is to consider
seriously what it is we value or despise in others. A Man who boasts
of the Goods of Fortune, a gay Dress or a new Title, is generally the
Mark of Ridicule. We ought therefore not to admire in our selves, what
we are so ready to laugh at in other Men.</p><p>'Much less can we with <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec621.txt')">Reason</a> pride our selves in those things, which
at some time of our Life we shall certainly despise. And yet, if we
will give our selves the Trouble of looking backward and forward on
the several Changes, which we have already undergone and hereafter
must try, we shall find that the greater Degrees of our Knowledge and
Wisdom, serve only to shew us our own Imperfections.</p><p>'As we rise from Childhood to Youth, we look with Contempt on the Toys
and Trifles which our Hearts have hitherto been set upon. When, we
advance to Manhood, we are held wise in proportion to our Shame and
Regret for the Rashness and Extravagance of Youth. Old Age fills us
with mortifying Reflections upon a Life, mis-spent in the Pursuit of
anxious Wealth or uncertain <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec621.txt')">Honour</a>. <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec621.txt')">Agreeable</a> to this Gradation of
Thought in this Life, it may be reasonably supposed, that in a future
State, the Wisdom, the Experience, and the Maxims of old Age, will be
looked upon by a separate Spirit in much the same Light, as an ancient
Man now sees the little Follies and Toyings of Infants. The Pomps, the
Honours, the Policies, and Arts of mortal Men, will be thought as
trifling as Hobby-Horses, Mock Battles, or any other Sports that now
employ all the Cunning, and Strength, and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec621.txt')">Ambition</a> of rational Beings
from four Years old to nine or ten.</p><p>'If the Notion of a gradual Rise in Beings, from the meanest to the
most High, be not a vain Imagination, it is not improbable that an
Angel looks down upon a Man, as a Man doth upon a Creature which
approaches the nearest to the rational Nature. By the same Rule (if I
may indulge my Fancy in this Particular) a superior Brute looks with a
kind of Pride on one of an inferior Species. If they could reflect, we
might imagine from the Gestures of some of them, that they think
themselves the Sovereigns of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec621.txt')">World</a>, and that all things were made
for them. Such a Thought would not be more absurd in Brute <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec621.txt')">Creatures</a>,
than one which Men are apt to entertain, namely, That all the Stars in
the Firmament were created only to please their Eyes and amuse their
Imaginations. Mr. _Dryden_, in his Fable of the _Cock and the Fox_,
makes a Speech for his Hero the Cock, which is a pretty Instance for
this Purpose,</p><p>'Then turning, said to_ Partlet, _See, my Dear,
How lavish Nature hath adorn'd the Year;
How the pale Primrose and the Violet spring,
And Birds essay their Throats, disus'd to sing:
All these are ours, and I with Pleasure see
Man strutting on two Legs, and aping me.'</p><p>'What I would observe from the Whole is this, That we ought to value
our selves upon those Things only which superior Beings think
valuable, since that is the only way for us not to sink in our own
Esteem hereafter.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
