<p>No. 623.            Monday, November 22, 1714.             Addison [1].</p><p></p><p>'Sed mihi vel tellus optem prius ima dehiscat,

Curious Piece of Antiquity, which I shall communicate to the Publick in
his own Words.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'You may remember, that I lately transmitted to you an Account of an
ancient Custom, in the Manors of East _and_ West-Enborne, _in the
County of_ Berks, _and elsewhere. If a Customary Tenant die, the Widow
shall have what the Law calls her_ Free-Bench _in all his Copyhold
Lands_, dum sola et casta fuerit, _that is_, while she lives single
and chaste; _but if she commits Incontinency, she forfeits her Estate;
Yet if she will come into the Court riding backward upon a Black Ram,
with his Tail in her Hand, and say the Words following, the Steward is
bound by the Custom to re-admit her to her_ Free-Bench.</p><p>'Here I am,
Riding upon a Black Ram,
Like a Whore as I am;
And, for my_ Crincum Crancum,
_Have lost my_ Bincum Bancum;
_And, for my Tail's Game,
Have done this worldly Shame;
Therefore, I pray you Mr. Steward, let me have my Land again.'</p><p>'After having informed you that my Lord _Coke_ observes, that this is
the most frail and slippery Tenure of any in _England_, I shall tell
you, since the Writing of that Letter, I have, according to my
Promise, been at great Pains in searching out the Records of the
_Black Ram_; and have at last met with the Proceedings of the
Court-Baron, held in that Behalf, for the Space of a whole Day. The
Record saith, that a strict Inquisition having been made into the
Right of the Tenants to their several Estates, by a crafty old
Steward, he found that many of the Lands of the Manor were, by default
of the several Widows, forfeited to the Lord, and accordingly would
have enter'd on the Premises: Upon which the good <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec623.txt')">Women</a> demanded the
Benefit of the Ram. The Steward, after having perused their several
Pleas, adjourn'd the Court to _Barnaby-bright_ [3], that they might
have Day enough before them.</p><p>'The Court being set, and filled with a great Concourse of People, who
came from all Parts to see the Solemnity, the first who entered was
the Widow _Frontly_, who had made her Appearance in the last Year's
Cavalcade. The Register observes, that finding it an easy Pad-Ram, and
foreseeing she might have further Occasion for it, she purchased it of
the Steward.</p><p>'Mrs. _Sarah Dainty_, Relict of Mr. _John Dainty_, (who was the
greatest Prude in the Parish) came next in the Procession. She at
first made some Difficulty of taking the Tail in her Hand; and was
observed in pronouncing the Form of Penance, to soften the two most
emphatical Words into _Clincum Clancum_: But the Steward took care to
make her speak plain _English_ before he would _let her have her Land
again_.</p><p>'The third Widow that was _brought to this worldly Shame_, being
mounted upon a vicious Ram, had the Misfortune to be thrown by him;
upon which she hoped to be excused from going thro' the rest of the
Ceremony: But the Steward being well versed in the Law, observed very
wisely upon this Occasion, that the breaking of the Rope does not
hinder the Execution of the Criminal.</p><p>'The fourth <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec623.txt')">Lady</a> upon Record was the Widow _Ogle_, a famous Coquette,
who had kept half a Score young Fellows off and on for the Space of
two Years; but having been more kind to her Carter _John_, she was
introduced with the Huzza's of all her Lovers about her.</p><p>'Mrs. _Sable_ appearing in her Weeds, which were very new and fresh,
and of the same Colour with her whimsical _Palfrey_, made a very
decent Figure in the Solemnity.</p><p>'Another, who had been summoned to make her Appearance, was excused by
the Steward, as well knowing in his Heart, that the good Squire
himself had qualified her for the Ram.</p><p>'Mrs. _Quick_ having nothing to object against the Indictment, pleaded
her Belly. But it was remembred that she made the same Excuse the Year
before. Upon which the Steward observ'd, that she might so contrive
it, as never to do the Service of the Manor.</p><p>'The Widow _Fidget_ being cited into Court, insisted that she had done
no more since the Death of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec623.txt')">Husband</a>, than what she used to do in
his Life-time; and withal desir'd Mr. Steward to consider his own
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec623.txt')">Wife</a>'s Case, if he should chance to die before her.</p><p>'The next in order was a Dowager of a very corpulent Make, who would
have been excused as not finding any Ram that was able to carry her;
upon which the Steward commuted her Punishment, and ordered her to
make her Entry upon a black Ox.</p><p>'The Widow _Maskwell_, a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec623.txt')">Woman</a> who had long lived with a most
unblemished Character, having turned off her old Chamber-maid in a
Pet, was by that revengeful Creature brought in upon the black Ram
Nine times the same Day.</p><p>'Several Widows of the Neighbourhood, being brought upon their Tryal,
they shewed that they did not hold of the Manor, and were discharged
accordingly.</p><p>'A pretty young Creature who closed the Procession, came ambling in,
with so bewitching an Air, that the Steward was observ'd to cast a
Sheep's Eye upon her, and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec623.txt')">married</a> her within a Month after the Death
of his Wife.</p><p>'_N. B._ Mrs. _Touchwood_ appeared, according to Summons, but had
nothing laid to her Charge; having liv'd irreproachably since the
Decease of her Husband, who left her a Widow in the Sixty-ninth Year
of her Age.'</p><p>_I am, SIR_, &c.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: See note to No. 608.]</p><p>
