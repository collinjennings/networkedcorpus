<p>No. 624.                 Wednesday, November 24, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'Audire, atque togam jubeo componere, quisquis
Ambitione mala, aut argenti pallet amore
Quisquis luxuria--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Mankind is divided into two Parts, the Busie and the Idle. The Busie
<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec624.txt')">World</a> may be divided into the <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec624.txt')">Virtuous</a> and the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec624.txt')">Vicious</a>. The Vicious
again into the Covetous, the Ambitious, and the Sensual. The idle Part
of Mankind are in a State inferior to any one of these. All the other
are engaged in the Pursuit of Happiness, though often misplaced, and are
therefore more likely to be attentive to such Means, as shall be
proposed to them for that End. The Idle, who are neither wise for this
World, nor the next, are emphatically called by Dr. _Tillotson_, _Fools
at large_. They propose to themselves no End, but run adrift with every
Wind. Advice therefore would be but thrown away upon them, since they
would scarce take the Pains to read it. I shall not fatigue any of this
worthless Tribe with a long Harangue; but will leave them with this
short Saying of _Plato_, that _Labour is preferable to Idleness, as
Brightness to Rust_.</p><p>The Pursuits of the Active Part of Mankind, are either in the Paths of
Religion and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec624.txt')">Virtue</a>; or, on the other Hand, in the Roads to <a name="topic14" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec624.txt')">Wealth</a>,
Honours or Pleasure. I shall therefore compare the Pursuits of Avarice,
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec624.txt')">Ambition</a> and sensual Delight, with their opposite <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec624.txt')">Virtues</a>; and shall
consider which of these Principles engages Men in a Course of the
greatest Labour, Suffering and Assiduity. Most Men, in their cool
Reasonings, are willing to allow that a Course of Virtue will in the End
be rewarded the most amply; but represent the Way to it as rugged and
narrow. If therefore it can be made appear, that Men struggle through as
many Troubles to be miserable, as they do to be happy, my Readers may
perhaps be perswaded to be Good, when they find they shall lose nothing
by it.</p><p>_First_, for Avarice. The Miser is more Industrious than the Saint: The
Pains of getting, the Fears of losing, and the Inability of enjoying his
Wealth, have been the Mark of Satyr in all Ages. Were his Repentance
upon his Neglect of a good Bargain, his <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec624.txt')">Sorrow</a> for being over-reached,
his Hope of improving a Sum, and his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec624.txt')">Fear</a> of falling into Want, directed
to their proper Objects; they would make so many different _Christian_
Graces and Virtues. He may apply to himself a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec624.txt')">great</a> Part of St. _Paul's_
Catalogue of Sufferings. _In journeying often; in Perils of Water, in
Perils of Robbers, in Perils among false Brethren. In Weariness and
Painfulness, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thirst, in Fastings
often_,--At how much less Expence might he _lay up to himself Treasures
in Heaven_; or if I may, in this Place, be allowed to add the Saying of
a great Philosopher, he may _provide such Possessions, as fear neither
Arms, nor Men, nor_ Jove _himself_.</p><p>In the second Place, if we look upon the Toils of Ambition, in the same
Light as we have considered those of Avarice, we shall readily own that
far less Trouble is requisite to gain lasting <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec624.txt')">Glory</a>, than the Power and
Reputation of a few Years; or, in other <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec624.txt')">Words</a>, we may with more Ease
deserve <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec624.txt')">Honour</a>, than obtain it. The Ambitious Man should remember
Cardinal _Woolsey's_ Complaint.</p><p>'Had I served God, with the same Application, wherewith I served my
King, he would not have forsaken me in my old Age.'</p><p>The Cardinal here softens his Ambition by the specious Pretence of
_serving his King_: Whereas his Words in the proper Construction, imply,
that if instead of being acted by Ambition, he had been acted by
Religion, he should have now felt the Comforts of it, when the whole
World turned its Back upon him.</p><p>_Thirdly,_ Let us compare the Pains of the Sensual, with those of the
Virtuous, and see which are heavier in the Balance. It may seem strange,
at the first View, that the Men of Pleasure should be advised to change
their Course, because they lead a painful <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('14', 'spec624.txt')">Life</a>. Yet when we see them so
active and vigilant in quest of Delight; under so many Disquiets, and
the Sport of such various <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec624.txt')">Passions</a>; let them answer, as they can, if the
Pains they undergo, do not outweigh their Enjoyments. The Infidelities
on the one Part between the two Sexes, and the Caprices on the other,
the Debasement of Reason, the Pangs of Expectation, the Disappointments
in Possession, the Stings of Remorse, the Vanities and Vexations
attending even the most refined Delights that make up this Business of
Life, render it so silly and uncomfortable, that no Man is thought wise
till he hath got over it, or happy, but in proportion as he hath cleared
himself from it.</p><p>The Sum of all is this. Man is made an active Being. Whether he walks in
the Paths of Virtue or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec624.txt')">Vice</a>, he is sure to meet with many Difficulties
to prove his Patience, and excite his Industry. The same if not greater
Labour, is required in the Service of Vice and Folly, as of Virtue and
Wisdom: And he hath this easie Choice left him, whether with the
Strength he is Master of, he will purchase Happiness or Repentance.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
