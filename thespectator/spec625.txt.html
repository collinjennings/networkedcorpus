<p>No. 625.                 Friday, November 26, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--amores
A tenero meditatur Ungui--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>The _<a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec625.txt')">Love</a> Casuist_ hath referred to me the following Letter of Queries,
with his Answers to each Question, for my Approbation. I have
accordingly consider'd the several Matters therein contained, and hereby
confirm and ratifie his Answers, and require the gentle Querist to
conform her self thereunto.</p><p>_SIR_,</p><p>'I was Thirteen the Ninth of November last, and must now begin to
think of settling my self in the World, and so I would humbly beg your
Advice, what I must do with Mr. _Fondle_, who makes his Addresses to
me. He is a very pretty Man, and hath the blackest Eyes and whitest
Teeth you ever saw. Though he is but a younger Brother, he dresses
like a Man of Quality, and no Body comes into a Room like him. I know
he hath refused great Offers, and if he cannot Marry me, he will never
have any Body else. But my Father hath forbid him the House, because
he sent me a Copy of Verses; for he is one of the greatest Wits in
Town. My eldest Sister, who, with her good Will, would <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec625.txt')">call</a> me _Miss_
as long as I live, must be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec625.txt')">married</a> before me, they say. She tells
them, that Mr. _Fondle_ makes a Fool of me, and will spoil the Child,
as she calls me, like a confident thing as she is. In short, I am
resolved to marry Mr. _Fondle_, if it be but to spite her. But because
I would do nothing that is imprudent, I beg of you to give me your
Answers to some Questions I will write down, and desire you to get
them printed in the SPECTATOR, and I do not doubt but you will give
such Advice, as, I am sure, I shall follow.</p><p>'When Mr. _Fondle_ looks upon me for half an Hour together, and calls
me _Angel_, is he not in Love?</p><p>Answer, No.</p><p>'May not I be certain he will be a kind <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec625.txt')">Husband</a>, that has promised me
half my Portion in Pin-money, and to keep me a Coach and Six in the
Bargain.</p><p>No.</p><p>'Whether I, who have been acquainted with him this whole Year almost,
am not a better Judge of his Merit, than my Father and Mother, who
never heard him talk, but at Table?</p><p>No.</p><p>'Whether I am not old enough to chuse for my self?</p><p>No.</p><p>'Whether it would not have been rude in me to refuse a Lock of his
Hair?</p><p>No.</p><p>'Shou'd not I be a very barbarous Creature, if I did not pity a Man
that is always Sighing for my Sake?</p><p>No.</p><p>'Whether you would not advise me to run away with the poor Man?</p><p>No.</p><p>'Whether you do not think, that if I won't have him, he won't drown
himself?</p><p>No.</p><p>What shall I say to him the next time he asks me if I will marry him?</p><p>No.</p><p>
The following Letter requires neither Introduction, nor Answer.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>I wonder that in the present Situation of Affairs, you can take
Pleasure in writing any thing but News; for, in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec625.txt')">Word</a>, who minds any
thing else? The Pleasure of increasing in Knowledge, and learning
something new every Hour of Life, is the noblest Entertainment of a
Rational Creature. I have a very good Ear for a Secret, and am
naturally of a communicative Temper; by which Means I am capable of
doing you great Services in this way. In order to make my self useful,
I am early in the Antichamber, where I thrust my Head into the thick
of the Press, and catch the News, at the opening of the Door, while it
is warm. Sometimes I stand by the Beef-Eaters, and take the Buz as it
passes by me. At other times I lay my Ear close to the Wall, and suck
in many a valuable Whisper, as it runs in a streight Line from Corner
to Corner. When I am weary with standing, I repair to one of the
neighbouring Coffee-houses, where I sit sometimes for a whole Day, and
have the News as it comes from Court fresh and fresh. In short, Sir, I
spare no Pains to know how the World goes. A Piece of News loses its
Flavour when it hath been an Hour in the Air. I love, if I may so
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec625.txt')">speak</a>, to have it fresh from the Tree; and to convey it to my Friends
before it is faded. Accordingly my Expences in Coach-hire make no
small Article; which you may believe, when I assure you, that I post
away from Coffee-house to Coffee-house, and forestall the
_Evening-Post_ by two Hours. There is a certain Gentleman who hath
given me the slip twice or thrice, and hath been beforehand with me at
_Child's_. But I have play'd him a Trick. I have purchas'd a pair of
the best Coach-horses I could buy for Money, and now let him out-strip
me if he can. Once more, Mr. SPECTATOR, let me advise you to deal in
News. You may depend upon my Assistance. But I must break off
abruptly, for I have twenty Letters to write.</p><p>_Yours in haste_,
Tho. Quid-nunc.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
