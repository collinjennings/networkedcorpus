<p>No. 626.              Monday, November 29, 1714.           Henry Grove.</p><p></p><p>'--Dulcique animos novitate tenebo--'</p><p>Ov. Met. 1. I.</p><p></p><p>I have seen a little Work of a learned <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec626.txt')">Man</a>, [1] consisting of
extemporary Speculations, which owed their Birth to the most trifling
Occurrences of Life. His usual Method was, to write down any sudden
Start of Thought which arose in his Mind upon the sight of an odd
Gesticulation in a Man, any whimsical Mimickry of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec626.txt')">Reason</a> in a Beast, or
whatever appeared remarkable in any Object of the visible Creation. He
was able to moralize upon a Snuff-Box, would flourish eloquently upon a
Tucker or a Pair of Ruffles, and draw practical Inferences from a
full-bottomed Perriwig. This I thought fit to mention, by way of Excuse,
for my ingenious Correspondent, who hath introduced the following Letter
by an Image which, I will beg leave to tell him, is too ridiculous in so
serious and noble a Speculation.</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'When I have seen young Puss playing her wanton Gambols, and with a
thousand antick Shapes express her own Gayety at the same time that
she moved mine, while the old Grannum hath sat by with a most
exemplary Gravity, unmov'd at all that past; it hath made me reflect
what should be the occasion of Humours so opposite in two <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec626.txt')">Creatures</a>,
between whom there was no visible Difference but that of Age; and I
have been able to resolve it into nothing else but _the Force of
Novelty_.</p><p>'In every Species of Creatures, those who have been least Time in the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec626.txt')">World</a>, appear best pleased with their Condition: For, besides that to
a new Comer the World hath a Freshness on it that strikes the Sense
after a most <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec626.txt')">agreeable</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec626.txt')">Manner</a>, _Being_ it self, unattended with any
<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec626.txt')">great</a> Variety of Enjoyments, excites a Sensation of Pleasure. But as
Age advances, every thing seems to wither, the Senses are disgusted
with their old Entertainments, and Existence turns flat and insipid.
We may see this exemplified in Mankind: The Child, let him be free
from Pain, and gratified in his Change of Toys, is diverted with the
smallest Trifle. Nothing disturbs the Mirth of the Boy, but a little
Punishment or Confinement. The Youth must have more violent Pleasures
to employ his Time; the Man loves the Hurry of an active Life, devoted
to the Pursuits of Wealth or <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec626.txt')">Ambition</a>; and Lastly, old Age, having
lost its Capacity for these Avocations, becomes its own insupportable
Burthen. This Variety may in part be accounted for by the Vivacity and
Decay of the Faculties; but I believe is chiefly owing to this, That
the longer we have been in Possession of Being, the less sensible is
the Gust we have of it; and the more it requires of adventitious
Amusements to relieve us from the Satiety and Weariness it brings
along with it.</p><p>'And as Novelty is of a very powerful, so of a most extensive
influence. Moralists have long since observed it to be the Source of
Admiration, which lessens in proportion to our Familiarity with
Objects, and upon a thorough Acquaintance is utterly extinguished. But
I think it hath not been so commonly remarked, that all the other
Passions depend considerably on the same Circumstance. What is it but
Novelty that awakens Desire, enhances Delight, kindles Anger, provokes
Envy, inspires Horror? To this Cause we must ascribe it, that Love
languishes with Fruition, and Friendship it self is recommended by
Intervals of Absence: Hence Monsters, by use, are beheld without
loathing, and the most enchanting Beauty without Rapture. That Emotion
of the Spirits in which Passion consists, is usually the Effect of
Surprize, and as long as it continues, heightens the agreeable or
disagreeable Qualities of its Object; but as this Emotion ceases (and
it ceases with the Novelty) <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec626.txt')">things</a> appear in another Light, and
affects us even less than might be expected from their proper Energy,
for having moved us too much before.</p><p>'It may not be an useless Enquiry how far the Love of Novelty is the
unavoidable Growth of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec626.txt')">Nature</a>, and in what Respects it is peculiarly
adapted to the present State. To me it seems impossible, that a
reasonable Creature should rest absolutely satisfied in any
Acquisitions whatever, without endeavouring farther; for after its
highest Improvements, the Mind hath an Idea of an Infinity of things
still behind worth knowing, to the Knowledge of which therefore it
cannot be indifferent; as by climbing up a Hill in the midst of a wide
Plain, a Man hath his Prospect enlarged, and, together with that, the
Bounds of his Desires. Upon this Account, I cannot think he detracts
from the State of the Blessed, who conceives them to be perpetually
employed in fresh Searches into Nature, and to Eternity advancing into
the fathomless Depths of the Divine Perfections. In this Thought there
is nothing but what doth <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec626.txt')">Honour</a> to these glorified Spirits; provided
still it be remembred, that their Desire of more proceeds not from
their disrelishing what they possess; and the Pleasure of a new
Enjoyment is not with them measured by its Novelty (which is a thing
merely foreign and accidental) but by its real intrinsick Value. After
an Acquaintance of many thousand Years with the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec626.txt')">Works</a> of God, the
Beauty and Magnificence of the Creation fills them with the same
pleasing Wonder and profound Awe, which _Adam_ felt himself seized
with as he first opened his Eyes upon this glorious Scene. Truth
captivates with unborrowed Charms, and whatever hath once given
Satisfaction will always do it: In all which they have manifestly the
Advantage of us, who are so much govern'd by sickly and changeable
Appetites, that we can with the greatest Coldness behold the
stupendous Displays of Omnipotence, and be in Transports at the puny
Essays of humane Skill; throw aside Speculations of the sublimest
Nature and vastest Importance into some obscure Corner of the Mind, to
make Room for new Notions of no Consequence at all; are even tired of
Health, because not enlivened with alternate Pain, and prefer the
first Reading of an indifferent Author, to the second or third Perusal
of one whose <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec626.txt')">Merit</a> and Reputation are established.</p><p>Our being thus formed serves many useful Purposes in the present
State. It contributes not a little to the Advancement of Learning;
for, as _Cicero_ takes Notice, That which makes Men willing to undergo
the Fatigues of Philosophical Disquisitions, is not so much the
Greatness of Objects as their Novelty. It is not enough that there is
Field and Game for the Chace, and that the Understanding is prompted
with a restless Thirst of Knowledge, effectually to rouse the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec626.txt')">Soul</a>,
sunk into the State of Sloth and Indolence; it is also necessary that
there be an uncommon Pleasure annexed to the first Appearance of Truth
in the Mind. This Pleasure being exquisite for the Time it lasts, but
transient, it hereby comes to pass that the Mind grows into an
Indifference to its former Notions, and passes on after new
Discoveries, in hope of repeating the Delight. It is with Knowledge as
with Wealth, the Pleasure of which lies more in making endless
Additions, than in taking a Review of our old Store. There are some
Inconveniencies that follow this Temper, if not guarded against,
particularly this, that through a too great Eagerness of something new
we are many times impatient of staying long enough upon a Question
that requires some time to resolve it, or, which is worse, perswade
our selves that we are Masters of the Subject before we are so, only
to be at the Liberty of going upon a fresh Scent; in Mr. _Lock's_
Words, _We see a little, presume a great deal, and so jump to the
Conclusion_.</p><p>'A farther Advantage of our Inclination for Novelty, as at present
circumstantiated, is, that it annihilates all the boasted Distinctions
among Mankind. Look not up with Envy to those above thee. Sounding
Titles, stately Buildings, fine Gardens, gilded Chariots, rich
Equipages, what are they? They dazzle every one but the Possessor: To
him that is accustomed to them they are cheap and regardless Things:
They supply him not with brighter Images, or more sublime
Satisfactions than the plain Man may have, whose small Estate will
just enable him to support the Charge of a simple unencumbered Life.
He enters heedless into his Rooms of State, as you or I do under our
poor Sheds. The noble Paintings and costly Furniture are lost on him;
he sees them not: As how can it be otherwise, when by Custom, a
Fabrick infinitely more grand and finish'd, that of the Universe,
stands unobserved by the Inhabitants, and the everlasting Lamps of
Heaven are lighted up in vain, for any Notice that Mortals take of
them? Thanks to indulgent Nature, which not only placed her Children
originally upon a Level, but still, by the Strength of this Principle,
in a great Measure preserves it, in spite of all the Care of a Man, to
introduce artificial Distinctions.</p><p>'To add no more, Is not this Fondness for Novelty, which makes us out
of Conceit with all we already have, a convincing Proof of a future
State? Either Man was made in vain, or this is not the only World he
was made for: For there cannot be a greater Instance of Vanity, than
that to which Man is liable, to be deluded from the Cradle to the
Grave with fleeting Shadows of Happiness. His Pleasures, and those not
considerable neither, die in the Possession, and fresh Enjoyments do
not rise fast enough to fill up half his Life with Satisfaction. When
I see Persons sick of themselves any longer than they are called away
by something that is of Force to chain down the present Thought; when
I see them hurry from Country to Town, and then from the Town back
again into the Country, continually shifting Postures, and placing
Life in all the different Lights they can think of; _Surely_, say I to
my self, _Life is vain, and the Man beyond Expression stupid or
prejudic'd, who from the Vanity of Life cannot gather, He is designed
for Immortality_.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Meditations, &c, by the Hon. Robert Boyle.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
