<p>No. 629.                   Monday, December 6, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'Experiar quid concedatur in illos,
Quorum Flaminia tegitur cinis atque Latin√¢.'</p><p>Juv.</p><p></p><p>Next to the People who want a Place, there are none to be pitied more
than those who are solicited for one. A plain Answer, with a Denial in
it, is looked upon as Pride, and a civil Answer as a Promise.</p><p>Nothing is more ridiculous than the Pretensions of People upon these
Occasions. Every thing a Man hath suffered, whilst his Enemies were in
play, was certainly brought about by the Malice of the opposite Party. A
bad Cause would not have been lost, if such an one had not been upon the
Bench; nor a profligate Youth disinherited, if he had not got drunk
every Night by toasting an outed Ministry. I remember a Tory, who having
been fined in a <a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec629.txt')">Court</a> of Justice for a Prank that deserved the Pillory,
desir'd upon the Merit of it to be made a Justice of Peace when his
Friends came into Power; and shall never forget a Whig Criminal, who,
upon being indicted for a Rape, told his Friends, _You see what a Man
suffers for sticking to his Principles_.</p><p>The Truth of it is, the Sufferings of a Man in a Party are of a very
doubtful Nature. When they are such as have promoted a good Cause, and
fallen upon a Man undeservedly, they have a Right to be heard and
recompensed beyond any other Pretensions. But when they rise out of
Rashness or Indiscretion, and the Pursuit of such Measures as have
rather ruined, than promoted the Interest they aim at, (which hath
always been the Case of many great Sufferers) they only serve to
recommend them to the Children of Violence or Folly.</p><p>I have by me a Bundle of Memorials presented by several Cavaliers upon
the Restauration of K. _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec629.txt')">Charles</a>_ II. which may serve as so many
Instances, to our present Purpose.</p><p>Among several Persons and Pretensions recorded by my Author, he mentions
one of a very great Estate, who, for having roasted an Ox whole, and
distributed a Hogshead upon K. _Charles's_ Birth-day, desired to be
provided for, as his Majesty in his great Wisdom shall think fit.</p><p>Another put in to be <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec629.txt')">Prince</a> _Henry's_, Governor, for having dared to
drink his Health in the worst of Times.</p><p>A Third petitioned for a Colonel's Commission, for having Cursed _Oliver
Cromwell_, the Day before his Death, on a publick Bowling-Green.</p><p>But the most whimsical Petition I have met with is that of _B. B._ Esq.,
who desir'd the Honour of Knighthood, for having Cuckolded Sir _T. W._ a
notorious _Roundhead_.</p><p>There is likewise the Petition of one, who having let his Beard grow
from the Martyrdom of K. _Charles_ the First, till the Restauration of
K. _Charles_ the Second, desired, in Consideration thereof, to be made a
Privy-Counsellor.</p><p>I must not omit a Memorial setting forth, that the Memorialist had, with
great dispatch, carried a Letter from a certain Lord to a certain Lord,
wherein, as it afterwards appeared, Measures were concerted for the
Restauration, and without which he verily believes that happy Revolution
had never been effected; who thereupon humbly prays to be made
Post-Master-General.</p><p>A certain Gentleman, who seems to write with a great deal of Spirit, and
uses the Words _Gallantry_ and _Gentleman-like_ very often in his
Petition, begs that (in Consideration of his having worn his Hat for ten
Years past in the Loyal Cavalier-Cock, to his great Danger and
Detriment) he may be made a Captain of the Guards.</p><p>I shall close my Account of this Collection of Memorials, with the Copy
of one Petition at length, which I recommend to my Reader as a very
valuable Piece.</p><p>
_The Petition of E. H. Esq., humbly Sheweth,_</p><p>'That your Petitioner's Father's Brother's Uncle, Colonel _W. H._ lost
the Third Finger of his Left Hand at _Edge-hill_ Fight.</p><p>'That your Petitioner, notwithstanding the Smallness of his Fortune,
(he being a younger Brother) always kept Hospitality, and drank
Confusion to the Roundheads in half a Score Bumpers every _Sunday_ in
the Year, as several honest Gentlemen (whose Names are underwritten)
are ready to testifie.</p><p>'That your Petitioner is remarkable in his Country for having dared to
treat Sir _P. P._ a cursed Sequestrator, and three Members of the
Assembly of Divines, with Brawn and Minced Pies upon _New Year's_ Day.</p><p>'That your said humble Petitioner hath been five times imprisoned in
five several County-Goals, for having been a Ring-leader in five
different Riots; into which his Zeal for the Royal Cause hurried him,
when men of greater Estates had not the Courage to rise.</p><p>'That he, the said _E. H._ hath had six Duels and four and twenty
Boxing-Matches in Defence of his Majesty's Title; and that he received
such a Blow upon the Head at a Bonfire in _Stratford_ upon _Avon_, as
he hath been never the better for from that Day to this.</p><p>'That your Petitioner hath been so far from improving his Fortune, in
the late damnable Times, that he verily believes, and hath good Reason
to imagine, that if he had been Master of an Estate, he had infallibly
been plundered and sequestred.</p><p>'Your Petitioner, in Consideration of his said Merits and Sufferings,
humbly requests that he may have the Place of Receiver of the Taxes,
Collector of the Customs, Clerk of the Peace, Deputy Lieutenant, or
whatsoever else he shall be thought qualified for.</p><p>_And your Petitioner shall ever Pray, &c._</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
