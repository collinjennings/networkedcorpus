<p>No. 630.                 Wednesday, December 8, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Favete linguis--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Having no spare Time to write any thing of my own, or to correct what is
sent me by others, I have thought fit to publish the following Letters.</p><p>
_Oxford, November 22._</p><p>_SIR,_</p><p>'If you would be so kind to me, as to suspend that Satisfaction, which
the Learned <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec630.txt')">World</a> must receive in reading one of your Speculations, by
publishing this Endeavour, you will very much oblige and improve one,
who has the Boldness to hope, that he may be admitted into the number
of your Correspondents.</p><p>'I have often wondered to hear Men of good Sense and good <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec630.txt')">Nature</a>
profess a Dislike to Musick, when, at the same time, they do not
scruple to own, that it has the most <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec630.txt')">agreeable</a> and improving
Influences over their Minds: It seems to me an unhappy Contradiction,
that those Persons should have an Indifference for an Art, which
raises in them such a Variety of sublime Pleasures.</p><p>'However, though some few, by their own or the unreasonable Prejudices
of others, may be led into a Distaste for those Musical Societies
which are erected merely for Entertainment, yet sure I may venture to
say, that no one can have the least <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec630.txt')">Reason</a> for Disaffection to that
solemn kind of Melody which consists of the Praises of our Creator.</p><p>'You have, I presume, already prevented me in an Argument upon this
Occasion (which some Divines have successfully advanced upon a much
greater) that Musical Sacrifice and Adoration has claimed a Place in
the Laws and Customs of the most different Nations; As the _Grecians_
and _Romans_ of the Prophane, the _Jews_ and _Christians_ of the
Sacred World did as unanimously agree in this, as they disagreed in
all other Parts of their OEconomy.</p><p>'I know there are not wanting some who are of Opinion that the pompous
kind of Musick which is in Use in foreign Churches is the most
excellent, as it most affects our Senses. But I am swayed by my
Judgment to the Modesty which is observed in the musical Part of our
Devotions. Methinks there is something very laudable in the Custom of
a _Voluntary_ before the first Lesson; by this we are supposed to be
prepared for the Admission of those <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec630.txt')">Divine</a> Truths, which we are
shortly to receive. We are then to cast all worldly Regards from off
our Hearts, all Tumults within are then becalmed, and there should be
nothing near the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec630.txt')">Soul</a> but Peace and Tranquility. So that in this short
Office of Praise, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec630.txt')">Man</a> is raised above himself, and is almost lost
already amidst the Joys of Futurity.</p><p>'I have heard some nice Observers frequently commend the Policy of our
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec630.txt')">Church</a> in this Particular, that it leads us on by such easie and
regular Methods, that we are perfectly deceived into Piety. When the
Spirits begin to languish (as they too often do) with a constant
Series of Petitions, she takes care to allow them a pious Respite, and
relieves them with the Raptures of an Anthem. Nor can we doubt that
the sublimest Poetry, softened in the most moving Strains of Musick,
can ever fail of humbling or exalting the Soul to any Pitch of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec630.txt')">Devotion</a>. Who can hear the Terrors of the Lord of Hosts described in
the most expressive Melody, without being awed into a Veneration? or
who can hear the kind and endearing Attributes of a merciful Father,
and not be softened into Love towards him!</p><p>'As the rising and sinking of the Passions, the casting soft or noble
Hints into the Soul, is the natural Privilege of Musick in general, so
more particularly of that kind which is employed at the Altar. Those
Impressions which it leaves upon the Spirits are more deep and
lasting, as the Grounds from which it receives its Authority are
founded more upon Reason. It diffuses a Calmness all around us, it
makes us drop all those vain or immodest Thoughts which would be an
hindrance to us in the Performance of that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec630.txt')">great</a> Duty of Thanksgiving,
[1] which, as we are informed by our Almighty Benefactor, is the most
acceptable Return which can be made for those <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec630.txt')">infinite</a> Stores of
Blessings which he daily condescends to pour down upon his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec630.txt')">Creatures</a>.
When we make Use of this pathetical Method of addressing our selves to
him, we can scarce contain from Raptures! The Heart is warmed with a
Sublimity of Goodness. We are all Piety and all Love!</p><p>'How do the Blessed Spirits rejoice and wonder to behold unthinking
Man prostrating his Soul to his dread Sovereign in such a Warmth of
Piety as they themselves might not be ashamed of!</p><p>'I shall close these Reflections with a Passage taken out of the Third
Book of _Milton's Paradise Lost_, where those harmonious Beings are
thus nobly described.</p><p>'Then Crown'd again, their Gold'n Harps they took,
Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by their side
Like Quivers hung, and with Preamble sweet
Of Charming Symphony they introduce
The Sacred Song, and waken Raptures high;
No one exempt, no Voice but well could join
Melodious part, such Concord is in Heav'n'</p><p>
_Mr_. SPECTATOR,</p><p>'The Town cannot be unacquainted, that in divers Parts of it there are
vociferous Setts of Men who are called _Rattling Clubs_; but what
shocks me most is, they have now the Front to invade the Church and
institute these Societies there, as a Clan of them have in late times
done, to such a degree of Insolence, as has given the Partition where
they reside in a Church near one of the City Gates, the Denomination
of the _Rattling Pew_. These gay Fellows, from humble Lay Professions,
set up for Criticks without any Tincture of Letters or Reading, and
have the Vanity to think they can lay hold of something from the
Parson, which may be formed into Ridicule.</p><p>'It is needless to observe, that the Gentlemen who every _Sunday_ have
the hard Province of Instructing these Wretches in a way they are in
no present Disposition to take, have a fixt Character for Learning and
Eloquence, not to be tainted by the weak Efforts of this Contemptible
Part of their Audiences. Whether the Pulpit is taken by these
Gentlemen, or any Strangers their Friends, the way of the Club is
this: If any Sentiments are delivered too Sublime for their
Conception; if any uncommon Topick is entered on, or one in use new
modified with the finest Judgment and Dexterity; or any controverted
Point be never so elegantly handled; In short whatever surpasses the
narrow Limits of their Theology, or is not suited to their Taste, they
are all immediately upon their Watch, fixing their Eyes upon each
other, with as much Warmth as our Gladiators of _Hockley in the Hole_,
and waiting like them for a Hit; if one touches, all take Fire, and
their Noddles instantly meet in the Centre of the Pew; then, as by
beat of Drum, with exact Discipline, they rear up into a full length
of Stature, and with odd Looks and Gesticulations confer together in
so loud and clamorous a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec630.txt')">manner</a>, continued to the close of the
Discourse, and during the After-Psalm, as is not to be silenced but by
the Bells. Nor does this suffice them, without aiming to propagate
their Noise through all the Church, by Signals given to the adjoyning
Seats, where others designed for this Fraternity are sometimes placed
upon Tryal to receive them.</p><p>'The Folly as well as Rudeness of this Practice is in nothing more
conspicuous than this, that all that follows in the Sermon is lost;
for whenever our Sparks take alarm, they blaze out and grow so
Tumultuous that no After-Explanation can avail, it being impossible
for themselves or any near them to give an Account thereof. If any
thing really Novel is advanced, how averse soever it may be to their
way of thinking, to say nothing of Duty, Men of less Levity than these
would be led by a natural Curiosity to hear the whole.</p><p>'Laughter, where <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec630.txt')">things</a> Sacred are transacted, is far less pardonable
than Whining at a Conventicle; the last has at least a Semblance of
Grace, and where the Affectation is unseen may possibly imprint
wholesome Lessons on the Sincere; but the first has no Excuse,
breaking through all the Rules of Order and Decency, and manifesting a
Remissness of Mind in those important Matters, which require the
strictest Composure and Steadiness of Thought; A Proof of the greatest
Folly in the World.</p><p>'I shall not here enter upon the Veneration due to the Sanctity of the
Place, the Reverence owing to the Minister, or the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec630.txt')">Respect</a> that so
great an Assembly as a whole Parish may justly claim. I shall only
tell them, that as the _Spanish_ Cobler, to reclaim a profligate Son,
bid him _have some regard to the Dignity of his Family_, so they as
Gentlemen (for we Citizens assume to be such one Day in a Week) are
bound for the future to Repent of, and Abstain from, the gross Abuses
here mentioned, whereof they have been Guilty in Contempt of Heaven
and Earth, and contrary to the Laws in this Case made and provided.</p><p>_I am, SIR,
Your very humble Servant_,
R. M.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: A Proclamation appeared the day before this Paper,
ordaining a Thanksgiving for King George's Accession to be observed on
the 20th of January.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
