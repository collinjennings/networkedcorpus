<p>No. 631.                  Friday, December 10, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Simplex Munditiis--'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>I had occasion to go a few Miles out of Town, some Days since, in a
Stage-Coach, where I had for my Fellow-Tavellers a dirty Beau, and a
pretty young Quaker-Woman. Having no Inclination to Talk much at that
time, I placed my self backward, with a design to survey them, and pick
a Speculation out of my two Companions. Their different Figures were
sufficient of themselves to draw my Attention. The Gentleman was <a name="topic38" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec631.txt')">dressed</a>
in a Suit, the Ground whereof had been <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec631.txt')">Black</a>, as I perceived from some
few Spaces, that had escaped the Powder, which was Incorporated with the
greatest part of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec631.txt')">Coat</a>: His Perriwig, which cost no small Sum, [1]
was after so slovenly a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec631.txt')">manner</a> cast over his Shoulders, that it seemed
not to have been combed since the Year 1712; his Linnen, which was not
much concealed, was daubed with plain _Spanish_ from the Chin to the
lowest Button, and the Diamond upon his Finger (which naturally dreaded
the Water) put me in Mind how it sparkled amidst the Rubbish of the
Mine, where it was first discovered. On the other hand, the pretty
Quaker appeared in all the Elegance of Cleanliness. Not a Speck was to
be found on her. A clear, clean oval Face, just edged about with little
thin Plaits of the purest Cambrick, received great Advantages from the
Shade of her black Hood; as did the Whiteness of her Arms from that
sober-coloured Stuff, in which she had Cloathed her self. The Plainness
of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec631.txt')">Dress</a> was very well suited to the Simplicity of her Phrases; all
which put together, though they could not give me a great Opinion of her
Religion, they did of her Innocence.</p><p>This Adventure occasioned my throwing together a few hints upon
_Cleanliness_, which I shall consider as one of the _Half-<a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec631.txt')">Virtues</a>_, as
_Aristotle_ calls them, and shall recommend it under the three following
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('38', 'spec631.txt')">Heads</a>, As it is a Mark of Politeness; As it produces Love; and As it
bears Analogy to Purity of Mind.</p><p>_First_, It is a Mark of Politeness. It is universally agreed upon, that
no one, unadorn'd with this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec631.txt')">Virtue</a>, can go into <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec631.txt')">Company</a> without giving a
manifest Offence. The easier or higher any one's Fortune is, this Duty
arises proportionably. The different Nations of the World are as much
distinguished by their Cleanliness, as by their Arts and Sciences. The
more any Country is civilized, the more they consult this part of
Politeness. We need but compare our Ideas of a Female _Hottentot_ and an
_English_ Beauty, to be satisfied of the Truth of what hath been
advanced.</p><p>In the next Place, Cleanliness may be said to be the Foster-Mother of
Love. Beauty indeed most commonly produces that Passion in the Mind, but
Cleanliness preserves it. An indifferent Face and Person, kept in
perpetual Neatness, had won many a Heart from a pretty Slattern. Age it
self is not unamiable, while it is preserved clean and unsullied: Like a
piece of Metal constantly kept smooth and bright, we look on it with
more Pleasure than on a new Vessel that is canker'd with Rust.</p><p>I might observe farther, that as Cleanliness renders us <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec631.txt')">agreeable</a> to
others, so it makes us easie to our selves; that it is an excellent
Preservative of Health; and that several Vices, destructive both to Mind
and Body, are inconsistent with the Habit of it. But these Reflections I
shall leave to the Leisure of my Readers, and shall observe in the Third
Place, that it bears a great Analogy with Purity of Mind, and naturally
inspires refined Sentiments and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec631.txt')">Passions</a>.</p><p>We find from Experience, that through the Prevalence of Custom, the most
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec631.txt')">vicious</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec631.txt')">Actions</a> lose their Horror, by being made familiar to us. On the
contrary, those who live in the Neighbourhood of good Examples, fly from
the first Appearances of what is shocking. It fares with us much after
the same Manner, as to our Ideas. Our Senses, which are the Inlets to
all the Images conveyed to the Mind, can only transmit the Impression of
such things as usually surround them. So that pure and unsullied
Thoughts are naturally suggested to the Mind, by those Objects that
perpetually encompass us, when they are beautiful and elegant in their
kind.</p><p>In the East, where the Warmth of the Climate makes Cleanliness more
immediately necessary than in colder Countries, it is made one Part of
their Religion: The _Jewish_ Law, (and the _Mahometan_, which in some
things copies after it) is filled with Bathings, Purifications, and
other Rites of the like Nature. Though there is the above-named
convenient Reason to be assigned for these Ceremonies, the chief
Intention undoubtedly was to typifie inward Purity and Cleanness of
Heart by those outward Washings. We read several Injunctions of this
Kind in the Book of _Deuteronomy_, which confirm this Truth; and which
are but ill accounted for by saying, as some do, that they were only
instituted for Convenience in the Desart, which otherwise could not have
been habitable for so many Years.</p><p>I shall conclude this Essay, with a Story which I have somewhere read in
an Account of _Mahometan_ Superstitions.</p><p>A _Dervise_ of great Sanctity one Morning had the Misfortune as he took
up a Chrystal Cup, which was consecrated to the Prophet, to let it fall
upon the Ground, and dash it in Pieces. His Son coming in, some time
after, he stretched out his Hands to bless him, as his manner was every
Morning; but the Youth going out stumbled over the Threshold and broke
his Arm. As the old Man wondered at these Events, a Caravan passed by in
its way from _Mecca_. The _Dervise_ approached it to beg a Blessing; but
as he stroaked one of the Holy Camels, he received a Kick from the
Beast, that sorely bruised him. His Sorrow and Amazement increased upon
him, till he recollected that through Hurry and Inadvertency he had that
Morning come abroad without washing his Hands.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Duumvir's fair wig cost 40 guineas. _Tatler_, No. 54.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
