<p>No. 632.                 Monday, December 13, 1714.</p><p></p><p>'--Explebo numerum, reddarque tenebris--'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>The Love of Symmetry and Order, which is natural to the Mind of Man,
betrays him sometimes into very whimsical Fancies. _This noble
Principle_, says a _French_ <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec632.txt')">Author</a>, _loves to amuse it self on the most
trifling Occasions. You may see a profound Philosopher_, says he, _walk
for an Hour together in his Chamber, and industriously treading, at
every Step, upon every other Board in the Flooring_. Every <a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec632.txt')">Reader</a> will
recollect several Instances of this Nature without my Assistance. I
think it was _Gregorio Leti_ who had published as many Books as he was
Years old; [1] which was a Rule he had laid down and punctually observed
to the Year of his Death. It was, perhaps, a Thought of the like Nature
which determined _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec632.txt')">Homer</a>_ himself to divide each of his Poems into as
many Books, as there are Letters in the _Greek_ Alphabet. _Herodotus_
has in the same manner adapted his Books to the Number of the _Muses_,
for which Reason many a Learned man hath wished there had been more than
Nine of that Sisterhood.</p><p>Several _Epic_ Poets have religiously followed _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec632.txt')">Virgil</a>_ as to the Number
of his Books; and even _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec632.txt')">Milton</a>_ is thought by many to have changed the
Number of his Books from Ten to Twelve, for no other Reason; as _Cowley_
tells us, it was his Design, had he finished his _Davideis_, to have
also imitated the _Ã†neid_ in this Particular. I believe every one will
agree with me, that a Perfection of this Nature hath no Foundation in
Reason; and, with due Respect to these great Names, may be looked upon
as something whimsical.</p><p>I mention these great Examples in Defence of my Bookseller, who
occasioned this Eighth Volume of _Spectators_, because, as he said, he
thought Seven a very Odd Number. On the other Side, several grave
Reasons were urged on this important Subject; as in particular, that
Seven was the precise Number of the Wise Men, and that the most
Beautiful Constellation in the Heavens was composed of Seven Stars. This
he allowed to be true, but still insisted, that Seven was an Odd Number;
suggesting at the same time that if he were provided with a sufficient
Stock of leading Papers, he should find Friends ready enough to carry on
the Work. Having by this means got his Vessel launched and set afloat,
he hath committed the Steerage of it, from time to time, to such as he
thought capable of conducting it.</p><p>The Close of this Volume, which the Town may now expect in a little
time, may possibly ascribe each Sheet to its proper Author.</p><p>It were no hard Task to continue this Paper a considerable Time longer,
by the Help of large Contributions sent from unknown Hands.</p><p>I cannot give the Town a better Opinion of the SPECTATOR'S
Correspondents, than by publishing the following Letter, with a very
fine Copy of Verses upon a Subject perfectly new.</p><p>
_Dublin, Nov_. 30, 1714.</p><p>_Mr._ SPECTATOR,</p><p>'You lately recommended to your Female Readers, the good old Custom of
their Grandmothers, who used to lay out a great Part of their Time in
Needle-work: I entirely agree with you in your Sentiments, and think
it would not be of less Advantage to themselves, and their Posterity,
than to the Reputation of many of their good Neighbours, if they past
many of those Hours in this innocent Entertainment, which are lost at
the Tea-Table. I would, however, humbly offer to your Consideration,
the Case of the Poetical Ladies; who, though they may be willing to
take any Advice given them by the SPECTATOR, yet can't so easily quit
their Pen and Ink, as you may imagine. Pray allow them, at least now
and then, to indulge themselves in other Amusements of Fancy, when
they are tired with stooping to their Tapestry. There is a very
particular <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec632.txt')">kind</a> of Work, which of late several Ladies here in our
Kingdom are very fond of, which seems very well adapted to a Poetical
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec632.txt')">Genius</a>: It is the making of _Grotto's_. I know a Lady who has a very
Beautiful one, composed by her self, nor is there one Shell in it not
stuck up by her own Hands. I here send you a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec632.txt')">Poem</a> to the fair
Architect, which I would not offer to herself, till I knew whether
this Method of a Lady's passing her Time were approved of by the
_British_ SPECTATOR, which, with the Poem, I submit to your Censure,
who am,</p><p>_Your Constant Reader, and Humble Servant_,
A.B.</p><p>
To Mrs.--on her _Grotto_.</p><p>A_ Grotto _so compleat, with such Design,
What Hands, Calypso, cou'd have form'd but Thine?
Each chequer'd Pebble, and each shining Shell,
So well proportion'd, and dispos'd so well,
Surprizing Lustre from thy Thought receive,
Assuming Beauties more than Nature gave.
To Her their various Shapes, and glossy Hue,
Their curious Symmetry they owe to You.
Not fam'd_ Amphion's _Lute,--whose powerful Call
Made Willing Stones dance to the_ Theban _Wall,
In more harmonious Ranks cou'd make them fall.
Not Ev'ning Cloud a brighter Arch can show,
Nor richer Colours paint the heav'nly Bow.</p><p>Where can unpolished Nature boast a Piece,
In all her Mossie Cells exact as This?
At the gay parti-color'd Scene--we start,
For Chance too regular, too rude for Art,</p><p>Charmed with the sight, my ravish'd Breast is fir'd
With Hints like those which ancient Bards inspir'd;
All the feign'd Tales by Superstition told,
All the bright Train of fabled Nymphs of Old,
Th' enthusiastick Muse believes are true,
Thinks the Spot sacred, and its Genius You.
Lost in wild Rapture, wou'd she fain disclose,
How by degrees the pleasing Wonder rose:
Industrious in a faithful <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec632.txt')">Verse</a> to trace
The various Beauties of the lovely Place;
And while she keeps the glowing Work in View,
Thro' ev'ry Maze thy Artful Hand pursue.</p><p>Oh were I equal to the bold Design,
Or cou'd I boast such happy Art as Thine!
That cou'd rude Shells in such sweet Order place,
Give common Objects such uncommon Grace!
Like them my well-chose <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec632.txt')">Words</a> in ev'ry Line,
As sweetly temper'd should as sweetly shine.
So just a Fancy shou'd my Numbers warm,
Like the gay Piece shou'd the Description charm.
Then with superior Strength my Voice I'd raise,
The echoing_ Grotto _shou'd approve my Lays,
Pleas'd to reflect the well-sung Founder's Praise.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: His boast was that he had been the author of a book and
father of a child for 20 years successively.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
