<p>No. 633.            Wednesday, December 15, 1714.           Z. Pearce.</p><p></p><p>'Omnia profecto, cum se Ã  coelestibus rebus referet ad humanas,
excelsius magnificentiusque et dicet et sentiet.'</p><p>Cicer.</p><p></p><p>The following Discourse is printed, as it came to my Hands, without
Variation.</p><p>
_Cambridge, Dec. 12_.</p><p>'It was a very common Enquiry among the Ancients why the Number of
excellent Orators, under all the Encouragements the most flourishing
States could give them, fell so far short of the Number of those who
excelled in all other Sciences. A Friend of mine used merrily to apply
to this Case an Observation of _Herodotus_, who says, That the most
useful Animals are the most fruitful in their Generation; whereas the
Species of those Beasts that are fierce and mischievous to Mankind are
but scarcely continued. The Historian instances in a Hare, which
always either breeds or brings forth; and a Lioness, which brings
forth but once, and then loses all Power of Conception. But, leaving
my Friend to his Mirth, I am of Opinion, that in these latter Ages we
have greater Cause of Complaint than the Ancients had. And since that
solemn Festival is approaching, which calls for all the Power of
Oratory, and which affords as noble a Subject for the Pulpit as any
Revelation has taught us, the Design of this Paper shall be to show,
that our Moderns have greater Advantages towards true and solid
Eloquence, than any which the celebrated Speakers of Antiquity
enjoy'd.</p><p>'The first <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec633.txt')">great</a> and substantial Difference is, that their
Common-Places, in which almost the whole Force of Amplification
consists, were drawn from the Profit or Honesty of the <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec633.txt')">Action</a>, as they
regarded only this present State of Duration. But Christianity, as it
exalts Morality to a greater Perfection, as it brings the
Consideration of another Life into the Question, as it proposes
Rewards and Punishments of a higher <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec633.txt')">Nature</a>, and a longer Continuance,
is more adapted to affect the Minds of the Audience, naturally
inclined to pursue what it imagines its greatest Interest and Concern.
If _Pericles_, as Historians report, could shake the firmest
Resolutions of his Hearers, and set the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec633.txt')">Passions</a> of all _Greece_ in a
Ferment, when the present Welfare of his Country, or the Fear of
hostile Invasions, was the Subject: What may be expected from that
Orator, who warns his Audience against those Evils which have no
Remedy, when once undergone, either from Prudence or Time? As much
greater as the Evils in a future State are than these at present, so
much are the Motives to Persuasion under Christianity greater than
those which meer moral Considerations could supply us with. But what I
now mention relates only to the Power of moving the Affections. There
is another Part of Eloquence, which is indeed its Master-piece; I mean
the Marvellous or Sublime. In this the <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec633.txt')">Christian</a> Orator has the
Advantage beyond Contradiction. Our Ideas are so infinitely enlarged
by Revelation, the Eye of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec633.txt')">Reason</a> has so wide a Prospect into Eternity,
the Notions of a Deity are so <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec633.txt')">worthy</a> and refined, and the Accounts we
have of a State of Happiness or Misery so clear and evident, that the
Contemplation of such Objects will give our Discourse a noble Vigour,
an invincible Force, beyond the Power of any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec633.txt')">human</a> Consideration.
_Tully_ requires in his Perfect Orator some Skill in the Nature of
Heavenly Bodies, because, says he, his Mind will become more extensive
and unconfined; and when he descends to treat of human Affairs, he
will both think and write in a more exalted and magnificent Manner.
For the same Reason that excellent Master would have recommended the
Study of those great and glorious Mysteries which Revelation has
discovered to us; to which the noblest Parts of this System of the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec633.txt')">World</a> are as much inferiour, as the Creature is less excellent than
its Creator. The wisest and most knowing among the Heathens had very
poor and imperfect Notions of a future State. They had indeed some
uncertain Hopes, either received by Tradition, or, gathered by Reason,
that the Existence of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec633.txt')">virtuous</a> Men would not be determined by the
Separation of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec633.txt')">Soul</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec633.txt')">Body</a>: But they either disbelieved a future
State of Punishment and Misery, or upon the same Account that
_Apelles_ painted _Antigonus_ with one Side only towards the
Spectator, that the Loss of his Eye might not cast a Blemish upon the
whole Piece; so these represented the Condition of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec633.txt')">Man</a> in its fairest
View, and endeavoured to conceal what they thought was a Deformity to
human Nature. I have often observed, that whenever the abovementioned
Orator in his Philosophical Discourses is led by his Argument to the
Mention of Immortality, he seems like one awaked out of Sleep, rous'd
and alarm'd with the Dignity of the Subject, he stretches his
Imagination to conceive something uncommon, and with the greatness of
his Thoughts, casts, as it were, a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec633.txt')">Glory</a> round the Sentence; Uncertain
and unsettled as he was, he seems fired with the Contemplation of it.
And nothing but such a Glorious Prospect could have forced so great a
Lover of Truth, as he was, to declare his Resolution never to part
with his Persuasion of Immortality, though it should be proved to be
an erroneous one. But had he lived to see all that Christianity has
brought to Light, how would he have lavished out all the Force of
Eloquence in those noblest Contemplations which humane Nature is
capable of, the Resurrection and the Judgment that follows it? How had
his Breast glowed with Pleasure, when the whole Compass of Futurity
lay open and exposed to his View? How would his Imagination have
hurried him on in the Pursuit of the Mysteries of the Incarnation? How
would he have enter'd, with the Force of Lightning, into the
Affections of his Hearers, and fixed their Attention, in spite of all
the Opposition of corrupt Nature, upon those glorious Themes which his
Eloquence hath painted in such lively and lasting Colours?</p><p>'This Advantage Christians have; and it was with no small Pleasure I
lately met with a Fragment of _Longinus_, which is preserv'd, as a
Testimony of that Critick's Judgment, at the Beginning of a Manuscript
of the New Testament in the _Vatican_ Library. After that Author has
number'd up the most celebrated Orators among the _Grecians_, he says,
_Add to these_ Paul _of_ Tarsus, _the Patron of an Opinion not yet
fully proved_. As a Heathen, he condemns the Christian <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec633.txt')">Religion</a>; and,
as an impartial Critick, he judges in Favour of the Promoter and
Preacher of it. To me it seems, that the latter Part of his Judgment
adds great Weight to his Opinion of St. _Paul's_ Abilities, since,
under all the Prejudice of Opinions directly opposite, he is
constrained to acknowledge the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec633.txt')">Merit</a> of that Apostle. And, no doubt,
such as _Longinus_ describes St. _Paul_, such he appeared to the
Inhabitants of those Countries which he visited and blessed with those
Doctrines was divinely commissioned to preach. Sacred Story gives us,
in one Circumstance, a convincing Proof of his Eloquence, when the Men
of _Lystra_ called him _Mercury, because he was the chief Speaker_,
and would have paid <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec633.txt')">Divine</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec633.txt')">Worship</a> to him, as to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec633.txt')">God</a> who invented
and presided over Eloquence. This one Account of our Apostle sets his
Character, consider'd as an Orator only, above all the celebrated
Relations of the Skill and Influence of _Demosthenes_ and his
Contemporaries. Their Power in Speaking was admired, but still it was
thought human: Their Eloquence warmed and ravished the Hearers, but
still it was thought the Voice of Man, not the Voice of God. What
Advantage then had St. _Paul_ above those of _Greece_, or _Rome_? I
confess I can ascribe this Excellence to nothing but the Power of the
Doctrines he delivered, which may have still the same Influence on the
Hearers; which have still the Power, when preached by a skilful
Orator, to make us break out in the same Expressions, as the Disciples
who met our Saviour in their Way to _Emmaus_, made use of; _Did not
our Hearts burn within us, when he talked to us by the Way, and while
he opened to us the Scriptures_? I may be thought bold in my Judgment
by some; but I must affirm, That no one Orator has left us so visible
Marks and Footsteps of his Eloquence as our Apostle. It may perhaps be
wondered at, that in his Reasonings upon Idolatry at _Athens_, where
Eloquence was born and flourished, he confines himself to strict
Argument only; but my Reader may remember what many Authors of the
best Credit have assured us, That all Attempts upon the Affections and
Strokes of Oratory were expressly forbidden, by the Laws of that
Country, in Courts of Judicature. His want of Eloquence therefore
here, was the Effect of his exact Conformity to the Laws. But his
Discourse on the Resurrection to the _Corinthians_, his Harangue
before _Agrippa_ upon his own Conversion and the Necessity of that of
others, are truly Great, and may serve as full Examples to those
excellent Rules for the Sublime, which the best of Criticks has left
us. The Sum of all this Discourse is, That our Clergy have no farther
to look for an Example of the Perfection they may arrive at, than to
St. _Paul_'s Harangues; that when he, under the Want of several
Advantages of Nature (as he himself tells us) was heard, admired, and
made a Standard to succeeding Ages by the best Judge of a different
Persuasion in Religion, I say our Clergy may learn, That, however
instructive their Sermons are, they are capable of receiving a great
Addition; which St. _Paul_ has given them a noble Example of, and the
Christian Religion has furnished them with certain Means of attaining
to.'</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
