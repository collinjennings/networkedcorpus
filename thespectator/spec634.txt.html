<p>No. 634.                Friday, December 17, 1714.</p><p></p><p>[Greek: Ho elachístôn deómenos éggista theôn.]</p><p>Socrates apud Xen.</p><p></p><p>It was the common Boast of the Heathen Philosophers, that by the
Efficacy of their several Doctrines, they made Humane <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec634.txt')">Nature</a> resemble
the <a name="topic0" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec634.txt')">Divine</a>. How much mistaken soever they might be in the several Means
they proposed for this End, it must be owned that the Design was <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec634.txt')">great</a>
and glorious. The finest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec634.txt')">Works</a> of Invention and Imagination are of very
little Weight, when put in the Balance with what refines and exalts the
rational Mind. _Longinus_ excuses _Homer_ very handsomely, when he says
the Poet made his Gods like Men, that he might make his Men appear like
the Gods: But it must be allowed that several of the ancient
Philosophers acted, as _Cicero_ wishes _Homer_ had done; they
endeavoured rather to make Men like Gods, than Gods like Men.</p><p>According to this general Maxim in Philosophy, some of them have
endeavoured to place Men in such a State of Pleasure, or Indolence at
least, as they vainly imagined the Happiness of the Supreme Being to
consist in. On the other Hand, the most virtuous Sect of Philosophers
have created a chimerical wise <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec634.txt')">Man</a>, whom they made exempt from Passion
and Pain, and thought it enough to pronounce him All-sufficient.</p><p>This last Character, when divested of the Glare of Humane Philosophy
that surrounds it, signifies no more, than that a Good and Wise Man
should so arm himself with Patience, as not to yield tamely to the
Violence of Passion and Pain; that he should learn so to suppress and
contract his Desires as to have few Wants; and that he should cherish so
many Virtues in his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec634.txt')">Soul</a>, as to have a perpetual Source of Pleasure in
himself.</p><p>The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec634.txt')">Christian</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('0', 'spec634.txt')">Religion</a> requires, that, after having framed the best
Idea, we are able, of the Divine Nature, it should be our next Care to
conform our selves to it, as far as our Imperfections will permit. I
might mention several Passages in the sacred Writings on this Head, to
which I might add many Maxims and wise Sayings of Moral Authors among
the _Greeks_ and _Romans_.</p><p>I shall only instance a remarkable Passage, to this Purpose, out of
_Julian's Cæsars_. The Emperor having represented all the _Roman_
Emperors, with _Alexander_ the Great, as passing in Review before the
Gods, and striving for the Superiority, lets them all drop, excepting
_Alexander_, _Julius Cæ<a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec634.txt')">sar</a>_, _Augustus Cæsar_, _Trajan_, _Marcus
Aurelius_, and _Constantine_. Each of these great Heroes of Antiquity
lays in his Claim for the upper Place; and, in Order to it, sets forth
his Actions after the most advantageous Manner. But the Gods, instead of
being dazzled with the Lustre of their Actions, enquire, by _Mercury_,
into the proper Motive and governing Principle that influenced them
throughout the whole Series of their Lives and Exploits. _Alexander_
tells them, That his Aim was to conquer: _Julius Cæsar_, that his was to
gain the highest Post in his Country; _Augustus_, To govern well;
_Trajan_, That His was the same as that of _Alexander_, namely, To
conquer. The Question, at length, was put to _Marcus Aurelius_, who
replied, with great Modesty, That _it had always been his Care to
imitate the Gods_. This Conduct seems to have gained him the most Votes
and best Place in the whole Assembly. _Marcus Aurelius_ being afterwards
asked to explain himself declares, That, by imitating the Gods, he
endeavoured to imitate them in the Use of his Understanding, and of all
other Faculties; and, in particular, That it was always his <a name="topic23" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('23', 'spec634.txt')">Study</a> to
have as few Wants as possible in himself, and to do all the Good he
could to others.</p><p>Among the many Methods by which Revealed Religion has advanced Morality,
this is one, That it has given us a more just and perfect Idea of that
Being whom every reasonable Creature ought to imitate. The young Man, in
a Heathen Comedy, might justify his Lewdness by the Example of
_Jupiter_; as, indeed, there was scarce any Crime that might not be
countenanced by those Notions of the Deity which prevailed among the
common People in the Heathen <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec634.txt')">World</a>. Revealed Religion sets forth a
proper Object for Imitation, in that Being who is the Pattern, as well
as the Source, of all spiritual Perfection.</p><p>While we remain in this Life, we are subject to innumerable Temptations,
which, if listen'd to, will make us deviate from <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec634.txt')">Reason</a> and Goodness,
the only <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec634.txt')">Things</a> wherein we can imitate the Supreme Being. In the next
Life we meet with nothing to excite our Inclinations that doth not
deserve them. I shall therefore dismiss my Reader with this Maxim, viz.
_Our Happiness in this World proceeds from the Suppression of our
Desires, but in the next World from the Gratification of them_.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
