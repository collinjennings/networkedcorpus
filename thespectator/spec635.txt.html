'Sentio Te sedem Hominum ac Domum contemplarique si tibi parva (ut
est) ita videtur, h√¶c coelestia semper Spectato; illa humana
contemnito.'</p><p>Cicero Somn. Scip.</p><p>
The following Essay comes from the ingenious Author of the Letter upon
_Novelty_, printed in a late _Spectator_: The Notions are drawn from the
_Platonick_ way of Thinking, but as they contribute to raise the Mind,
and may inspire noble Sentiments of our own future Grandeur and
Happiness, I think it well deserves to be presented to the Publick.</p><p>If the Universe be the Creature of an intelligent Mind, this Mind could
have no immediate Regard to himself in producing it. He needed not to
make Tryal of his Omnipotence, to be informed what Effects were within
its Reach: The World as existing in his eternal Idea was then as
beautiful as now it is drawn forth into Being; and in the immense Abyss
of his Essence are contained far brighter Scenes than will be ever set
forth to View; it being impossible that the great Author of Nature
should bound his own Power by giving Existence to a System of Creatures
so perfect that he cannot improve upon it by any other Exertions of his
Almighty Will. Between Finite and Infinite there is an unmeasured
Interval, not to be filled up in endless Ages; for which Reason, the
most excellent of all God's Works must be equally short of what his
Power is able to produce as the most imperfect, and may be exceeded with
the same Ease.</p><p>This Thought hath made some imagine, (what, it must be confest, is not
impossible) that the unfathomed Space is ever teeming with new Births,
the younger still inheriting a greater Perfection than the elder. But as
this doth not fall within my present View, I shall content my self with
taking Notice, that the Consideration now mentioned proves undeniably,
that the Ideal Worlds in the Divine Understanding yield a Prospect
incomparably more ample, various and delightful than any Created World
can do: And that therefore as it is not to be supposed that God should
make a World merely of inanimate Matter, however diversified; or
inhabited only by Creatures of no higher an Order than Brutes; so the
End for which he designed his reasonable Offspring is the Contemplation
of his Works, the Enjoyment of himself, and in both to be happy, having,
to this Purpose, endowed them with correspondent Faculties and Desires.
He can have no greater Pleasure from a bare Review of his Works, than
from the Survey of his own Ideas, but we may be assured that he is well
pleased in the Satisfaction derived to Beings capable of it, and, for
whose Entertainment, he hath erected this immense Theatre. Is not this
more than an Intimation of our Immortality? Man, who when considered as
on his Probation for a happy Existence hereafter is the most remarkable
Instance of Divine Wisdom; if we cut him off from all Relation to
Eternity, is the most wonderful and unaccountable Composition in the
whole Creation. He hath Capacities to lodge a much greater Variety of
Knowledge than he will be ever Master of, and an unsatisfied Curiosity
to tread the secret Paths of Nature and Providence: But, with this, his
Organs, in their present Structure, are rather fitted to serve the
Necessities of a vile Body, than to minister to his Understanding; and
from the little Spot to which he is chained, he can frame but wandering
Guesses concerning the innumerable Worlds of Light that encompass him,
which, tho' in themselves of a prodigious Bigness, do but just glimmer
in the remote Spaces of the Heavens; and, when with a great deal of Time
and Pains he hath laboured a little way up the steep Ascent of Truth,
and beholds with Pity the groveling Multitude beneath, in a Moment, his
Foot slides, and he tumbles down headlong into the Grave.</p><p>Thinking on this, I am obliged to believe, in Justice to the Creator of
the World, that there is another State when Man shall be better situated
for Contemplation, or rather have it in his Power to remove from Object
to Object, and from World to World; and be accommodated with Senses, and
other Helps, for making the quickest and most amazing Discoveries. How
doth such a Genius as Sir _Isaac Newton_, from amidst the Darkness that
involves human Understanding, break forth, and appear like one of
another Species! The vast Machine, we inhabit, lyes open to him, he
seems not unacquainted with the general Laws that govern it; and while
with the Transport of a Philosopher he beholds and admires the glorious
Work, he is capable of paying at once a more devout and more rational
Homage to his Maker. But alas! how narrow is the Prospect even of such a
Mind? and how obscure to the Compass that is taken in by the Ken of an
Angel; or of a Soul but newly escaped from its Imprisonment in the Body!
For my Part, I freely indulge my Soul in the Confidence of its future
Grandeur; it pleases me to think that I who know so small a portion of
the Works of the Creator, and with slow and painful Steps creep up and
down on the Surface of this Globe, shall e'er long shoot away with the
Swiftness of Imagination, trace out the hidden Springs of Nature's
Operations, be able to keep pace with the heavenly Bodies in the
Rapidity of their Career, be a Spectator of the long Chain of Events in
the natural and Moral Worlds, visit the several Apartments of the
Creation, know how they are furnished and how inhabited, comprehend the
Order, and measure the Magnitudes, and Distances of those Orbs, which to
us seem disposed without any regular Design, and set all in the same
Circle; observe the Dependance of the Parts of each System, and (if our
Minds are big enough to grasp the Theory) of the several Systems upon
one another, from whence results the Harmony of the Universe. In
Eternity a great deal may be done of this kind. I find it of use to
cherish this generous Ambition: for besides the secret Refreshment it
diffuses through my Soul, it engages me in an Endeavour to improve my
Faculties, as well as to exercise them conformably to the Rank I now
hold among reasonable Beings, and the Hope I have of being once advanced
to a more exalted Station.</p><p>The other, and that the Ultimate End of Man, is the Enjoyment of God,
beyond which he cannot form a Wish. Dim at best are the Conceptions we
have of the Supreme Being, who, as it were, keeps his Creatures in
Suspence, neither discovering, nor hiding himself; by which Means, the
Libertine hath a Handle to dispute his Existence, while the most are
content to speak him fair, but in their Hearts prefer every trifling
Satisfaction to the Favour of their Maker, and ridicule the good Man for
the Singularity of his Choice. Will there not a Time come, when the
Free-thinker shall see his impious Schemes overturned, and be made a
Convert to the Truths he hates; when deluded Mortals shall be convinced
of the Folly of their Pursuits, and the few Wise who followed the
Guidance of Heaven, and, scorning the Blandishments of Sense and the
sordid Bribery of the World, aspired to a celestial Abode, shall stand
possessed of their utmost Wish in the Vision of the Creator? Here the
Mind heaves a Thought now and then towards him, and hath some transient
Glances of his Presence: When, in the Instant it thinks it self to have
the fastest hold, the Object eludes its Expectations, and it falls back
tired and baffled to the Ground. Doubtless there is some more perfect
way of conversing with heavenly Beings. Are not Spirits capable of
Mutual Intelligence, unless immersed in Bodies, or by their
Intervention? Must superior Natures depend on inferior for the main
Privilege of sociable Beings, that of conversing with, and knowing each
other? What would they have done, had Matter never been created? I
suppose, not have lived in eternal Solitude. As incorporeal Substances
are of a nobler Order, so be sure, their manner of Intercourse is
answerably more expedite and intimate. This method of Communication, we
call Intellectual Vision, as somewhat Analogous to the Sense of Seeing,
which is the Medium of our Acquaintance with this visible World. And in
some such way can God make himself the Object of immediate Intuition to
the Blessed; and as he can, 'tis not improbable that he will, always
condescending, in the Circumstances of doing it, to the Weakness and
Proportion of finite Minds. His Works but faintly reflect the Image of
his Perfections, 'tis a Second-hand Knowledge: To have a just Idea of
him, it may be necessary that we see him as he is. But what is that?
'Tis something, that never entered into the Heart of Man to conceive;
yet what we can easily conceive, will be a Fountain of Unspeakable, of
Everlasting Rapture. All created Glories will fade and die away in his
Presence. Perhaps it will be my Happiness to compare the World with the
fair Exemplar of it in the Divine Mind; perhaps, to view the original
Plan of those wise Designs that have been executing in a long Succession
of Ages. Thus employed in finding out his Works, and contemplating their
Author! how shall I fall prostrate and adoring, my Body swallowed up in
the Immensity of Matter, my Mind in the Infinitude of his Perfections.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>ADDITIONAL NOTES.</p><p></p><p>_To No. 123._</p><p>
The following letter, dated July 21, 1711, was sent by Addison to his
friend Mr. Wortley Montagu, with No. 123 of the _Spectator_.</p><p>
'Dear Sir,</p><p>'Being very well pleased with this day's _Spectator_ I cannot forbear
sending you one of them, and desiring your opinion of the story in it.
When you have a son I shall be glad to be his Leontine, as my
circumstances will probably be like his. I have within this
twelvemonth lost a place of ¬£200 per ann., an estate in the Indies of
¬£14,000, and what is worse than all the rest, my mistress. Hear this,
and wonder at my philosophy. I find they are going to take away my
Irish place from me too: to which I must add, that I have just
resigned my fellowship, and that stocks sink every day. If you have
any hints or subjects, pray send me up a paper full. I long to talk an
evening with you. I believe I shall not go for Ireland this summer,
and perhaps would pass a month with you if I knew where. Lady Bellasis
is very much your humble servant. Dick Steele and I often remember
you.'</p><p>_I am, Dear Sir, Yours eternally_.</p><p></p><p>_To Nos. 453, 461, and 465._</p><p>The _Retrospective Review_, vol. xi. for 1825, in a cordially
appreciative review of the writings of Marvell, says,</p><p>'Captain Thompson was a very incorrect and injudicious editor of
Marvell's works. A very contemptible charge of plagiarism is also
preferred by the editor against Addison for the insertion of three
hymns in the _Spectator_, Nos. 453, 461, and 465; no proof whatever is
vouchsafed that they belong to Marvell, and the hymn inserted in the
_Spectator_, No. 461, "When Israel freed from Pharaoh's land," is now
known to be the noble composition of Dr. Watts.'</p><p>Captain Edward Thompson's edition of Marvell in 3 volumes quarto was
printed for the editor in 1776. Its great blunder was immediately
disposed of in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for September, 1776, and
February, 1777, where it was shown for example that Dr. Watts had
claimed and transferred his version of the 114th Psalm (which Captain
Thompson supposed to have been claimed by 'Tickle') to his volume of
_Divine Psalms and Hymns_, published in 1719. In the preface to that
volume Dr. Watts wrote,</p><p>'Where I have used three or four lines together of any author I have
acknowledged it in the notes.'</p><p>He did make frequent acknowledgment of lines or thoughts taken from
other poets in Psalms 6, 21, 63, 104, 139. But in a note to Ps. 114 he
absolutely spoke of the work as his own. Now the ground upon which
Thompson ascribed this piece to Marvell is precisely that on which he
also ascribed to Marvell Addison's poems in Nos. 453 and 465 of the
_Spectator_. He found them all in the latter part of a book of extracts
of which he said that the first part was in Marvell's handwriting, 'and
the rest copied by his order.' It is very doubtful whether even the
first part of the MS. book, containing verse of Marvell's, was really in
Marvell's handwriting, and that the part written later was copied by his
order, is an unfounded assumption. Captain Thompson said of the MS. book
that it was many years in the care of Mr. Nettleton, and communicated to
the editor by Mr. Thomas Raikes.--Probably it was Mr. Nettleton who in
his youth had added to the book copies of Addison's and Dr. Watts's
verses from the _Spectator_, and Mallet's version of the old ballad of
William and Margaret, all of which pieces Captain Edward Thompson
therefore supposed to have been written by Marvell.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>TRANSLATIONS OF THE MOTTOS.</p><p>No.</p><p>1. HOR. Ars Poet. ver. 143.</p><p>'One with a flash begins, and ends in smoke;

'Concerning the Small-Pox.</p><p>'R. Stroughton, Apothecary, at the Unicorn in Southwark, having about
Christmas last Published in the _Postman_, _Tatler_ and _Courant_, a
long Advertisement of his large Experience and great Success in curing
the Small-Pox, even of the worst Kind and Circumstances, having had a
Reputation for it almost 30 years, and can say than not 3 in 20
miscarry under his hands, doth now contract it; and only repeats, that
he thinks he has attain'd to as great a Certainty therein (and the
Measles which are near of Kin) as has been acquir'd in curing any one
disease (an Intermitting Feaver with the Bark only excepted) which he
conceives may at this time, when the Small-Pox so prevails, and is so
mortal, justify his Publications, being pressed by several so to do,
and hopes it may be for the Good of many: He has had many Patients
since his last Publication and but One of all dy'd. He hath also
Certificates from above 20 in a small time Cured, and of the worst
sort. What is here offered is Truth and Matter of Fact; and he will,
if desired, go with any one to the Persons themselves who have been
Cured, many of whom are People of Value and Figure: 'Tis by a correct
Management, more than a great deal of Physick, by which also the Face
and Eyes are much secured; tho' one Secret he has (obtained only by
Experience and which few or none know besides) that when they suddenly
strike in very rarely fails of raising them again in a few Hours, when
many other things, and proper too, have not answered. He does not
desire, nor aim at the supplanting of any Physician or Apothecary
concerned, but gives his assisting Advice if desired, and in such a
way not Dishonourable or Injurious to either.'</p><p>
