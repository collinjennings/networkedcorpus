<p>No. 7.            Thursday, March 8, 1711.              Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Somnia, terrores magicos, miracula, Sagas,
Nocturnos lemures, portentaque Thessala rides?'</p><p>Hor.</p><p></p><p>Going Yesterday to Dine with an old Acquaintance, I had the Misfortune
to find his whole Family very much dejected. Upon asking him the
Occasion of it, he told me that his <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec7.txt')">Wife</a> had dreamt a strange <a name="topic45" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec7.txt')">Dream</a> the
Night before, which they were afraid portended some Misfortune to
themselves or to their Children. At her coming into the Room, I observed
a settled Melancholy in her Countenance, which I should have been
troubled for, had I not heard from whence it proceeded. We were no
sooner sat down, but, after having looked upon me a little while,</p><p>'My <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec7.txt')">dear</a>', says she, turning to her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec7.txt')">husband</a>, 'you may now see the
Stranger that was in the Candle last Night'.</p><p>Soon after this, as they began to talk of Family Affairs, a little Boy
at the lower end of the Table told her, that he was to go into Join-hand
on _Thursday_:</p><p>'Thursday,' says she, 'no, Child, if it please God, you shall not
begin upon Childermas-day; tell your Writing-Master that Friday will
be soon enough'.</p><p>I was reflecting with my self on the Odness of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec7.txt')">Fancy</a>, and wondering
that any <a name="topic30" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec7.txt')">body</a> would establish it as a Rule to lose a Day in every Week.
In the midst of these my Musings she desired me to reach her a little
Salt upon the Point of my Knife, which I did in such a Trepidation and
hurry of Obedience, that I let it drop by the way; at which she
immediately startled, and said it fell towards her. Upon this I looked
very blank; and, observing the Concern of the whole Table, began to
consider my self, with some Confusion, as a Person that had brought a
Disaster upon the Family. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec7.txt')">Lady</a> however recovering her self, after a
little space, said to her Husband with a Sigh,</p><p>'My Dear, Misfortunes never come Single'.</p><p>My <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec7.txt')">Friend</a>, I found, acted but an under Part at his Table, and
being a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec7.txt')">Man</a> of more Goodnature than Understanding, thinks himself
obliged to fall in with all the Passions and Humours of his Yoke-fellow:</p><p>'Do not you remember, Child', says she, 'that the Pidgeon-House fell
the very Afternoon that our careless Wench spilt the Salt upon the
Table?'</p><p>'Yes', says he, 'my Dear, and the next Post brought us an Account of
the Battel of Almanza'. [1]</p><p>The Reader may guess at the figure I made, after having done all this
Mischief. I dispatched my Dinner as soon as I could, with my usual
Taciturnity; when, to my utter Confusion, the Lady seeing me [quitting
[2]] my Knife and Fork, and laying them across one another upon my
Plate, desired me that I would humour her so far as to take them out of
that Figure, and place them side by side. What the Absurdity was which I
had committed I did not know, but I suppose there was some traditionary
Superstition in it; and therefore, in obedience to the Lady of the
House, I disposed of my Knife and Fork in two parallel Lines, which is
the figure I shall always lay them in for the future, though I do not
know any <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec7.txt')">Reason</a> for it.</p><p>It is not difficult for a Man to see that a Person has conceived an
Aversion to him. For my own part, I quickly found, by the Lady's Looks,
that she regarded me as a very odd kind of Fellow, with an unfortunate
Aspect: For which Reason I took my leave immediately after Dinner, and
withdrew to my own Lodgings. Upon my Return home, I fell into a profound
Contemplation on the Evils that attend these superstitious Follies of
Mankind; how they subject us to imaginary Afflictions, and additional
Sorrows, that do not properly come within our Lot. As if the natural
Calamities of Life were not sufficient for it, we turn the most
indifferent Circumstances into Misfortunes, and suffer as much from
trifling Accidents, as from real Evils. I have known the shooting of a
Star spoil a Night's Rest; and have seen a Man in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec7.txt')">Love</a> grow pale and
lose his Appetite, upon the plucking of a Merry-thought. A Screech-Owl
at Midnight has alarmed a Family, more than a Band of Robbers; nay, the
Voice of a Cricket hath struck more Terrour, than the Roaring of a Lion.
There is nothing so inconsiderable [which [3]] may not appear dreadful
to an Imagination that is filled with Omens and Prognosticks. A Rusty
Nail, or a Crooked Pin, shoot up into Prodigies.</p><p>I remember I was once in a mixt Assembly, that was full of Noise and
Mirth, when on a sudden an old <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec7.txt')">Woman</a> unluckily observed there were
thirteen of us in <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec7.txt')">Company</a>. This Remark struck a pannick Terror into
several [who [4]] were present, insomuch that one or two of the Ladies
were going to leave the Room; but a Friend of mine, taking notice that
one of our female Companions was big with Child, affirm'd there were
fourteen in the Room, and that, instead of portending one of the Company
should die, it plainly foretold one of them should be born. Had not my
Friend found this Expedient to break the Omen, I question not but half
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec7.txt')">Women</a> in the Company would have fallen sick that very Night.</p><p>An old Maid, that is troubled with the Vapours, produces <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec7.txt')">infinite</a>
Disturbances of this kind among her Friends and Neighbours. I know a
Maiden Aunt, of a great Family, who is one of these Antiquated _Sybils_,
that forebodes and prophesies from one end of the Year to the other. She
is always seeing Apparitions, and hearing <a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec7.txt')">Death</a>-Watches; and was the
other Day almost frighted out of her Wits by the great House-Dog, that
howled in the Stable at a time when she lay ill of the Tooth-ach. Such
an extravagant Cast of Mind engages Multitudes of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec7.txt')">People</a>, not only in
impertinent Terrors, but in supernumerary Duties of Life, and arises
from that <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec7.txt')">Fear</a> and Ignorance which are natural to the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('30', 'spec7.txt')">Soul</a> of Man. The
Horrour with which we entertain the Thoughts of Death (or indeed of any
future Evil), and the Uncertainty of its Approach, fill a melancholy
Mind with innumerable Apprehensions and Suspicions, and consequently
dispose it to the Observation of such groundless Prodigies and
Predictions. For as it is the chief Concern of Wise-Men, to retrench the
Evils of Life by the Reasonings of Philosophy; it is the Employment of
Fools, to multiply them by the Sentiments of Superstition.</p><p>For my own part, I should be very much troubled were I endowed with this
Divining Quality, though it should inform me truly of every thing that
can befall me. I would not anticipate the Relish of any Happiness, nor
feel the Weight of any Misery, before it actually arrives.</p><p>I know but one way of fortifying my Soul against these gloomy Presages
and Terrours of Mind, and that is, by securing to my self the Friendship
and Protection of that Being, who disposes of Events, and governs
Futurity. He sees, at one View, the whole Thread of my Existence, not
only that Part of it which I have already passed through, but that which
runs forward into all the Depths of Eternity. When I lay me down to
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec7.txt')">Sleep</a>, I recommend my self to his Care; when I <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('45', 'spec7.txt')">awake</a>, I give my self up
to his Direction. Amidst all the Evils that threaten me, I will look up
to him for Help, and question not but he will either avert them, or turn
them to my Advantage. Though I know neither the Time nor the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec7.txt')">Manner</a> of
the Death I am to die, I am not at all sollicitous about it, because I
am sure that he knows them both, and that he will not fail to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec7.txt')">comfort</a>
and support me under them.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Fought April 25 (O.S. 14), 1707, between the English, under
