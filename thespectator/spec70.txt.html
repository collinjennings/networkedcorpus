<p>No. 70.                   Monday, May 21, 1711.                Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Interdum vulgus rectum videt.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
When I travelled, I took a particular Delight in hearing the Songs and
Fables that are come from Father to Son, and are most in Vogue among the
common <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec70.txt')">People</a> of the Countries through which I passed; for it is
impossible that any thing should be universally tasted and approved by a
Multitude, tho' they are only the Rabble of a Nation, which hath not in
it some peculiar Aptness to please and gratify the Mind of Man. Human
Nature is the same in all reasonable Creatures; and whatever falls in
with it, will meet with Admirers amongst Readers of all Qualities and
Conditions. _Molière_, as we are told by Monsieur _Boileau_, used to
read all his Comedies to [an [1]] old Woman [who [2]] was his
Housekeeper, as she sat with him at her Work by the Chimney-Corner; and
could foretel the Success of his Play in the Theatre, from the Reception
it met at his Fire-side: For he tells us the Audience always followed
the old Woman, and never failed to laugh in the same Place. [3]</p><p>I know nothing which more shews the essential and inherent Perfection of
Simplicity of Thought, above that which I <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec70.txt')">call</a> the Gothick <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec70.txt')">Manner</a> in
<a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec70.txt')">Writing</a>, than this, that the first pleases all Kinds of Palates, and the
latter only such as have formed to themselves a wrong artificial Taste
upon little fanciful <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec70.txt')">Authors</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec70.txt')">Writers</a> of Epigram. _<a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec70.txt')">Homer</a>_, _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec70.txt')">Virgil</a>_,
or _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec70.txt')">Milton</a>_, so far as the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec70.txt')">Language</a> of their Poems is understood, will
please a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec70.txt')">Reader</a> of plain common Sense, who would neither relish nor
comprehend an Epigram of _Martial_, or a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec70.txt')">Poem</a> of _Cowley_: So, on the
contrary, an ordinary Song or Ballad that is the Delight of the common
People, cannot fail to please all such Readers as are not unqualified
for the Entertainment by their Affectation or Ignorance; and the Reason
is plain, because the same Paintings of Nature which recommend it to the
most ordinary Reader, will appear Beautiful to the most refined.</p><p>The old Song of _Chevey Chase_ is the favourite Ballad of the common
People of _<a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec70.txt')">England</a>_; and _Ben Johnson_ used to say he had rather have
been the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec70.txt')">Author</a> of it than of all his Works. Sir _Philip Sidney_ in his
'Discourse of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec70.txt')">Poetry</a>' [4] speaks of it in the following <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec70.txt')">Words</a>;</p><p>_I never heard the old Song of_ Piercy _and_ Douglas, _that I found
not my Heart more moved than with a Trumpet; and yet it is sung by
some blind Crowder with no rougher Voice than rude Stile; which being
so evil apparelled in the Dust and Cobweb of that uncivil Age, what
would it work trimmed in the gorgeous Eloquence of_ Pindar?</p><p>For my own part I am so professed an Admirer of this antiquated Song,
that I shall give my Reader a Critick upon it, without any further
Apology for so doing.</p><p>The greatest Modern Criticks have laid it down as a Rule, that an
Heroick Poem should be founded upon some important Precept of Morality,
adapted to the Constitution of the Country in which the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec70.txt')">Poet</a> writes.
_Homer_ and _Virgil_ have formed their Plans in this View. As _Greece_
was a Collection of many Governments, who suffered very much among
themselves, and gave the _Persian_ Emperor, who was their common Enemy,
many Advantages over them by their mutual Jealousies and Animosities,
_Homer_, in order to establish among them an Union, which was so
necessary for their Safety, grounds his Poem upon the Discords of the
several _Grecian_ Princes who were engaged in a Confederacy against an
_Asiatick_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec70.txt')">Prince</a>, and the several Advantages which the Enemy gained by
such their Discords. At the Time the Poem we are now treating of was
written, the Dissentions of the Barons, who were then so many petty
Princes, ran very high, whether they quarrelled among themselves, or
with their Neighbours, and produced unspeakable Calamities to the
Country: [5] The Poet, to deter Men from such unnatural Contentions,
describes a bloody Battle and dreadful Scene of Death, occasioned by the
mutual Feuds which reigned in the Families of an _English_ and _Scotch_
Nobleman: That he designed this for the Instruction of his Poem, we may
learn from his four last Lines, in which, after the Example of the
modern Tragedians, he draws from it a Precept for the Benefit of his
Readers.</p><p>_God save the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec70.txt')">King</a>, and bless the Land
In Plenty, Joy, and Peace;
And grant henceforth that foul Debate
'Twixt Noblemen may cease._</p><p>
The next Point observed by the greatest Heroic Poets, hath been to
celebrate Persons and Actions which do Honour to their Country: Thus
_Virgil's_ Hero was the Founder of _Rome_, _Homer's_ a Prince of
_Greece_; and for this Reason _Valerius Flaccus_ and _Statius_, who were
both _Romans_, might be justly derided for having chosen the Expedition
of the _Golden Fleece_, and the _Wars of Thebes_ for the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec70.txt')">Subjects</a> of
their Epic Writings.</p><p>The Poet before us has not only found out an Hero in his own Country,
but raises the Reputation of it by several beautiful Incidents. The
_English_ are the first [who [6]] take the Field, and the last [who [7]]
quit it. The _English_ bring only Fifteen hundred to the Battle, the
_Scotch_ Two thousand. The _English_ keep the Field with Fifty three:
The _Scotch_ retire with Fifty five: All the rest on each side being
slain in Battle. But the most remarkable Circumstance of this <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec70.txt')">kind</a>, is
the different Manner in which the _Scotch_ and _English_ Kings [receive
[8]] the News of this Fight, and of the great Men's Deaths who commanded
in it.</p><p>_This News was brought to_ Edinburgh,
_Where_ Scotland's _King did reign,
That brave Earl_ Douglas _suddenly
Was with an Arrow slain.</p><p>O heavy News, King James did say,_
Scotland _can Witness be,
I have not any Captain more
Of such Account as he.</p><p>Like Tydings to King_ Henry _came
Within as short a Space,
That_ Piercy _of_ Northumberland
_Was slain in_ Chevy-Chase.</p><p>_Now God be with him, said our King,
Sith 'twill no better be,
I trust I have within my Realm
Five hundred as good as he.</p><p>Yet shall not_ Scot _nor_ Scotland _say
But I will Vengeance take,
And be revenged on them all
For brave Lord_ Piercy's _Sake.</p><p>This Vow full well the King performed
After on_ Humble-down,
_In one Day fifty Knights were slain,
With Lords of great Renown.</p><p>And of the rest of small Account
Did many Thousands dye,_ &c.</p><p>At the same time that our Poet shews a laudable Partiality to his
Countrymen, he represents the _Scots_ after a Manner not unbecoming so
bold and brave a People.</p><p>_Earl Douglas on a milk-white Steed,
Most like a Baron bold,
Rode foremost of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec70.txt')">Company</a>
Whose Armour shone like Gold_.</p><p>His Sentiments and Actions are every Way suitable to an Hero. One of us
two, says he, must dye: I am an Earl as well as your self, so that you
can have no Pretence for refusing the Combat: However, says he, 'tis
Pity, and indeed would be a Sin, that so many innocent Men should perish
for our sakes, rather let you and I end our Quarrel [in single Fight.
[9]]</p><p>_Ere thus I will out-braved be,
One of us two shall dye;
I know thee well, an Earl thou art,
Lord Piercy, so am I.</p><p>But trust me_, Piercy, _Pity it were,
And great Offence, to kill
Any of these our harmless Men,
For they have done no Ill.</p><p>Let thou and I the Battle try,
And set our Men aside;
Accurst be he, Lord_ Piercy _said,
By whom this is deny'd_.</p><p>When these brave Men had distinguished themselves in the Battle and a
single Combat with each other, in the Midst of a generous Parly, full of
heroic Sentiments, the _Scotch_ Earl falls; and with his dying Words
encourages his Men to revenge his Death, representing to them, as the
most bitter Circumstance of it, that his Rival saw him fall.</p><p>_With that there came an Arrow keen
Out of an_ English _Bow,
Which struck Earl_ Douglas _to the Heart
A deep and deadly Blow.</p><p>Who never spoke more Words than these,
Fight on, my merry Men all,
For why, my Life is at an End,
Lord_ Piercy sees _my Fall.</p><p>_Merry Men_, in the Language of those Times, is no more than a cheerful
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec70.txt')">Word</a> for Companions and Fellow-Soldiers. A Passage in the Eleventh Book
of _Virgil's Æneid_ is very much to be admired, where _Camilla_ in her
last Agonies instead of weeping over the Wound she had received, as one
might have expected from a Warrior of her Sex, considers only (like the
Hero of whom we are now speaking) how the Battle should be continued
after her Death.</p><p>_Tum sic exspirans_, &c.</p><p>_A gathering Mist overclouds her chearful Eyes;
And from her Cheeks the rosie Colour flies.
Then turns to her, whom, of her Female Train,
She trusted most, and thus she speaks with Pain.
Acca, 'tis past! He swims before my Sight,
Inexorable Death; and claims his Right.
Bear my last Words to Turnus, fly with Speed,
And bid him timely to my Charge succeed;
Repel the Trojans, and the Town relieve:
Farewel_ ...</p><p>_Turnus_ did not die in so heroic a Manner; tho' our Poet seems to
have had his Eye upon _Turnus's_ Speech in the last <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec70.txt')">Verse</a>,</p><p>_Lord Piercy sees my Fall.
... Vicisti, et victum tendere palmas
Ausonii videre_ ...</p><p>Earl _Piercy's_ Lamentation over his Enemy is generous, beautiful, and
passionate; I must only caution the Reader not to let the Simplicity of
the Stile, which one may well pardon in so old a Poet, prejudice him
against the Greatness of the Thought.</p><p>_Then leaving Life, Earl Piercy took
The dead Man by the Hand,
And said, Earl Douglas, for thy Life
Would I had lost my Land.</p><p>O Christ! my very heart doth bleed
With Sorrow for thy Sake;
For sure a more renowned Knight
Mischance did never take_.</p><p>That beautiful Line, _Taking the dead Man by the Hand_, will put the
Reader in mind of _Æneas's_ <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec70.txt')">Behaviour</a> towards _Lausus_, whom he himself
had slain as he came to the Rescue of his aged Father.</p><p>_At vero ut vultum vidit morientis, et ora,
Ora modis Anchisiades, pallentia miris;
Ingemuit, miserans graviter, dextramque tetendit, &c.</p><p>The pious Prince beheld young Lausus dead;
He grieved, he wept; then grasped his Hand, and said,
Poor hapless Youth! What Praises can be paid
To worth so great ..._</p><p>I shall take another Opportunity to consider the other Part of this old
Song.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: a little]</p><p>

the children of the Comedians, read his pieces to them, and corrected
passages at which they did not show themselves to be amused.]</p><p>

[Footnote 5: The author of Chevy Chase was not contemporary with the
dissensions of the Barons, even if the ballad of the 'Hunting of the
Cheviot' was a celebration of the Battle of Otterbourne, fought in 1388,
some 30 miles from Newcastle. The battle of Chevy Chase, between the
Percy and the Douglas, was fought in Teviotdale, and the ballad which
moved Philip Sidney's heart was written in the fifteenth century. It may
have referred to a Battle of Pepperden, fought near the Cheviot Hills,
between the Earl of Northumberland and Earl William Douglas of Angus, in
1436. The ballad quoted by Addison is not that of which Sidney spoke,
but a version of it, written after Sidney's death, and after the best
plays of Shakespeare had been written.]</p><p>
