<p>No. 71.                Tuesday, May 22, 1711.                   Steele.</p><p></p><p>'... Scribere jussit Amor.'</p><p>Ovid.</p><p>
The entire Conquest of our Passions is so difficult a Work, that they
who despair of it should think of a less difficult Task, and only
attempt to Regulate them. But there is a third thing which may
contribute not only to the Ease, but also to the Pleasure of our Life;
and that is refining our Passions to a greater Elegance, than we receive
them from Nature. When the <a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec71.txt')">Passion</a> is <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec71.txt')">Love</a>, this Work is performed in
innocent, though rude and uncultivated Minds, by the mere Force and
Dignity of the Object. There are Forms which naturally create Respect in
the Beholders, and at once Inflame and Chastise the Imagination. Such an
Impression as this gives an immediate Ambition to deserve, in order to
please. This Cause and Effect are beautifully described by Mr.
_Dryden_ in the Fable of _Cymon_ and _Iphigenia_. After
he has represented _Cymon_ so stupid, that</p><p>_He Whistled as he went, for want of Thought_,</p><p>he makes him fall into the following Scene, and shews its Influence upon
him so excellently, that it appears as Natural as Wonderful.</p><p>_It happen'd on a Summer's Holiday,
That to the Greenwood-shade he took his Way;
His Quarter-staff, which he cou'd ne'er forsake,
Hung half before, and half behind his Back.
He trudg'd along unknowing what he sought,
And whistled as he went, for want of Thought.</p><p>By Chance conducted, or by Thirst constrain'd,
The deep recesses of the Grove he gain'd;
Where in a Plain, defended by the Wood,
Crept thro' the matted Grass a Crystal Flood,
By which an Alabaster Fountain stood:
And on the Margin of the Fount was laid,
(Attended by her Slaves) a sleeping Maid,
Like_ Dian, _and her Nymphs, when, tir'd with Sport,
To rest by cool_ Eurotas _they resort:
The Dame herself the Goddess well expressed,
Not more distinguished by her Purple Vest,
Than by the charming Features of her Face,
And even in Slumber a superior Grace:
Her comely Limbs composed with decent Care,
Her Body shaded with a slight Cymarr;
Her Bosom to the View was only bare_:[1]</p><p>...</p><p>_The fanning Wind upon her Bosom blows,
To meet the fanning  Wind the Bosom rose;
The fanning Wind and purling Streams continue her Repose.</p><p>The Fool of Nature stood with stupid Eyes
And gaping Mouth, that testify'd Surprize,
Fix'd on her Face, nor could remove his Sight,
New as he was to Love, and Novice in Delight:
Long mute he stood, and leaning on his Staff,
His Wonder witness'd with an Idiot Laugh;
Then would have spoke, but by his glimmering Sense
First found his want of Words, and fear'd Offence:
Doubted for what he was he should be known,
By his Clown-Accent, and his <a name="topic27" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec71.txt')">Country</a> Tone_.</p><p>
But lest this fine Description should be excepted against, as the
Creation of that great Master, Mr. _Dryden_, and not an Account of what
has really ever happened in the World; I shall give you, _verbatim_, the
Epistle of an enamoured Footman in the Country to his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec71.txt')">Mistress</a>. [2]
Their Sirnames shall not be inserted, because their Passion demands a
greater Respect than is due to their Quality. _James_ is Servant in a
great Family, and Elizabeth waits upon the Daughter of one as numerous,
some Miles off of her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec71.txt')">Lover</a>. _James_, before he beheld _Betty_, was vain
of his Strength, a rough Wrestler, and quarrelsome Cudgel-Player;
_Betty_ a Publick Dancer at Maypoles, a Romp at Stool-Ball: He always
following idle <a name="topic25" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec71.txt')">Women</a>, she playing among the Peasants: He a Country
Bully, she a Country Coquet. But Love has made her constantly in her
Mistress's Chamber, where the young <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec71.txt')">Lady</a> gratifies a secret Passion of
her own, by making _Betty_ talk of _James_; and _James_ is become a
constant Waiter near his Master's Apartment, in reading, as well as he
can, Romances. I cannot learn who _Molly_ is, who it seems walked Ten
Mile to carry the angry Message, which gave Occasion to what follows.</p><p>To _ELIZABETH_ ...</p><p>_My <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec71.txt')">Dear</a> Betty_, May 14, 1711.</p><p>Remember your bleeding Lover,
who lies bleeding at the ...
_Where two beginning Paps were scarcely spy'd,
For yet their Places were but signify'd_.</p><p>Wounds _Cupid_ made with the Arrows he borrowed at the Eyes of _Venus_,
which is your <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec71.txt')">sweet</a> Person.</p><p>Nay more, with the Token you sent me for my Love and Service offered
to your sweet Person; which was your base Respects to my ill
Conditions; when alas! there is no ill Conditions in me, but quite
contrary; all Love and Purity, especially to your sweet Person; but
all this I take as a Jest.</p><p>But the sad and dismal News which _Molly_ brought me, struck me to the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec71.txt')">Heart</a>, which was, it seems, and is your ill Conditions for my Love and
Respects to you.</p><p>For she told me, if I came Forty times to you, you would not <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec71.txt')">speak</a>
with me, which Words I am sure is a great Grief to me.</p><p>Now, my Dear, if I may not be permitted to your sweet <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec71.txt')">Company</a>, and to
have the Happiness of speaking with your sweet Person, I beg the
Favour of you to accept of this my secret Mind and Thoughts, which
hath so long lodged in my Breast; the which if you do not accept, I
believe will go nigh to break my Heart.</p><p>For indeed, my Dear, I Love you above all the Beauties I ever saw in
all my Life.</p><p>The young Gentleman, and my Masters Daughter, the _Londoner_ that is
come down to marry her, sat in the Arbour most part of last Night. Oh!
dear _Betty_, must the Nightingales sing to those who marry for Mony,
and not to us true <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec71.txt')">Lovers</a>! Oh my dear _Betty_, that we could meet this
Night where we used to do in the Wood!</p><p>Now, my Dear, if I may not have the Blessing of kissing your sweet
Lips, I beg I may have the Happiness of kissing your fair Hand, with a
few Lines from your dear self, presented by whom you please or think
fit. I believe, if Time would permit me, I could write all Day; but
the Time being short, and Paper little, no more from your
never-failing Lover till Death, James ...</p><p>Poor James! Since his Time and Paper were so short; I, that have more
than I can use well of both, will put the Sentiments of his kind Letter
(the Stile of which seems to be confused with Scraps he had got in
hearing and reading what he did not understand) into what he meant to
express.</p><p>Dear Creature, Can you then neglect him who has forgot all his
Recreations and Enjoyments, to pine away his Life in thinking of you?</p><p>When I do so, you appear more amiable to me than _Venus_ does in the
most <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('27', 'spec71.txt')">beautiful</a> Description that ever was made of her. All this
Kindness you return with an Accusation, that I do not love you: But
the contrary is so manifest, that I cannot think you in earnest. But
the Certainty given me in your Message by _Molly_, that you do not
love me, is what robs me of all Comfort. She says you will not see me:
If you can have so much Cruelty, at least write to me, that I may kiss
the Impression made by your fair Hand. I love you above all things,
and, in my Condition, what you look upon with Indifference is to me
the most exquisite Pleasure or Pain. Our young Lady, and a fine
Gentleman from _London_, who are to marry for mercenary Ends, walk
about our Gardens, and hear the Voice of Evening Nightingales, as if
for Fashion-sake they courted those Solitudes, because they have heard
Lovers do so. Oh _Betty!_ could I hear these Rivulets murmur, and
Birds sing while you stood near me, how little sensible should I be
that we are both Servants, that there is anything on Earth above us.
Oh! I could write to you as long as I love you, till Death it self.</p><p>_JAMES_.</p><p>_N. B._ By the Words _Ill-Conditions_, James means in a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec71.txt')">Woman</a>
_Coquetry_, in a Man _Inconstancy_.</p><p>R.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: The next couplet Steele omits:]</p><p>
[Footnote 2: James Hirst, a servant to the Hon. Edward Wortley (who was
familiar with Steele, and a close <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec71.txt')">friend</a> of Addison's), by mistake gave
to his master, with a parcel of letters, one that he had himself written
to his sweetheart. Mr. Wortley opened it, read it, and would not return
it.</p><p>'No, James,' he said, 'you shall be a great man. This letter must
appear in the Spectator.'</p><p>And so it did. The end of the love story is that Betty died when on the
point of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec71.txt')">marriage</a> to James, who, out of love to her, <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('25', 'spec71.txt')">married</a> her
sister.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
