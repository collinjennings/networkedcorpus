<p>No. 74.               Friday, May 25, 1711.                 Addison.</p><p></p><p>'... Pendent opera interrupta ...'</p><p>Virg.</p><p></p><p>In my last _Monday's_ Paper I gave some general Instances of those
beautiful Strokes which please the <a name="topic40" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('40', 'spec74.txt')">Reader</a> in the old Song of
_Chevey-Chase_; I shall here, according to my Promise, be more
particular, and shew that the Sentiments in that Ballad are extremely
natural and poetical, and full of [the [1]] majestick Simplicity which
we admire in the greatest of the ancient Poets: For which Reason I shall
quote several Passages of it, in which the Thought is altogether the
same with what we meet in several Passages of the _Æneid_; not that I
would infer from thence, that the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('40', 'spec74.txt')">Poet</a> (whoever he was) proposed to
himself any Imitation of those Passages, but that he was directed to
them in general by the same <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec74.txt')">Kind</a> of Poetical <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec74.txt')">Genius</a>, and by the same
Copyings after Nature.</p><p>Had this old Song been filled with Epigrammatical Turns and Points of
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec74.txt')">Wit</a>, it might perhaps have pleased the wrong Taste of some Readers; but
it would never have become the Delight of the common People, nor have
warmed the Heart of Sir _Philip Sidney_ like the Sound of a Trumpet; it
is only Nature that can have this Effect, and please those Tastes which
are the most unprejudiced or the most refined. I must however beg leave
to dissent from so great an Authority as that of Sir _Philip Sidney_, in
the Judgment which he has passed as to the rude Stile and evil Apparel
of this antiquated Song; for there are several Parts in it where not
only the Thought but the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec74.txt')">Language</a> is majestick, and the Numbers
[sonorous; [2]] at least, the _Apparel_ is much more _gorgeous_ than
many of the Poets made use of in Queen _Elizabeth's_ Time, as the Reader
will see in several of the following Quotations.</p><p>What can be greater than either the Thought or the Expression in that
Stanza,</p><p>_To drive the Deer with Hound and Horn
Earl_ Piercy _took his Way;
The Child may rue that was unborn
The Hunting of that Day!_</p><p>This way of considering the Misfortunes which this Battle would bring
upon Posterity, not only on those who were born immediately after the
Battle and lost their Fathers in it, but on those also who [perished
[3]] in future Battles which [took their rise [4]] from this Quarrel of
the two Earls, is wonderfully beautiful, and conformable to the Way of
Thinking among the ancient Poets.</p><p>'Audiet pugnas vilio parentum</p><p>Rara juventus'.</p><p>Hor.</p><p>What can be more sounding and poetical, resemble more the majestic
Simplicity of the Ancients, than the following Stanzas?</p><p>_The stout Earl of_ Northumberland
_A Vow to God did make,
His Pleasure in the_ Scotish _Woods
Three Summers Days to take.</p><p>With fifteen hundred Bowmen bold,
All chosen Men of Might,
Who knew full well, in time of Need,
To aim their Shafts aright.</p><p>The Hounds ran swiftly thro' the Woods
The nimble Deer to take,
And with their Cries the Hills and Dales
An Eccho shrill did make_.</p><p>
... Vocat ingenti Clamore Cithseron
Taygetique canes, domitrixque Epidaurus equorum:
Et vox assensu nemorum ingeminata remugit.</p><p>
_Lo, yonder doth Earl_ Dowglas _come,
His Men in Armour bright;
Full twenty Hundred_ Scottish _Spears,
All marching in our Sight_.</p><p>_All Men of pleasant Tividale,
Fast by the River Tweed, etc_.</p><p>
The Country of the _Scotch_ Warriors, described in these two last
Verses, has a fine romantick Situation, and affords a couple of smooth
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec74.txt')">Words</a> for <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec74.txt')">Verse</a>. If the Reader compares the forgoing six Lines of the
Song with the following Latin Verses, he will see how much they are
written in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('40', 'spec74.txt')">Spirit</a> of _<a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec74.txt')">Virgil</a>_.</p><p>_Adversi campo apparent, hastasque reductis
Protendunt longe dextris; et spicula vibrant;
Quique altum Preneste viri, quique arva Gabinæ
Junonis, gelidumque Anienem, et roscida rivis
Hernica saxa colunt: ... <a name="topic15" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec74.txt')">qui</a> rosea rura Velini,
Qui Terticæ horrentes rupes, montemque Severum,
Casperiamque colunt, Forulosque et flumen Himellæ:
Qui Tiberim Fabarimque bibunt_ ...</p><p>But to proceed.</p><p>_Earl_ Dowglas _on a milk-white Steed,
Most like a Baron bold,
Rode foremost of the Company,
Whose Armour shone like Gold._</p><p>Turnus ut antevolans tardum precesserat agmen, &c. Vidisti, quo Turnus
equo, quibus ibat in armis Aureus ...</p><p>_Our_ English _Archers bent their Bows
Their Hearts were good and true;
At the first Flight of Arrows sent,
Full threescore_ Scots _they slew.</p><p>They clos'd full fast on ev'ry side,
No Slackness there was found.
And many a gallant Gentleman
Lay gasping on the Ground.</p><p>With that there came an Arrow keen
Out of an_ English _Bow,
Which struck Earl_ Dowglas _to the Heart
A deep and deadly Blow._</p><p>Æneas was wounded after the same Manner by an unknown Hand in the midst
of a Parly.</p><p>_Has inter voces, media inter talia verba,
Ecce viro stridens alis allapsa sagitta <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec74.txt')">est</a>,
Incertum <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('15', 'spec74.txt')">qu</a>â pulsa manu ...</p><p>But of all the descriptive Parts of this Song, there are none more
beautiful than the four following Stanzas which have a great Force and
Spirit in them, and are filled with very natural Circumstances. The
Thought in the third Stanza was never touched by any other Poet, and is
such an one as would have shined in _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec74.txt')">Homer</a>_ or in _Virgil_.</p><p>So thus did both those Nobles die,
Whose Courage none could stain:
An _English_ Archer then perceived
The noble Earl was slain.</p><p>He had a Bow bent in his Hand,
Made of a trusty Tree,
An Arrow of a Cloth-yard long
Unto the Head drew he.</p><p>Against Sir _Hugh Montgomery_
So right his Shaft he set,
The Gray-goose Wing that was thereon
In his Heart-Blood was wet.</p><p>This Fight did last from Break of Day
Till setting of the Sun;
For when they rung the Evening Bell
The Battle scarce was done.</p><p>One may observe likewise, that in the Catalogue of the Slain the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec74.txt')">Author</a>
has followed the Example of the greatest ancient Poets, not only in
giving a long List of the Dead, but by diversifying it with little
Characters of particular Persons.</p><p>And with Earl _Dowglas_ there was slain
Sir _Hugh Montgomery_,
Sir _Charles Carrel_, that from the Field
One Foot would never fly:</p><p>Sir _Charles Murrel_ of Ratcliff too,
His Sister's Son was he;
Sir _David Lamb_, so well esteem'd,
Yet saved could not be.</p><p>The familiar Sound in these Names destroys the Majesty of the
Description; for this Reason I do not mention this Part of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('40', 'spec74.txt')">Poem</a> but
to shew the natural Cast of Thought which appears in it, as the two last
Verses look almost like a Translation of _Virgil_.</p><p>... Cadit et Ripheus justissimus unus
Qui fuit in Teucris et servantissimus æqui,
Diis aliter visum est ...</p><p>In the Catalogue of the _English_ [who [5]] fell, _Witherington's_
Behaviour is in the same manner particularized very artfully, as the
Reader is prepared for it by that Account which is given of him in the
Beginning of the Battle [; though I am satisfied your little Buffoon
Readers (who have seen that Passage ridiculed in _Hudibras_) will not be
able to take the Beauty of it: For which Reason I dare not so much as
quote it].</p><p>Then stept a gallant Squire forth,
_Witherington_ was his Name,
Who said, I would not have it told
To _Henry_ our King for Shame,</p><p>That e'er my Captain fought on Foot,
And I stood looking on.</p><p>We meet with the same Heroic Sentiments in _Virgil_.</p><p>Non pudet, O Rutuli, cunctis pro talibus unam
Objectare animam? numerone an viribus æqui
Non sumus ... ?</p><p>What can be more natural or more moving than the Circumstances in which
he describes the Behaviour of those Women who had lost their Husbands on
this fatal Day?</p><p>Next Day did many Widows come
Their Husbands to bewail;
They washed their Wounds in brinish Tears,
But all would not prevail.</p><p>Their Bodies bath'd in purple Blood,
They bore with them away;
They kiss'd them dead a thousand Times,
When they were clad in Clay.</p><p>Thus we see how the Thoughts of this Poem, which naturally arise from
the Subject, are always simple, and sometimes exquisitely noble; that
the Language is often very sounding, and that the whole is written with
a true poetical Spirit.</p><p>If this Song had been written in the _Gothic_ Manner, which is the
Delight of all our little Wits, whether <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec74.txt')">Writers</a> or Readers, it would not
have hit the Taste of so many Ages, and have pleased the Readers of all
Ranks and Conditions. I shall only beg Pardon for such a Profusion of
_Latin_ Quotations; which I should not have made use of, but that I
feared my own Judgment would have looked too singular on such a Subject,
had not I supported it by the Practice and Authority of _Virgil_.</p><p>C.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: that]</p><p>
