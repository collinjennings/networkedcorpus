<p>No. 75.               Saturday, May 26, 1711.                  Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Omnis Aristippum decuit color, et status, et res.'</p><p>Hor.</p><p>
It was with some Mortification that I suffered the Raillery of a Fine
<a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec75.txt')">Lady</a> of my Acquaintance, for calling, in one of my Papers, _Dorimant_ a
Clown. She was so unmerciful as to take Advantage of my invincible
Taciturnity, and on that occasion, with <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec75.txt')">great</a> Freedom to consider the
Air, the Height, the Face, the Gesture of him who could pretend to judge
so arrogantly of Gallantry. She is full of Motion, Janty and lively in
her Impertinence, and one of those that commonly pass, among the
Ignorant, for Persons who have a great deal of Humour. She had the Play
of Sir _Fopling_ in her Hand, and after she had said it was happy for
her there was not so charming a Creature as _Dorimant_ now living, she
began with a Theatrical Air and Tone of Voice to Read, by way of Triumph
over me, some of his Speeches. _'Tis she, that lovely Hair, that easy
Shape, those wanton Eyes, and all those melting Charms about her Mouth,
which_ Medley _spoke of; I'll follow the Lottery, and put in for a Prize
with my <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec75.txt')">Friend</a>_ Bellair.</p><p>_In Love the Victors from the Vanquish'd fly;
They fly that wound, and they pursue that dye,</p><p>Then turning over the Leaves, she reads alternately, and speaks,</p><p>_And you and_ Loveit _to her Cost shall find
I fathom all the Depths of Womankind_.</p><p>Oh the Fine Gentleman! But here, continues she, is the Passage I admire
most, where he begins to Teize _Loveit_, and mimick Sir _Fopling_: Oh
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec75.txt')">pretty</a> Satyr, in his resolving to be a Coxcomb to please, since
Noise and Nonsense have such powerful Charms!</p><p>_I, that I may Successful prove,
Transform my self to what you love_.</p><p>Then how like a Man of the Town, so Wild and Gay is that</p><p>_The Wife will find a Diff'rence in our Fate,
You wed a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec75.txt')">Woman</a>, I a good Estate_.</p><p>It would have been a very wild Endeavour for a Man of my Temper to offer
any Opposition to so nimble a Speaker as my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec75.txt')">Fair</a> Enemy is; but her
Discourse gave me very many Reflections, when I had left her <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec75.txt')">Company</a>.
Among others, I could not but consider, with some Attention, the false
Impressions the generality (the Fair <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec75.txt')">Sex</a> more especially) have of what
should be intended, when they say a _Fine Gentleman_; and could not help
revolving that Subject in my Thoughts, and settling, as it were, an Idea
of that Character in my own Imagination.</p><p>No Man ought to have the Esteem of the rest of the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec75.txt')">World</a>, for any
Actions which are disagreeable to those Maxims which prevail, as the
Standards of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec75.txt')">Behaviour</a>, in the Country wherein he lives. What is
opposite to the eternal Rules of Reason and good Sense, must be excluded
from any Place in the Carriage of a Well-bred Man. I did not, I confess,
explain myself enough on this Subject, when I called _Dorimant_ a Clown,
and made it an Instance of it, that he called the _Orange Wench_,
_Double Tripe_: I should have shewed, that Humanity obliges a Gentleman
to give no Part of Humankind Reproach, for what they, whom they
Reproach, may possibly have in Common with the most Virtuous and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec75.txt')">Worthy</a>
amongst us. When a Gentleman speaks Coarsly, he has dressed himself
Clean to no purpose: The Cloathing of our Minds certainly ought to be
regarded before that of our Bodies. To betray in a Man's Talk a
corrupted Imagination, is a much greater Offence against the
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec75.txt')">Conversation</a> of Gentlemen, than any Negligence of Dress imaginable. But
this Sense of the Matter is so far from being received among <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec75.txt')">People</a> even
of Condition, that _Vocifer_ passes for a fine Gentleman. He is Loud,
Haughty, Gentle, Soft, Lewd, and Obsequious by turns, just as a little
Understanding and great Impudence prompt him at the present Moment. He
passes among the silly Part of our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec75.txt')">Women</a> for a Man of Wit, because he is
generally in Doubt. He contradicts with a Shrug, and confutes with a
certain Sufficiency, in professing such and such a Thing is above his
Capacity. What makes his Character the pleasanter is, that he is a
professed Deluder of Women; and because the empty Coxcomb has no Regard
to any thing that is of it self Sacred and Inviolable, I have heard an
unmarried Lady of Fortune say, It is pity so fine a Gentleman as
_Vocifer_ is so great an Atheist. The Crowds of such inconsiderable
Creatures that infest all Places of Assembling, every Reader will have
in his Eye from his own Observation; but would it not be worth
considering what sort of Figure a Man who formed himself upon those
Principles among us, which are <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec75.txt')">agreeable</a> to the Dictates of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec75.txt')">Honour</a> and
Religion, would make in the familiar and ordinary Occurrences of Life?</p><p>I hardly have observed any one fill his several Duties of Life better
than _Ignotus_. All the under Parts of his Behaviour and such as are
exposed to common Observation, have their Rise in him from great and
noble Motives. A firm and unshaken Expectation of another Life, makes
him become this; Humanity and Good-nature, fortified by the Sense of
Virtue, has the same Effect upon him, as the Neglect of all Goodness has
upon many others. Being firmly established in all Matters of Importance,
that certain Inattention which makes Men's Actions look easie appears in
him with greater <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec75.txt')">Beauty</a>: By a thorough Contempt of little Excellencies,
he is perfectly Master of them. This Temper of Mind leaves him under no
Necessity of Studying his Air, and he has this peculiar Distinction,
that his Negligence is unaffected.</p><p>He that can work himself into a Pleasure in considering this Being as an
uncertain one, and think to reap an Advantage by its Discontinuance, is
in a fair way of doing all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec75.txt')">things</a> with a graceful Unconcern, and
Gentleman-like Ease. Such a one does not behold his Life as a short,
transient, perplexing State, made up of trifling Pleasures, and great
Anxieties; but sees it in quite another Light; his Griefs are Momentary,
and his Joys Immortal. Reflection upon Death is not a gloomy and sad
Thought of Resigning every Thing that he Delights in, but it is a short
Night followed by an endless Day. What I would here contend for is, that
the more Virtuous the Man is, the nearer he will naturally be to the
Character of Genteel and Agreeable. A Man whose Fortune is Plentiful,
shews an Ease in his Countenance, and Confidence in his Behaviour, which
he that is under Wants and Difficulties cannot assume. It is thus with
the State of the Mind; he that governs his Thoughts with the everlasting
Rules of Reason and Sense, must have something so inexpressibly Graceful
in his Words and Actions, that every Circumstance must become him. The
Change of Persons or Things around him do not at all alter his
Situation, but he looks disinterested in the Occurrences with which
others are distracted, because the greatest Purpose of his Life is to
maintain an Indifference both to it and all its Enjoyments. In a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec75.txt')">word</a>,
to be a Fine Gentleman, is to be a Generous and a Brave Man. What can
make a Man so much in constant Good-humour and Shine, as we <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec75.txt')">call</a> it,
than to be supported by what can never fail him, and to believe that
whatever happens to him was the best thing that could possibly befal
him, or else he on whom it depends would not have permitted it to have
befallen him at all?</p><p>R.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
