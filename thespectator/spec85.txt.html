<p>No. 85.                 Thursday, June 7, 1711.                 Addison.</p><p></p><p>'Interdum speciosa locis, morataque recte

It is the Custom of the _Mahometans_, if they see any printed or written
Paper upon the Ground, to take it up and lay it aside carefully, as not
knowing but it may contain some Piece of their _Alcoran_. I must confess
I have so much of the _Mussulman_ in me, That I cannot forbear looking
into every printed Paper which comes in my Way, under whatsoever
despicable Circumstances it may appear; for as no mortal <a name="topic24" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec85.txt')">Author</a>, in the
ordinary Fate and Vicissitude of Things, knows to what Use his Works
may, some time or other, be applied, a Man may often meet with very
celebrated Names in a Paper of Tobacco. I have lighted my Pipe more than
once with the Writings of a Prelate; and know a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec85.txt')">Friend</a> of mine, who, for
these several Years, has converted the Essays of a Man of Quality into a
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec85.txt')">kind</a> of Fringe for his Candlesticks. I remember in particular, after
having read over a <a name="topic7" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec85.txt')">Poem</a> of an Eminent Author on a Victory, I met with
several Fragments of it upon the next rejoicing Day, which had been
employ'd in Squibs and Crackers, and by that means celebrated its
Subject in a double Capacity. I once met with a Page of Mr. _Baxter_
under a _Christmas_ Pye. Whether or no the Pastry-Cook had made use of
it through Chance or Waggery, for the Defence of that superstitious
_Viande_, I know not; but upon the Perusal of it, I conceived so good an
Idea of the Author's Piety, that I bought the whole Book. I have often
profited by these accidental Readings, and have sometimes found very
Curious Pieces, that are either out of Print, or not to be met with in
the Shops of our _London Booksellers_. For this Reason, when my Friends
take a Survey of my Library, they are very much surprised to find, upon
the Shelf of Folios, two long Band-Boxes standing upright among my
Books, till I let them see that they are both of them lined with deep
Erudition and abstruse Literature. I might likewise mention a
Paper-Kite, from which I have received great Improvement; and a
Hat-Case, which I would not exchange for all the Beavers in
_Great-Britain_. This my inquisitive Temper, or rather impertinent
<a name="topic32" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec85.txt')">Humour</a> of prying into all Sorts of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec85.txt')">Writing</a>, with my natural Aversion to
Loquacity, give me a good deal of Employment when I enter any House in
the Country; for I cannot for my Heart leave a Room, before I have
thoroughly studied the Walls of it, and examined the several printed
Papers which are usually pasted upon them. The last Piece that I met
with upon this Occasion gave me a most exquisite Pleasure. My <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec85.txt')">Reader</a>
will think I am not serious, when I acquaint him that the Piece I am
going to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec85.txt')">speak</a> of was the old Ballad of the _Two Children in the Wood_,
which is one of the darling Songs of the common <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec85.txt')">People</a>, and has been the
Delight of most _Englishmen_ in some Part of their Age.</p><p>This Song is a plain simple Copy of Nature, destitute of the Helps and
Ornaments of Art. The Tale of it is a pretty Tragical Story, and pleases
for no other Reason but because it is a Copy of Nature. There is even a
despicable Simplicity in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec85.txt')">Verse</a>; and yet because the Sentiments
appear genuine and unaffected, they are able to move the Mind of the
most polite Reader with Inward Meltings of Humanity and Compassion. The
Incidents grow out of the Subject, and are such as [are the most proper
to excite Pity; for [1]] which Reason the whole Narration has something
in it very moving, notwithstanding the Author of it (whoever he was) has
deliver'd it in such an abject Phrase and Poorness of Expression, that
the quoting any part of it would look like a Design of turning it into
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('32', 'spec85.txt')">Ridicule</a>. But though the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec85.txt')">Language</a> is mean, the Thoughts [, as I have
before said,] from one end to the other are [natural, [2]] and therefore
cannot fail to please those who are not Judges of Language, or those
who, notwithstanding they are Judges of Language, have a [true [3]] and
unprejudiced Taste of Nature. The Condition, Speech, and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec85.txt')">Behaviour</a> of
the dying Parents, with the Age, Innocence, and Distress of the
Children, are set forth in such tender Circumstances, that it is
impossible for a [Reader of common Humanity [4]] not to be affected with
them. As for the Circumstance of the _Robin-red-breast_, it is indeed a
little Poetical Ornament; and to shew [the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec85.txt')">Genius</a> of the Author [5]]
amidst all his Simplicity, it is just the same kind of Fiction which one
of the greatest of the _Latin_ Poets has made use of upon a parallel
Occasion; I mean that Passage in _Horace_, where he describes himself
when he was a Child, fallen asleep in a desart Wood, and covered with
Leaves by the Turtles that took pity on him.</p><p>Me fabulosa Vulture in Apulo,
Altricis extra limen Apuliæ,
Ludo fatigatumque somno
Fronde novâ puerum palumbes
Texere ...</p><p>I have heard that the late Lord _Dorset_, who had the greatest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec85.txt')">Wit</a>
temper'd with the greatest [Candour, [6]] and was one of the finest
Criticks as well as the best Poets of his Age, had a numerous collection
of old _English_ Ballads, and took a particular Pleasure in the Reading
of them. I can affirm the same of Mr. _Dryden_, and know several of the
most refined <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('24', 'spec85.txt')">Writers</a> of our present Age who are of the same Humour.</p><p>I might likewise refer my Reader to _Moliere's_ Thoughts on this
Subject, as he has expressed them in the Character of the _Misanthrope_;
but those only who are endowed with a true Greatness of Soul and Genius
can divest themselves of the little Images of Ridicule, and admire
Nature in her Simplicity and Nakedness. As for the little conceited Wits
of the Age, who can only shew their Judgment by finding Fault, they
cannot be supposed to admire these Productions [which [7]] have nothing
to recommend them but the Beauties of Nature, when they do not know how
to relish even those Compositions that, with all the Beauties of Nature,
have also the additional Advantages of Art. [8]</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec85.txt')">Virgil</a>_ himself would have touched upon, had the like
Story been told by that Divine <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('7', 'spec85.txt')">Poet</a>. For]</p><p>

[Footnote 8: Addison had incurred much ridicule from the bad taste of
the time by his papers upon Chevy Chase, though he had gone some way to
meet it by endeavouring to satisfy the Dennises of 'that polite age,'
with authorities from Virgil. Among the jests was a burlesque criticism
of Tom Thumb. What Addison thought of the 'little images of Ridicule'
set up against him, the last paragraph of this Essay shows, but the
collation of texts shows that he did flinch a little. We now see how he
modified many expressions in the reprint of this Essay upon the 'Babes
in the Wood'.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
