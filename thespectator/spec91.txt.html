<p>No. 91.               Thursday, June 14, 1711.              Steele.</p><p></p><p>'In furias ignemque ruunt, Amor omnibus Idem.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p>
Tho' the Subject I am now going upon would be much more properly the
Foundation of a Comedy, I cannot forbear inserting the Circumstances
which pleased me in the Account a <a name="topic4" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec91.txt')">young</a> <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec91.txt')">Lady</a> gave me of the Loves of a
Family in Town, which shall be nameless; or rather for the better Sound
and Elevation of the History, instead of Mr. and Mrs. such-a-one, I
shall <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec91.txt')">call</a> them by feigned Names. Without further Preface, you are to
know, that within the Liberties of the City of _Westminster_ lives the
Lady _Honoria_, a Widow about the Age of Forty, of a healthy
Constitution, gay Temper, and elegant Person. She dresses a little too
much like a Girl, affects a childish Fondness in the Tone of her Voice,
sometimes a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec91.txt')">pretty</a> Sullenness in the leaning of her Head, and now and
then a Down-cast of her Eyes on her Fan: Neither her Imagination nor her
Health would ever give her to know that she is turned of Twenty; but
that in the midst of these pretty Softnesses, and Airs of Delicacy and
Attraction, she has a tall Daughter within a Fortnight of Fifteen, who
impertinently comes into the Room, and towers so much towards <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec91.txt')">Woman</a>,
that her Mother is always checked by her Presence, and every Charm of
_Honoria_ droops at the Entrance of _<a name="topic10" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec91.txt')">Flavia</a>_. The <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec91.txt')">agreeable</a> _Flavia_
would be what she is not, as well as her Mother _Honoria_; but all their
Beholders are more partial to an Affectation of what a Person is growing
up to, than of what has been already enjoyed, and is gone for ever. It
is therefore allowed to _Flavia_ to look forward, but not to _Honoria_
to look back. _Flavia_ is no way dependent on her Mother with relation
to her Fortune, for which Reason they live almost upon an Equality in
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec91.txt')">Conversation</a>; and as _Honoria_ has given _Flavia_ to understand, that it
is ill-bred to be always calling Mother, _Flavia_ is as well pleased
never to be called Child. It happens by this means, that these <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec91.txt')">Ladies</a>
are generally Rivals in all Places where they appear; and the Words
Mother and Daughter never pass between them but out of Spite. _Flavia_
one Night at a Play observing _Honoria_ draw the Eyes of several in the
Pit, called to a Lady who sat by her, and bid her ask her Mother to lend
her her Snuff-Box for one Moment. Another Time, when a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec91.txt')">Lover</a> of
_Honoria_ was on his Knees beseeching the Favour to kiss her Hand,
_Flavia_ rushing into the Room, kneeled down by him and asked Blessing.
Several of these contradictory Acts of Duty have raised between them
such a Coldness that they generally converse when they are in mixed
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec91.txt')">Company</a> by way of talking at one another, and not to one another.
_Honoria_ is ever complaining of a certain Sufficiency in the young
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec91.txt')">Women</a> of this Age, who assume to themselves an Authority of carrying all
<a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec91.txt')">things</a> before them, as if they were Possessors of the Esteem of Mankind,
and all, who were but a Year before them in the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec91.txt')">World</a>, were neglected or
deceased. _Flavia_, upon such a Provocation, is sure to observe, that
there are <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec91.txt')">People</a> who can resign nothing, and know not how to give up
what they know they cannot hold; that there are those who will not allow
Youth their Follies, not because they are themselves past them, but
because they <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec91.txt')">love</a> to continue in them. These Beauties Rival each other
on all Occasions, not that they have always had the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec91.txt')">Lovers</a> but each
has kept up a Vanity to shew the other the Charms of her Lover. _Dick
Crastin_ and _Tom Tulip_, among many others, have of late been
Pretenders in this Family: _Dick_ to _Honoria_, _Tom_ to _Flavia_.
_Dick_ is the only surviving Beau of the last Age, and _Tom_ almost the
only one that keeps up that Order of Men in this.</p><p>I wish I could repeat the little Circumstances of a Conversation of the
four Lovers with the Spirit in which the young Lady, I had my Account
from, represented it at a Visit where I had the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec91.txt')">Honour</a> to be present;
but it seems _Dick Crastin_, the admirer of _Honoria_, and _Tom Tulip_,
the Pretender to _Flavia_, were purposely admitted together by the
Ladies, that each might shew the other that her Lover had the
Superiority in the Accomplishments of that sort of Creature whom the
sillier Part of Women call a fine Gentleman. As this Age has a much more
gross Taste in Courtship, as well as in every thing else, than the last
had, these Gentlemen are Instances of it in their different <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec91.txt')">Manner</a> of
Application. _Tulip_ is ever making Allusions to the Vigour of his
Person, the sinewy Force of his Make; while _Crastin_ professes a wary
Observation of the Turns of his <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec91.txt')">Mistress</a>'s Mind. _Tulip_ gives himself
the Air of a restless Ravisher, _Crastin_ practises that of a skilful
Lover. Poetry is the inseparable Property of every Man in Love; and as
Men of Wit write Verses on those Occasions, the rest of the World repeat
the Verses of others. These Servants of the Ladies were used to imitate
their Manner of Conversation, and allude to one another, rather than
interchange Discourse in what they said when they met. _Tulip_ the other
Day seized his Mistress's Hand, and repeated out of _Ovid's Art of
Love_,</p><p>_'Tis I can in soft Battles pass the Night,     }
Yet rise next Morning vigorous for the Fight,   }
Fresh as the Day, and active as the Light._     }</p><p>Upon hearing this, _Crastin_, with an Air of Deference, played
_Honoria_'s Fan, and repeated,</p><p>Sedley _has that prevailing gentle Art,         }
That can with a resistless Charm impart         }
The loosest Wishes to the chastest <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec91.txt')">Heart</a>:       }
Raise such a Conflict, kindle such a Fire,
Between declining Virtue and Desire,
Till the poor vanquish'd Maid dissolves away
In Dreams all Night, in Sighs and Tears all Day._ [1]</p><p>When _Crastin_ had uttered these Verses with a Tenderness which at once
spoke <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('10', 'spec91.txt')">Passion</a> and <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec91.txt')">Respect</a>, _Honoria_ cast a triumphant Glance at
_Flavia_, as exulting in the Elegance of _Crastin's_ Courtship, and
upbraiding her with the Homeliness of _Tulip's_. _Tulip_ understood the
Reproach, and in Return began to applaud the Wisdom of old amorous
Gentlemen, who turned their Mistress's Imagination as far as possible
from what they had long themselves forgot, and ended his Discourse with
a sly Commendation of the Doctrine of _Platonick_ Love; at the same time
he ran over, with a laughing Eye, _Crastin's_ thin Legs, meagre Looks,
and spare Body. The old Gentleman immediately left the Room with some
Disorder, and the Conversation fell upon untimely Passion, After-Love,
and unseasonable Youth. _Tulip_ sung, danced, moved before the Glass,
led his Mistress half a Minuet, hummed</p><p>Celia _the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('4', 'spec91.txt')">Fair</a>, in the bloom of Fifteen_;</p><p>when there came a Servant with a Letter to him, which was as follows.</p><p>
SIR,</p><p>'I understand very well what you meant by your Mention of _Platonick_
Love. I shall be glad to meet you immediately in _Hide-Park_, or
behind _Montague-House_, or attend you to Barn-Elms, [2] or any other
fashionable Place that's fit for a Gentleman to die in, that you shall
appoint for,</p><p>_Sir, Your most Humble Servant_,
Richard Crastin.</p><p>_Tulip's_ Colour changed at the reading of this Epistle; for which
Reason his Mistress snatched it to read the Contents. While she was
doing so _Tulip_ went away, and the Ladies now agreeing in a Common
Calamity, bewailed together the Danger of their Lovers. They immediately
undressed to go out, and took Hackneys to prevent Mischief: but, after
alarming all Parts of the Town, _Crastin_ was found by his Widow in his
Pumps at _Hide-Park_, which Appointment _Tulip_ never kept, but made his
Escape into the Country. _Flavia_ tears her Hair for his inglorious
Safety, curses and despises her Charmer, is fallen in Love with
_Crastin_: Which is the first Part of the History of the _Rival Mother_.</p><p>R.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: Rochester's 'Imitations of Horace', Sat. I. 10.]</p><p>

surrounded by the Thames.]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
