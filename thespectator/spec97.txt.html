<p>No. 97.                 Thursday, June 21, 1711.               Steele.</p><p></p><p>'Projecere animas.'</p><p>Virg.</p><p>
Among the loose Papers which I have frequently spoken of heretofore, I
find a <a name="topic31" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec97.txt')">Conversation</a> between _<a name="topic5" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec97.txt')">Pharamond</a>_ and _Eucrate_ upon the Subject
of Duels, and the Copy of an Edict issued in Consequence of that
Discourse.</p><p>_Eucrate_ argued, that nothing but the most severe and vindictive
Punishments, such as placing the Bodies of the Offenders in Chains, and
putting them to <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec97.txt')">Death</a> by the most exquisite Torments, would be
sufficient to extirpate a Crime which had so long prevailed and was so
firmly fixed in the Opinion of the <a name="topic48" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec97.txt')">World</a> as <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec97.txt')">great</a> and laudable; but the
<a name="topic39" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec97.txt')">King</a> answered, That indeed Instances of Ignominy were necessary in the
Cure of this Evil; but considering that it prevailed only among such as
had a Nicety in their Sense of <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec97.txt')">Honour</a>, and that it often happened that a
Duel was fought to save Appearances to the World, when both Parties were
in their Hearts in Amity and Reconciliation to each other; it was
evident that turning the Mode another way would effectually put a Stop
to what had Being only as a Mode. That to such Persons, Poverty and
<a name="topic6" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec97.txt')">Shame</a> were Torments sufficient, That he would not go further in
punishing in others Crimes which he was satisfied he himself was most
<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec97.txt')">Guilty</a> of, in that he might have prevented them by speaking his
Displeasure sooner. Besides which the King said, he was in general
averse to Tortures, which was putting <a name="topic19" /><a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec97.txt')">Human</a> Nature it self, rather than
the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec97.txt')">Criminal</a>, to Disgrace; and that he would be sure not to use this
Means where the Crime was but an <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec97.txt')">ill</a> Effect arising from a laudable
Cause, the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec97.txt')">Fear</a> of Shame. The King, at the same time, spoke with much
Grace upon the Subject of Mercy; and repented of many Acts of that kind
which had a magnificent Aspect in the doing, but dreadful Consequences
in the Example. Mercy to Particulars, he observed, was Cruelty in the
General: That though a <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec97.txt')">Prince</a> could not revive a Dead Man by taking the
Life of him who killed him, neither could he make Reparation to the next
that should die by the evil Example; or answer to himself for the
Partiality, in not pardoning the next as well as the former Offender.</p><p>'As for me, says _Pharamond_, I have conquer'd _<a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec97.txt')">France</a>_, and yet have
given Laws to my <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec97.txt')">People</a>: The Laws are my Methods of Life; they are not
a Diminution but a Direction to my Power. I am still absolute to
distinguish the Innocent and the <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec97.txt')">Virtuous</a>, to give Honours to the
Brave and Generous: I am absolute in my Good-will: none can oppose my
Bounty, or prescribe Rules for my Favour. While I can, as I please,
reward the Good, I am under no Pain that I cannot pardon the Wicked:
For which Reason, continued _Pharamond_, I will effectually put a stop
to this Evil, by exposing no more the Tenderness of my Nature to the
Importunity of having the same <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec97.txt')">Respect</a> to those who are miserable by
their Fault, and those who are so by their Misfortune. Flatterers
(concluded the King smiling) repeat to us Princes, that we are
Heaven's <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('6', 'spec97.txt')">Vice</a>-regents; Let us be so, and let the only thing out of our
Power be _to do Ill_.'</p><p>'Soon after the Evening wherein _Pharamond_ and _Eucrate_ had this
Conversation, the following Edict was Published.</p><p>
_Pharamond's_ Edict against Duels.</p><p>Pharamond, _King of the_ Gauls, _to all his loving <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec97.txt')">Subjects</a> sendeth
Greeting_.</p><p>Whereas it has come to our Royal Notice and Observation, that in
contempt of all Laws Divine and Human, it is of late become a Custom
among the Nobility and Gentry of this our Kingdom, upon slight and
trivial, as well as great and urgent Provocations, to invite each
other into the Field, there by their own Hands, and of their own
Authority, to decide their Controversies by Combat; We have thought
fit to take the said Custom into our Royal Consideration, and find,
upon Enquiry into the usual Causes whereon such fatal Decisions have
arisen, that by this wicked Custom, maugre all the Precepts of our
Holy Religion, and the Rules of right Reason, the greatest Act of the
human Mind, _Forgiveness of Injuries_, is become vile and shameful;
that the Rules of Good Society and Virtuous Conversation are hereby
inverted; that the Loose, the Vain, and the Impudent, insult the
Careful, the Discreet, and the Modest; that all <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec97.txt')">Virtue</a> is suppressed,
and all Vice supported, in the one Act of being capable to dare to the
Death. We have also further, with great <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('5', 'spec97.txt')">Sorrow</a> of Mind, observed that
this Dreadful <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('19', 'spec97.txt')">Action</a>, by long Impunity, (our Royal Attention being
employed upon Matters of more general Concern) is become Honourable,
and the Refusal to engage in it Ignominious. In these our Royal Cares
and Enquiries We are yet farther made to understand, that the Persons
of most Eminent Worth, and most hopeful Abilities, accompanied with
the strongest Passion for true <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('48', 'spec97.txt')">Glory</a>, are such as are most liable to
be involved in the Dangers arising from this Licence. Now taking the
said Premises into our serious Consideration, and well weighing that
all such Emergencies (wherein the Mind is incapable of commanding it
self, and where the Injury is too sudden or too exquisite to be born)
are particularly provided for by Laws heretofore enacted; and that the
Qualities of less Injuries, like those of Ingratitude, are too nice
and delicate to come under General Rules; We do resolve to blot this
Fashion, or Wantonness of Anger, out of the Minds of Our Subjects, by
Our Royal Resolutions declared in this Edict, as follow.</p><p>No Person who either Sends or Accepts a Challenge, or the Posterity of
either, tho' no Death ensues thereupon, shall be, after the
Publication of this our Edict, capable of bearing Office in these our
Dominions.</p><p>The Person who shall prove the sending or receiving a Challenge, shall
receive to his own Use and Property, the whole Personal Estate of both
Parties: and their Real Estate shall be immediately vested in the next
Heir of the Offenders in as ample <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('31', 'spec97.txt')">Manner</a> as if the said Offenders were
actually Deceased.</p><p>In Cases where the Laws (which we have already granted to our
Subjects) admit of an Appeal for Blood; when the Criminal is condemned
by the said Appeal, He shall not only suffer Death, but his whole
Estate, Real, Mixed, and Personal, shall from the Hour of his Death be
vested in the next Heir of the Person whose Blood he spilt.</p><p>That it shall not hereafter be in our Royal Power, or that of our
Successors, to pardon the said Offences, or restore [the Offenders
[1]] in their Estates, Honour, or Blood for ever.</p><p>_Given at our <a href="javascript:popup_seealso('39', 'spec97.txt')">Court</a> at_ Blois, _the 8th of_ February, 420. _In the
Second Year of our Reign_.</p><p>
T.</p><p></p><p>[Footnote 1: them]</p><p></p><p></p><p>*       *       *       *       *</p><p></p><p></p><p>
